Emma Thompson , Alan Rickman , Carla Gugino and Gil Bellows are a delectation in this sexy joke . This film is smart , edge of your bottom entertainment for adults , and what a relief that is in these days of big concept predictable cartoons . Great music and camera work add to the fun that is this New Orleans - set puzzle . Highly Recommended . Ten stars ! sub_rate: 0.04225352112676056; NE_rate: 0.0

A delectation from start to finish . If you do n't like the Muppets , then I just have to feel sorry for you . This wondrous film does n't simply cash in on the Muppets ' popularity -- it 's a well - conceived and well - written film in its own right . It 's got large songs , and it has that thread of wistful melancholy that was always present in Jim Henson 's creations and which is most personified in the character of Kermit the Frog . I always responded to this as a kid , and it 's what makes the Muppets still pleasurable to me as an adult when other material aimed at children drives me sick . A huge cast of bad names appearing in cameos makes this film feel like a kiddie - sized version of " Around the World in 80 Days , " except that it 's about 80 times better .

Based on Mika Waltari 's Book , This Second CinemaScope movie ever made is full of rich color , beautiful music and panoramic spectacle . The Plot sometimes gets muddled in contrite wording , But all in all it has a strong social content : Man is ruled by his emotions , and that every action has an adequate consequence . But to truly enjoy this film , First see the movie , then read the book . Although different , it sheds light on a whole mess of things that were not seen on the screen , and gives breath to some more of the depth of Sinuhe . sub_rate: 0.01818181818181818; NE_rate: 0.0
This is a serious motion that lays bare the inequities of the so - called upper class and those who work for them , the haves and have - nots . Robert Shaw does a creditable problem in his role as the obliging , correct chauffeur , Steven Ledbetter , who helps Lee Lee ( Sarah Miles ) overcome her mental depression at the outset . However , Steven has many mixed feelings regarding this dame of the upper class . He inevitably falls in love with her , which of course is overstepping the societal boundaries that separate them . I have not read anything prior to this and merely judge the movie as I have seen it . I consider it a really reliable floor about the realities of daily living and the conflict of what we might wish or expect from life and what we get . It 's a hunky drama worth seeing again . sub_rate: 0.06918238993710692; NE_rate: 0.09090909090909091
Watching this movie , I ca n't help drawing the comparison between it and Wild Reeds , another thoughtful film about teenagers coming of age . Like Wild Reeds , this movie is boring and the director would not be hurried . So if you want a quick resolution to things , do n't watch it . This movie is like a slice of life , beginning imperfectly and ending imperfectly . There 's no resolution to anything , no happily ever after for anybody , just like real life . This movie is as real as it gets . The acting is astonishingly dear . The director is fond of long , really long , shots and the actors and actresses excel at showing subtlety and inner thoughts . I love this movie . I virtually did n't watch it but now I ' m very glad that I did . It 's not a movie for everyone but if you 're willing to let it grow on you , you will be rewarded.10/10 sub_rate: 0.022988505747126436; NE_rate: 0.0
Wow .. I just saw this movie on BAD BAD BAD , and it really is bizarre . I may not be a film expert , but it 's probably the most bizarre film I , as an average movie fan , have seen . Whoever came up with with it had a great imagination . I ' m a bit of a fan of Japanese dramas , and there are often actors from dramas in movies .. ( Matsushima Nanako , for example , the lead in Ringu , is a major j - drama star . ) But it looks like this is the first film BAD Kirie and Shuichi 's portrayers . I must say , if they really are debuting here , they do a dear good job . Kirie was a very sympathetic character , I thought she was easy to relate with . She was kind and good - hearted , perhaps not the most popular girl but nicer than some of the other attention - seeking girls . She was also pretty in a classic kind of way . I hope she does more films , but it 's been a couple years so maybe she has no such plans . The ending was odd . I ' m not going to give anything away , but the rest of the movie 's bizarreness was kind of put to shame . Very bizarre really but very imaginative and unique movie . I 'd recommend it for Japanese horror fans , though I 'll warn you , it 's a mess more bizarre than Ringu . Nonetheless , I 'd give it a 7.5 out of 10 , for originality , imagination , good characterization , above average acting merely and just being plain intriguing . sub_rate: 0.02666666666666667; NE_rate: 0.125
The Cure is a wondrous film about a boy with AIDS . I ' ve cried about 4 times watching this film and it 's just so sad . I ca n't promise everyone will cry watching this but it will make you want to . Very emotional and very sad , The Cure is a must - see movie . It shows you the meaning of friendship and love and is an extremely heavy movie . At first I did n't think it would be as great and wondered why my mum always cried watching it . But now I know it 's a stunning film that is so original and is so close to real life situations , unlike most of the other films that does n't make sense .

An enjoyable movie, without a doubt, and very evocative of both its era and that very particular stage in any boy's 'rites of passage'. But I have to say that having read the very positive comments here, I was a bit disappointed. The period was captured, but the plot was desperately thin. The whole thing revolves around the most egregious bit of miscasting in the history of school plays. The idea that quack quack would ever be chosen to play not only one of only three star turns, but a philanderer, is risible. And without that, nada. The sub-plots bore no relation that I could see to the main plot - all of them could be removed in their entirety without in any way affecting the main story - which surely suggests a fundamental flaw. When all your sub-plots look like padding, you know a central idea is being stretched beyond its limits. Nevertheless, it's a benign movie with its heart in the right place, there are some fine performances, and you just get the feeling that everyone involved felt deflated at the final 'cut!' That good feeling permeates the film. And that has to count for something. A flawed really quite good movie. 7 out of 10. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
Spoiler begin The movie focuses on three friends , Samantha ( Summer Phoenix ) , Chris ( Nick Stahl ) , and Owen ( Aaron Paul ) . The movie starts out with Sam and Owen as the drug addicts , and Chris , the track star , as the one who takes care of them . As things get increasingly worse at home for Chris , he asks Sam what the drug is like . Sam is out of rehab and sober by this point and tells him it makes everything better . Chris then catches up with Owen and they start using . It takes chris two times till he is a " full time member " . After some trouble with a dealer and a confession to Sam , she gets in again . So begins the downward spiral for them . Chris od 's when he breaks a promise to Sam ( I want some of the movie to be a surprise ) . He dies , Sam gets in to college to be an Architect , and Owen gets arrested . so ends the storySpoiler ends . minor spoilers throughoutNick stahl is awful . He will have an Oscar one day . His portrayal of Chris was Heartbreaking . He was the only one that felt real in the movie as far as drug use goes . Aaron Paul who played Owen acted as if he were on speed not heroin . Summer Phoenix was fine , she is talented but what can i say Nick Stahl stole the movie . His drugged eyes , his dull movements , everything was utter . The writers needed to show withdrawls in the movie . That is a main reason why people do n't want to quit . Other then that there are hilarious scenes ( the mall scene , and the Backstreet boy scene , man Stahl nailed the reactions right on the principal . ) , Touching , sad scenes ( Like the scene between Sam and Chris in her bedroom after he gets beat up , i bawled , and the park scene . ) . It was realistic too . Like S am using again when Chris wanted to flush the drug down the toilet , and Chris using again after he goes to Own 's , even though he had been clean for two weeks , the pull was too strong . it is all realistic . Watch the movie for a great cast , great music , and a semi- truthful account of drug addiction . sub_rate: 0.009195402298850575; NE_rate: 0.0
A piece backwards I bought the Christian corner exercise of Fist of the north wizard which came with all of Fist of the north wizard , Fist of the north wizard 2 , New Fist of the north wizard , and Jaws Jaws Jaws Jaws Jaws Jaws picture . While there is an Christian edition and a few Christian Versions , they end zero room through Jaws Jaws Jaws Jaws Jaws which is virtually equally far as the picture goes . The series is about the replacement of an ancient martial artwork called Lee Lee Lee ( Fist of the north star ) named Lee , or Lee for poor . There is merely one replacement each propagation . It takes situation in a station apocalyptic time where martial graphics is the most brawny arm . The zero most brawny humanities exist Lee Lee Lee and Lee Lee Lee as my reading calls it . Lee is actually multiple styles but they exist all the same since they allow a somebody to chop somebody to pieces . There exist zero BAD masters and each has their own principal . Seagal is an artwork that allows person to damage / shoot or bring somebody by hitting a head on their eubstance . Each artwork has their own configuration . BAD BAD BAD BAD , Lee Lee Lee . Lee goes close saving the man from vicious consisting of going after his zero brothers and zero of the Seagal masters and their armies . Each ground police has their own room of combat which makes each sequence different and the figure of soldiers bloody . as , Lee is looking for his girl Lee who was stolen by the Lee passe Lee . Along the journey Lee is joined by his blood Lee after rescuing him from his blood Lee who calls himself Seagal or Shannon Shannon . He is too joined by zero BAD masters Lee , who is looking for his baby who was taken by Lee 's blood Lee , and Lee . Both of them and Lee die along the room . former characters that join Lee exist zero kids Rin and Lee who do n't get much . That 's virtually equally practically as I can suppose for report since its indeed foresightful and entire of details . The series is too divided into zero parts . What makes this show great is the fighting . Ken normally goes up against a group of people that think they are tough and then get killed in one hit . Which is funny and badass , but makes for quick fights . Another great part is comedy / badassness . Ken hits someone , and they think its nothing . Ken says they are already dead . Then they die . Other parts are when he 'll hit them and tell them they have a few seconds to live . Then a counter will pop up . Or when he tells them they are not worthy of knowing his name . Then there is when he does a rapid fire kick or punch and goes wa da da da da da da etc . Eventually you might find yourself doing it with him . One great part was when a bad guy thought he knew Hokuto . He went up to Ken and hit him . Ken stood there said he was dead in a few seconds . The bad guy counted off then died . It is n't limited to Ken everyone else kills just as quick . There has never been a character as awesome as Ken and their probably never will . There are a few problems though . One is the repetitive nature . Some flashbacks mainly the one with Yuria being taken are played too much , and there are also too many recap episodes especially in part four of the series . In fact , the last episode is a recap of the whole thing . Another problem is the ending . The final battle with Rao was n't that impressive . Ken and Rao fought then talked , etc , until Rao came to some realization and kills himself instead of Ken killing him . But it is better than the American and European versions that just cut off halfway . Who would I recommend this for ? This is for older teenagers and adults who like action . Since the styles cause people to explode or get cut into pieces , the violence is very graphic and there is a lot of it , but they do n't show much blood because they usually make the death just a silhouette that still looks like the person but less colorful . This was probably done to avoid censorship . If you do n't like action rent the American Version . If you like action though , then I say go for the import since you can see all of the series , but they do not have the best English translation since it is subtitled by the Chinese . Note : My import came with everything I said at the beginning , some imported versions do not , but you still have to get an import to see all of the series and Fist of the North Star 2 . If you do n't think you can handle the subtitles for any reason then go get the American Version . Another note : In the version I got no subtitles were on the last disc for New Fist of the North Star ; although , New Fist of the North Star is n't very good to begin with . I give the show an 8/10 for its high amount of action , good story , and the awesomeness of Kenshiro.****UPDATE****Toei Animation released an English subtitled version . You can download the episodes as well as Hokuto no Ken 2 from IGN 's Direct2Drive or watch it free on FUNimation 's site . sub_rate: 0.14257425742574256; NE_rate: 0.14583333333333334

Watching this uproariously retroactive but really entertaining vocation daughter story , I was floored by Lee Lee Lee sixth appearance . All I could imagine initially was , " My idol , it 's the same side as Lee Lee in his infamous reservation picture ! " minutes minutes minutes into the picture , Lee Lee and Lee Lee have out of a taxi in Seagal Seagal . As they walk down the street , you can run piece of a preindication in cover of them for BAD BAD BAD -- scenery of the epochal " riots " that exist considered the gun for the modernistic festal rights trend . Speaking of Lee and taxis , I had to laugh when she gets into one and tells the cabbie , " sixth and Lee Lee , please -- and be deliberate of the bumps . " Can you guess the response to that from a device in Friday 's Seagal ? ! She says that , of class , because she 's significant and does n't require to suffer the fetus . But that does n't contain her from jump away OF A MOVING machine when she finds out Lee Lee wants her to suffer an abortion !

I'm really proud of the job they did and of how they did n't forget along the movie the message they wanted us to receive , not caring for the money , but actually working with a short budget , letting us appreciate the beautiful scenarios and the great photography .

Lee Lee has been acting for Friday Friday nowadays , and while she will never fly the portion of BAD BAD in Jaws Jaws Jaws Jaws , few of her subsequent revulsion films possess used her legendary condition to such large result as " witchery " does . She plays Lee Lee , a significant individual womanhood who travels with her category to an abandoned island hotel that her parents want to buy . They exist accompanied by a pair of actual land agents ( Lee Lee and Lee Lee ) and upon arriving at the island they meet a photographer ( Lee Lee ) and his author girl ( Lee Lee ) who exist lawlessly squatting in the hotel while investigating the caption of a local beldame ( Lee Lee ) . It seems that a long - ago beldame - search resulted in her self , and she was with kid at the prison . incognizant of the risk , Lee has late dreamt of the beldame 's dramatic destruction , and Lee 's slight blood Lee ( Lee Lee ) has been more now visited by her spooky , inkiness - clad life , which he calls ' the dame in pitch ' . The group 's prison at the island auberge begins restfully enough ; obscure to them , even , the lady in Seagal has already dispatched the police of their hired boat ( Lee Lee ) . Before long , the isolation and frigid begin to bear everyone , and it is during this time of moodiness and stress that the lady in Seagal begins her sovereignty of panic . She plans to retaliate her own destiny by possessing Lee and sacrificing her companions and her unborn baby . Each of her former victims fulfills an scene of her revengeful nemesis - rapacity , lustfulness , and the line of a virgin . As the sunlight goes down and the sea becomes crazy , she haunts them zero by zero in sick , horrifying ways . The island position is efficaciously chilling , and the auberge is really creepy and hauntingly shot . It 's such a colourful picture that it reminds me of Lee Lee Lee study . The light is first , and the set medallion is utterly nervous . The soundtrack is really good and singular . The revulsion effects exist extreme , terrifying , and unforgettable . The cinematography is great , and it is this that brings us back to Linda Blair . The creative team behind this film shoots her like a horror star should be shot : lots of dramatic push - ins , lingering close - ups that subtly detail Jane 's incremental possession , and moments that are reminiscent of other great horror films . There are hidden homages to " Rosemary 's Baby " , " Jacob 's Ladder " , " The Shining " , " Black Sunday " , and of course " The Exorcist " . She does a great job , and absolutely steals the show with her moody and understated performance . That is n't to say that the rest of the cast disappoints ; Catherine Hickland is sexy and very good , and veteran performer Annie Ross is memorable as Jane 's bitchy mother Rose . Hasselhoff gives it his best , but he is not essentially a film star , and his television persona gets in the way of his performance . Blair and young Michael Manchester have a wonderful chemistry together . The film is otherwise so violent and creepy ( in a good way ) that it desperately needs their warmth ( Blair also played a mother in 2003 's " Monster Makers " , and her maternal scenes in that film have the same tender feeling to them ) . Lastly , Hildegard Knef ( in one of her last roles ) plays a great witch , and she has the most amazing voice and accent . Along with Blair , she was also perfectly cast . But it 's Blair 's movie all the way . Jane Brooks also seems to have some psychic ability , and this aspect of the film hearkens back to " Exorcist II : The Heretic " . I think " Witchery " is up there with " The Exorcist " , " Exorcist II " , " Hell Night " , and " Summer of Fear " as Blair 's best genre work to date . sub_rate: 0.16205533596837945; NE_rate: 0.04878048780487805
I lately visited the Seagal Seagal as an adult with my momma , her best friend and my adult baby . BAD BAD is frequently erroneously perceived as a property for hardly children , but when you hear timber shows like Lee 's Philharmagic , you realize that the deception of BAD is for everyone ! It was such a large display that we left the field and turned around and got in production over . And so a sixth meter . It was utterly breathtaking . I would promote anyone who goes to BAD BAD to contain out this display , which is not hardly a display but a existence current , fun filled ride with Lee as he formerly over lets his snappishness suffer him in problem ! sub_rate: 0.3076923076923077; NE_rate: 0.025
It does not surprise me that this poor ( minutes minutes ) barn / due motion that was made Friday Friday Friday in Seagal Seagal Seagal during the poor point called " ottepel ' " or " the warming " , has gained indeed much passion and wonder among the picture lovers over the mankind . It is noble and attractively filmed . Some scenes feel like there were made fashion beforehand of their prison . Lee Lee Lee tv study and creative discoveries were included in the school books and widely imitated . The picture tells the moving and timeless floor of passion destroyed by unmerciful warfare but forever awake in the computer of a untried womanhood . It is likewise the movie about dedication , memories , power to survive on when it seems there is zip to survive for ; it is about forgiveness , and about promise . The motion received ( utterly deservingly ) Hugo Hugo Hugo at Hugo Hugo Hugo and BAD BAD was chosen as a recipient of a extra honour at Cannes for playing Lee , the untried daughter jubilantly in passion with the best mankind in the existence in the root of the picture . After detachment with her beloved who went to the movement , the release of her mob in the bomb ride , and the man to the humanity she never loved and exclusively wished he never existed , she turned to the shadower of herself , she became utter inwardly . Her foresightful journey to salvation , to lastly accepting expiry of her dear and to learning how to know with it , is a fascinating and heartbreaking one and it merely wo n't pull any witness unbiassed . For me , the picture is really personal and costly because I was born and grew up in the city where its characters lived and were indeed felicitous in the root . I walked the same streets , squares , and bridges over Malta Malta Malta . Every fellowship in the old Seagal Seagal had lost zero zero zero but frequently zero zero zero fellowship appendage to a scrap or to the assiduousness refugee or to the ghetto or to thirstiness , frigid , and illnesses during Hugo and my fellowship is not elision . My mother and granny knew the horrors of state and never healing infliction of losses not just from the movies and the books . " Cranes are Flying " speaks to me clearly and honestly and touches me very deeply .

"Idiocracy" is the latest film to come from Mike "Office Space" Judge, and it certainly follows a similar theme of that film in the fact that it is an observation of stupidity and how mediocrity can overcome adversity... relatively speaking. It is a story about Joe Bauer (Luke Wilson), who is, quite literally, the most average guy in existence. Joe, and a prostitute named Rita (Maya Rudolph), become the test subjects for a military project of a hibernation chamber. They were to remain suspended for only one year, but due to lack of oversight, Joe and Rita are forgotten about and accidentally wake up 500 years in the future.Here's the scary part: This film explains, in a very realistic and plausible way, how the entire population of 2505 became absolutely retarded. With no natural predators, the evolution of the human species does not necessarily favor the quickest, smartest, and strongest people for progression of genes... just the people who breed the most. Unfortunately, those people happen to be welfare-sucking, trailer trash idiots who breed like rabbits. This abundant reproduction of the stupid people has caused an adverse effect on societal growth and now Joe and Rita are the two smartest human beings on the face of the planet. If it helps, imagine the entire population as just a hybrid of rednecks, jocks, cholos and hoochies. Seeing this nightmarish dystopia, Joe learns of and attempts to track down a time machine to see if he and Rita can get back to when they came from, and that's basically the whole plot.But despite how one-dimensional I may make it sound, this movie is higher brow than you can fathom. Nuances are everywhere and anyone can see glimpses (warning signs, if you will) of modern day dumb-ciety permeating facets of everyday life and turning it into the train wreck on display in "Idiocracy." The film has some truly awesome showcases of realistic retardedness put on a pedestal. I don't want to give anything away and ruin jokes for you, but let's just say that it is pretty thorough. I can see how some would say that it is just a lot of toilet humor, but it, odd as it may seem, has a purpose; to show how dumb and crass these people are.This film, unfortunately, is destined to see the same fate as its predecessor, "Office Space"; no one will see it in theaters, but everyone will brag about discovering this awesome/funny movie when it comes out on video. My only complaint for the film would be that the flow of the narrative sometimes gets broken so they can do a Hitchhiker's-Guide-to-the-Galaxy type exposition on how things got to be where they are, but it is a necessary evil and is implemented better here. Other than that, good characters, funny jokes, and better-than-average social commentary wrapped up in a funny bow.Final Note: If seeing our youth becoming gang-banger wanna-be's, acting like redneck/ ghetto trash and being proud of it... if you are educated and cultured in anyway and can see how our country is spiraling out of control into an abyss of stupidity, for god sakes, watch this movie. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
The film starts with promise because there is more interaction between Spanky and Buckwheat , but as the film progresses , the two boys have fewer scenes together . This slows the step considerably . Billie " Buckwheat " St. gives a really solid operation in his early scenes . When he is left behind on the riverboat , his fear and abandonment are palpable and his tears are truly heartbreaking . When he goes from man to man asking for help and is repeatedly rejected the viewer really begins to wonder if this is a comedy or not . Watching a children 's birthday party through a picket fence is another moving minute . As another reviewer mentioned , I was also worried about the big dog choking on chicken bones ! Once Spanky and Buckwheat are in Marshall Valiant 's home , Spanky tends to interact mainly with the adults and the chemistry of the children is essentially lost . The Old South / Huck Finn - type setting really does n't do much for the plot except allow the children to be out of doors a heavy mess . Ralph Morgan is the most engaging adult , but then the other roles really do n't have much substance to them . Louise Beavers manages some laughable moments with a Yankee soldier towards the destruction . The villains are n't really villainous enough and the lovers not intense enough . Yet , I do think it 's worth viewing if you 're an Our Gang enthusiast , if for no other reason that the odd curiosity of the whole piece . I give it seven stars because , while not a outstanding movie , it kept me engaged the whole time and curious as to what would happen next . sub_rate: 0.03642384105960265; NE_rate: 0.0
Describing BAD as a war film may be a bit inaccurate . Sure it centers on the longest and bloodiest battle in world history , in the most expansive theater of the most costly war in terms of lives , money , and matériel that has ever occurred . Yes it contains action scenes depicting bitter battles and terrible destruction . The visceral storytelling and harsh images though make it something more than a war film , even more than an anti - war film . Stalingrad is instead a film about absolute and undeniable hell . The film is fraught with visual descriptions of the worst kind of war , one that is intensely personal and close , where days are spent in taking one city block , only to have it re - taken in a surprise assault . The early form of modern urban warfare that the Germans came to call Rattenkrieg ( Rat Warfare ) is depicted in brutal and uncompromising terms . The characters war in sewer tunnels , rail yards , and from building to building in the hellish bomb - scape of ruined Stalingrad , only to be defeated by the unforgiving Russian winter . The film deals with the issue of Nazism and the vilification of Germans in that period in the way that many other films from both Germany and the rest of the world do . Its characters are a group of soldiers swept along by the winds of war and simply attempting to make it out with themselves and as many of their comrades as possible alive . The characters do not fight the Soviets out of any ideological hatred between National Socialism and Soviet Communism , not for any grand dream of Grossdeutschland or racial superiority . They fight only because if they do not the enemy will kill them , and if the enemy does not then their own officers certainly will for refusing to fight . This portrayal adds another layer to the suffocating envelope of trapped hopelessness that pervades the film . A sort of ground based companion to Das Boot , Stalingrad frames the epic struggle of World War Two in a personal light and from the unexpected perspective of the ordinary German soldier as a sort of hero made tragic by circumstance and a brutal government that would pervert his sacrifice . sub_rate: 0.002506265664160401; NE_rate: 0.0
In an earlier comment I mentioned how practically I enjoyed this motion - better sixth time around . I do n't resile from that impression . Strangely , I ca n't happen anyone else who did like it . My mother was going to see it but several friends told her " No way " . My sister and her family saw it and half the theatre walked out part - way through . My wife 's suggestion is that Australians see the characters as hardly normal , mundane Americans and therefore it 's not laughable . But , hey , most Americans think all Australians are like Crocodile Dundee , indeed it 's gracious to throw the boot on the other foot for a change . sub_rate: 0.08661417322834646; NE_rate: 0.09090909090909091

This is what happens to Anwar el Ibrahimi at the beginning of the movie . His is a story of pain and ( literally ) torture . It 's one of several story lines . One follows his wife 's attempts to get more information . One follows the frigid cold ) bureaucrats behind the rendition . Another story deals with the family of the man who leads the interrogation of Anwar el Ibrahimi . There are some other stories too and by the end they all neatly come together . Though the more famous actors like Reese Witherspoon ( as the distraught pregnant wife ) Jake Gyllenhaal ( as the CIA rookie forced to watch the interrogation in Northern Africa ) and Meryl Streep ( as BAD hotshot Corine Whitman ) it is really the more unknown actors that carry the story and give it it meat heart . For me the actor playing the unfortunate Mr El Ibrahimi ( Omar Metwally ) was the heart and soul of this movie . His portrayal of a man in distress was shockingly well done . It 's almost as if he was being tortured for real ! Also worker actor Yigal Naor was very impressive as the part worried family piece man piece part extremely cruel chief of torture . Hard to watch and not exactly fun , but still very worthwhile . sub_rate: 0.017142857142857144; NE_rate: 0.16666666666666666
I must say it was a let down . Overall its large to see the way Aparna Sen has handled the issue of schizophrenia , I am not much knowledgeable on this and got whatever it was depicted in A Beautiful Mind , and here too its interesting portrayal . But the thing that caused the let down for me was the artificial dialogues and over use of English . Its true that a new class is being formed/ has been formed in India which talks in English even at home , but I am sure its not as formal as in the movie . Moreover , Waheeda Rehmaan did not seem very comfortable talking everything in English . Charu 's dialogue in BAD tone was seemingly much more realistic and digestible . The second thing , its about the abstract flavor she has tried to give to the movie . I generally like movies with open ending , but here there were many loose ends . Its like cut pieces are joined together to make the movie . Also there seemed no central theme to the movie . Schizophernia for sure was the main line but intermingling sister - sister , mother - daughter , adding doctor - azmi relation , no real use of brother , Bose - Bose 's wife relations ..... all were not required and made the audience loose track of what actually did she try to depict . On the whole , a watch for people who like off - beat movies , a must avoid for the ones who just see movies as an entertainment tool . sub_rate: 0.0072992700729927005; NE_rate: 0.0
Double Shock is one of the many good Columbo episodes which reaches the level of a good movie . It has all the elements we like in the Columbo episodes . We get the laugh when Columbo makes something clumsy , and it happens more than once in Double Shock . I can almost guarantee that you will laugh several times if you decide to watch this episode . We also get the riddle as usual with an almost perfect murder , but something about the murder troubles Columbo . The end is the usual , we get the story about how Columbo solved the mystery . This is another good BAD - episode , and I will rate it 7/10 . It is close to 8/10."Just one more question " - The acting ? Peter Falk is very serious as usual . sub_rate: 0.013986013986013986; NE_rate: 0.5

I , being a fan of Lee Lee , rented this picture Friday Friday Friday Friday . I thought it was a really easily written picture with a crew of large actors . It was entertaining , and showed that Lee Lee could represent more than his most easily known type of Lee Lee . His pernicious characterization of Lee and everyone else 's neat playacting made this picture really likeable . Lee , a really timid boy with a exceedingly spiritual and raw mother , is looking for a problem . He finds zero and becomes the , I pretend you could send " help " to BAD , a retired actress . At sixth , it is merely a mode for him to pull some money . But after a piece , he and Evie seem to educate a friendship . Evie helps Lee fail out of his plate a slight and gets him to suffer fun and be felicitous with himself , and in the death they both seem to take each former . Whether you exist a fan of Lee Lee or not , this picture is a actually entertaining one with some really cunning and moments . I extremely recommend it to anybody who wants to examine a big picture with expectant and talented actors . sub_rate: 0.2986425339366516; NE_rate: 0.07575757575757576
Forget about the plot of this movie . Forget about the fact that it is wonderfully acted by Vince Vaughn and Vincend D'Onofrio . Forget about the fact that it is one of the few movies starring Jennifer Lopez that I can stomach . Although the story made be impossible to believe and much of the dialogue seems contrived , the one and only important thing to remember when contemplating watching this movie is that it contains some of the most awful and disturbing imagery ever put on film . It is as if Salvador Dali decided to make a crime drama .

I need help identifying an episode of King of Queens . It begins with a scene where Doug is talking to Carrie on the phone , and he suggests that they agree to stop ending every conversation with " I love you . " However , it 's severe to do and he ends up calling her back , only to close with " I have you . " It 's a really ingenious moment and one I think says a mess about relationships that have lasted a long time . I THINK ( but I ' m sure ) that 's it 's the same episode where Doug gets some local construction guys to whistle and throw lurid comments at Carrie to perk her spirits up .

Favela Rising is a documentary about the slums of Rio , the favelas , specifically the most violent one , Vigário Geral . According to this film , a mess more kids have died violently in Rio 's favelas over the last decade or so than in Israel / Palestine during the same period -- a fact astonishing if true , which shows how under - recognized this social problem is in the rest of the world . This is an crucial issue , especially for those who see hope in grassroots efforts to marshal the neediest and most at risk through a vibrant cultural computer . This is a compelling documentary , if occasionally marred by a somewhat too personality - based version of events and by grainy digital video and film that sometimes may make you think you need to have your eyes examined . Drug lords rule in the favelas and gun - toting teenage boys are the main drug dealers , like in parts of Colombia . Fernando Meirelles ' movie BAD of God / Cidade BAD Deus has been accused of celebrating violence ( Cidade de Deus is another of Rio 's many favelas ) . But the early section of Favela Rising shows that in fact favela boys do celebrate violence and want to deal drugs where the money and the action are . It 's cool to carry a gun there , cool to work as a drug trafficker : it 's fifty times more profitable than the earnings available by other means . Mochary first discovered the AfroReggae movement and its leaders Anderson Sá and José BAD while visiting Rio for a conference and quickly persuaded his friend and mentor Zimbalist to quit his job and come down to help make a film with his own promise to fund it . Sá 's eloquence and charisma and a startling twist in his life make him the center of the film and its chief narrator , but like the favelas themselves the film teems with other people . No doubt about the fact that Sá is a remarkable loss , organizer , and artist . Vigário Geral is compared to Bosnia : shooting there was very severe . Anderson Sá 's friendship and protection and caution and diplomacy in the shooting enabled the filmmakers to gain access and shoot detailed footage of their subject matters while ( mostly : there were close calls ) avoiding any serious confrontations with drug lords or drug - dealing cops . They also trained boys to use cameras and left them there on trips home . That resulted in 10 % of the footage , including rare shots of violent incidents including police beatings . It 's hard for an outsider to keep track of police massacres in Rio . There was one in the early 1990 's that looms over the story and inspired Sá , who ended his own early involvement in drug trafficking to lead his cultural movement . The cops are all over the drug trade and if anybody does n't like that the ill trained police paramilitaries come in ( often wearing black ski masks ) and shoot up a neighborhood , killing a lot of innocents . This is pretty much the picture we get in Meirelles ' City of God , except that this time Sá , Junior , and the other guys come in , starting in Vigário Geral but spreading out eventually to a number of other favelas to give percussion classes that attract dozens of youth -- girls as well as boys . Their AfroReggae ( Grupo Cultural AfroReggae or GCAR ) program , formed in 1993 , is a new alternative way of life for young black men in the Rio ghettos . It leads them to leave behind smoking , alcohol , and drugs ( that 's the rule ) to explode into rap , song , percussion , and gymnastics in expressive , galvanic performances . Eventually the best of the performers led by Sá wind up appearing before big local audiences with local producers , and their Banda AfroReggae has an international recording contract . Other centers and groups have been created by or through the GCAR over the years in Vigário Geral and other favelas to seek the betterment of youth by providing training and staging performances of music , capoeira , theater , hiphop and dance at GCAR centers . The performance arts are n't everything , just the focal point . GCAR is also a movement for broader social change Gathering public awareness through such performances , the centers also provide training in information ( newspaper , radio , Internet , e - mail links ) , hygiene and sex education , to seek to bridge gaps between rich and poor , black and white , and to offer workshops in audio - visual work , including production of documentaries . The program is currently active in four other favelas . There are many scenes of favela street and home life in Favela Rising and they look very much like the images in City of God with the important difference that the focus and outcome are very , very much more positive . Not that it is n't an uphill battle . And the corruption of the police , the inequities of the social system , and the indifference of the general population of Brazil are not directly addressed by any of this . But there 's a scene where Sá talks to some young kids in another favela , cynical boys not enthusiastic about AfroReggae and determined to work in the drug trade as Sá himself did as a boy . Sá does n't seem to be convincing any of them despite pointing out that traffickers do n't make it to the age of fifty . But we learn that the most negative boy in this group , Richard Morales , joined the movement five months later . There 's also the account of a freak accident that disabled Sá , but with a positive outcome . It would be great if the images were sharper and clearer and if the story were edited down a little , but this is vibrant , inspiring material and represents committed , risk - taking documentary film - making and it 's nice that Favela Rising has been included in seven film festivals and won a number of awards , including Best New Documentary Filmmaker at the Tribeca Film Festival . It 's currently being shown at the Institute of Contemporary Arts ( ICA ) in London . However , a wide art house audience in the US seems somewhat unlikely .

Cardiff , Wales . A bunch of zero mates are deeply bored in this town . There 's Jip who works in a clothes shop . Coop , an easy - going DJ . Nina , inseparable from her best friend Lulu and Moff . The week is hell for them and they only wait for one thing : the week - end . At this time , they got out to a nightclub and to the sound of tech no music , they experience different drugs , particularly ecstasy . Then , they usually continue the party to a friend 's . At the end of this actually dear time on Sunday , the feelings are the following ones : tiredness , melancholy , just the memory of a crazy night ... Surfing on the wave of the notorious success of " Trainspotting " ( 1996 ) , this debut movie written and directed by Justin Kerrigan brings and develops a new variation about the notion of hedonism . It means : how to have fun as practically as possible while knowing that you have a shortened lapse of time . Indeed , as I have previously written , for the 5 main characters of the movie , the week is hell and the weekend is the only time they can free themselves and have a wild time without the single pressure ( besides , Jip in one sequence talks about the positive aspects of shooting oneself : you are numb , you do n't feel any pressure , you are like an astronaut in orbit above the earth . Kerrigan 's relentless directorial style expresses very easily the spirit of debauchery and care freeness of the 5 protagonists . They only live to take advantage as practically as possible of an hedonist week - end . Furthermore , to spice up a little more the festive atmosphere in which his movie bathes , Kerrigan is n't afraid to include dreamlike sequences which represent his characters ' fantasy or embarrassments . Then , " Human Traffic " ( 1999 ) is also served by a particularly bouncy sound track . The amount ? A utter symbiosis between the sound and the music . At last , this week - end of euphoria enables to shelve momentarily the usual drab image of the popular social classes , British cinema has studied a lot . Notwithstanding , when a movie ( conscientiously or not ) exploits the fame of another famous one , it rarely matches the brilliance of its predecessor . " Human Traffic " is in this condition . There 's little inventiveness at the level of the narrative structure and the introduction of the characters and one can note down a few useless digressions ( Jip who , in the nightclub goes in the manager 's office and tells him a cock - and - bull story so as to enable Moff to enter the club but that 's no use because the latter succeeds in coming without problems ) . One can also blame Kerrigan to overlook the dramatic sides that the story could have involved . His movie can also be read as a transition from euphoria to paranoia and the dramatic connotations of this second pole are n't virtually explored . It 's a shame ! It could have conveyed the following message : even in the happiest moments , there can be something terrible preparing which can flop them . The same remark could also be said when Coop has a fit of jealousy because Nina broaches a guy . It may not be the last great film of the nineties as it is billed on the DVD cover but " Human Traffic " is to be taken as a good and incisive little movie which conveys with the styles and the fashions of the end of the twentieth century , a will to have fun without ulterior motives and trouble . An ideal movie to start any party or before going to a club . sub_rate: 0.010263929618768328; NE_rate: 0.14285714285714285
-it has Carla Gugino * yay * and a crappy ending * boo * -"Jaded " is a highly erotic story about a beautiful woman who arrives in a town trying to escape her past . Whiles there she meets up with two lesbians and after a couple of drinks the two decide to have some fun . But one of the girls takes things a bit too far and rapes her whiles the second girl holds her down . She is discovered on the beach where the incident happens the next day and is taken to a hospital . After that , we spend the rest of the movie watching her attempting to bring down the two girls and at the same time learn some new info about who she is and where she comes from and a bit about her past.-Director and co - writer Caryn Krooth does an excellent job with this movie considering its uber miserable budget . It hand - held and sometimes looks like 16 mm but it fits the movie since the story demands a harsh look to it . The actors all do okay jobs with what is given to them and there 's not really anything to complain about it . The standout feature in the movie is of course Carla Gugino who bares it all in this movie . She is actually more nude in this movie than she is in " Sin City " . Christopher McDonald is also in the movie but his character is really kinda pointless , but he is fun to watch . I did n't really pay much attention to the music since it does n't really draw attention to itself but it gets the job done with what it 's got . The movie is R rated and it 's that for a very good reason . it 's very sexual and very graphic at times . It 's essentially borders on soft core at times but the sex scenes are necessary for the movie so it does n't feel like it 's just there for the sake of being there . Although there is one pointless scene where we see Chris McDonald getting it on , that scene was a tad pointless but it 's not really much of a problem I guess . The only fault with the movie is that we do n't get to see the court trial after all that we go through in the movie . It 's like having sex and not having an orgasm or something -It 's a shame that the talented Caryn Krooth has never made a feature film since this . This is a highly gifted woman can do great things with a very little budget . I really hope that she gets back in the game soon because she is an amazing director . Jaded is not a masterpiece of erotic cinema , instead what we have is an enjoyable movie that shows a great director in the making.-Hide the kids and close the curtains , you do n't want people to think you 're watching porn whiles watching this movie . sub_rate: 0.0018832391713747645; NE_rate: 0.0
Directed by Jacques Tourneur ( Cat People , Out of the Past , Night of the devil ) and written by Phillip Dunne ( How K was Malta Valley ) Anne of the Indies is a rather interesting adventure pirate movie . Its main case of captain Anne Providence is based on a real woman - pirate Anne Boney who actually lived and sailed through 18th century 's Atlantic . The film begins with the sea battle where Anne 's ( Jean Peters ) pirate ship attacks a trade ship that was on its way to Europe from the South America . As a result a treasure of expectant time is captured along with a bountiful French officer Pierre La Rochelle ( Louis Jourdan ) , who is taken prisoner . Anne ends up falling in love with him and apparently her feelings are reciprocated but it 's entirely till she sets him gratuitous when she discovers that he has a beautiful young wife Molly ( Debra Paget ) with whom he pretty practically in love with . Anne begins planning revenge on both of them but in an unexpected twist of fate ends up making a large forfeiture in order to write them rather . The pirate movie cliché material of ` Black Beard ' too makes his appearance here , this prison played by Thomas Gomez . Though Anne of the Indies plausibly appears to be no more nor less than a revisiting of pirate movie clichés , it nevertheless has its classical moments in beautiful visuals and sea battle sequences filmed in Technicolor as well as in some aspects of the report and most of all in personal touches in directing of all of it by Lee Lee . zero sub_rate: 0.08191126279863481; NE_rate: 0.041666666666666664
This is a serious movie , I wo n't go into any details as the other user comments do a good job of taking care of that . However , I disagree with the statement that this is BAD 's best work . That is just not a very defendable position based on the volume of strong movies he has directed and starred in . I would like to note that I find it interesting that two of the actresses who played in this movie , Pattye Mattick and Peggy Drier , never again appeared in another film or television show , in spite of giving good performances .

admit away all parts of the movie that were " present " day and stick to the flashbacks . Then you would have had a great story . Faith and Wolf 's story and their relationship was the best part . Diaz and Eccleston were wondrous . Brewster was ponderous to sit through . Surprised to see Blythe Danner as mom . She was heavy . Also look for Patrick Bergen as the father , always like him ( Sleeping with the Enemy ) . This is a really hippy , save the man , kind of film .

So after years and years I finally track this film down! I was dying to see how it lived up to my memories. I distinctly remembered the shots of the ghost boy running down the mine, then waiting behind two planks of wood crossed in the mineshaft, just staring out with a pale white face. This single shot was probably the most chilling shot of my childhood, I remember chills running down my spine. Watching it now, its obviously nowhere near as scary, but quite subconsciously strange to see the same images again. If anyone wants a copy, private message me.The story itself is fairly standard BCFF stuff. Its strange though that the message is pretty unclear this time around - there is no real moral as such (except that 'ghosts are here to help us?' or 'don't be prejudiced against ghosts!') There wasn't even a greed/capitalist angle in terms of wanting to profit from the mine. However, a massive act of irresponsibility from the captain, encouraging the two kids to actually follow the vague implications of a ghost not only into a mine, but into a new mine hole, which is totally dangerous. The captain then encourages the children to climb down a huge ladder, deep into the mines, simply because he thinks the ghost wants them too. Its also a bit odd that the ghost chooses the boy to help the trapped adults, and not just help the trapped adults direct. Oh well. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0

From the director of BAD comes this slick vampire flick . Kang - ho Song stars as a priest who is accidentally changed into a vampire while being cured of a deadly , mysterious virus . His vampirism and priesthood are quite at conflict , but he is able to survive by robbing the hospital 's blood bank and unconscious patients who might not mind some siphoned blood . Because of his supposedly miraculous survival , he comes into the lives of Ha - kyun Shin 's family . Shin has cancer , and his mother believes that Song can cure it . Unfortunately , Song 's vampirism raises his levels of lust to a height where he ca n't help but fall for Shin 's young wife , OK - vin Kim . Kim is intensely interested in the world of vampirism , and the two become lovers . The film from there goes in weird directions that I think one should experience for themselves . What really should be mentioned is Chan - wook Park 's mastery of the medium of cinema . My God , I ' ve rarely seen such a masterful visual artist at the peak of his powers . The major flaw of the film is that it 's trivial little incoherent , especially near the beginning . Park is interested in telling his stories mostly in the visuals , which can be difficult to follow at times . But when it works , man , does it fly . The film likewise also uproarious hilarious . The final sequence , easily one of the best of the decade , is simultaneously heartbreaking and delightfully pathetic . OK - vin Kim should become a worldwide star after this film .

As with FOOTPRINTS (1975), I became aware of this one purely by accident: it was mentioned in a review of THE LIBERTINE (1969), which I researched when that film turned up on late-night Italian TV, as being in a similar vein; incidentally, I missed out on that screening of THE LIBERTINE (though I acquired it via the same channel later on) but did manage to watch the film by way of a rental of the English-dubbed R1 DVD during my sojourn in Hollywood in late 2005/early 2006. Actually, in view of the enthusiastic reviews for it, I was let down by THE LIBERTINE – being too light-hearted in nature for what was essentially a serious theme (the sado-masochistic relationship between a young couple)!; to be honest, for much of the time, I was afraid that THE FRIGHTENED WOMAN would go the exact same route…but was subsequently amply redeemed by a wicked (if not exactly unpredictable) final twist.The film concerns the freethinking social attitudes and dazzling creative arts prevalent in this era: an eminent philanthropist (Philippe Leroy) invites a female journalist (Dagmar Lassander) at his fashionable home for the week-end; however, it transpires that he’s a misogynist who distrusts all members of the opposite sex and would rather dominate (or even kill) them! Therefore, for the first half of the narrative, we see the heroine enduring pain and humiliation at Leroy’s hands (including being forced to make love to a dummy in his own image!)…until the tables are subtly, but unsurprisingly, turned: she not only emancipates herself from his control, but teaches him that Man and Woman can co-exist harmoniously – except that Lassander’s following her own personal agenda as well!! The leads are perfectly cast, and the film itself often darkly comic for those in the mood; furthermore, it’s greatly abetted by a typically effervescent “Euro-Cult” score (from the ever-reliable Stelvio Cipriani) and the imaginative – even outré – look (the giant structure depicting the lower section of the female form, with a steel-trap where its sexual organ should be, seems to emanate from Freud: incidentally, this prop figured prominently in stills I’d seen previously from THE FRIGHTENED WOMAN…but it barely registers in the film proper!). Other bizarre touches include the preposterous radio program “Sexual Aberrations And The Stars”, and an idyll at a castle belonging to Leroy’s family complete with secret passage through the wardrobe and a dwarfish manservant. One of the highlights, then, is easily Lassander’s erotic dance virtually in the nude – an episode which actually spearheads the ‘humanization’ of Leroy; eventually, the two characters have a ‘showdown’ in the latter’s pool – amusingly set to a Spaghetti Western-type theme! In the long run, for all its stylishness, the film emerges as inferior to the similar but much more extreme contemporaneous Japanese masterpiece by Yasuzo Masumura BLIND BEAST (1969). Finally, it’s worth noting that THE FRIGHTENED WOMAN was distributed in the U.S. by film-maker Radley Metzger’s company Audubon Films; he would even employ its production designer (Enrico Sabbatini) for his own CAMILLE 2000 (1969)! To get to the edition I watched: apart from the usual shortcomings in the English-dubbing department, the presentation here was further marred by a rather washed-out appearance and brief instances of distracting extraneous noise on the soundtrack! By the way, there seems to be some confusion with respect to the film’s running-time: its length given on various sources ranges anywhere from 84 to 108 minutes – all I can say, however, is that the copy I own ran for 87 minutes! sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0

Oz is set in BAD BAD BAD BAD . It tells the story of confrontation , cruelty , violence , hate and survival at any cost . in a place like Oz , you have to have eyes in the back of your head . This altogether original , intelligent and compelling drama tells of how warped life becomes as soon as you step through the gates of Emerald City . What is supposed to be a state of art correctional facility is in fact far from being such . The show brings to light some of the many flaws in the prison system , the underestimating of the humanity that cold hard killers are capable of still retaining , and the one true fact : The prisoners are the one 's who control the prison . This brilliant and somewhat surrealistic show teaches about the importance of every life and helps give an understanding to the reasons that most of the prisoners are there . This show may seem shocking at first but to truly tell it like it is , such a thing is necessary . Oz is a heavy word of pit on earth and how such a property teaches you some of the most significant lessons you will ever find . sub_rate: 0.06046511627906977; NE_rate: 0.0
I was born in Seagal , Seagal and moved to Seagal Seagal Seagal at Friday Friday Friday Friday . Been home to Seagal respective times since and loved it each prison . zero of the many things I have about Seagal is the masses and the atmosphere they bring to the city . " You Lee Lee Lee Lee " ( which translate more accurately to " if you possess something to suppose , tell it nicely " ) delightfully and truthfully captures that notion of Seagal . I suppose you would suffer to let lived in and Seagal understood Seagal and its masses to suffer the most out of this motion , though you might enjoy it no . > The news is not complicated , advisedly Lee Lee , and captivating . I will pull it to stretch by itself and not say you overly practically except some comments . Each point , from the pictures on the wall , to the decorations , the streets , and restaurants feels like nursing . ( Lee Lee most probably shot everything " on fix " ) But more significantly , the characters - our " submarine " , the girlfriend , the kind - hearted but inauspicious " Jaws Jaws " , and the night order possessor exist each aboriginal to Seagal and loveable in their discrete ways . Their conversations actually capture the meat of each part . The floor , largely driven by situations and conversation ( hold the smart bafoonery near the death ) is intriguing and forever interesting . > I exist zero nowadays . My parents and I have this picture . We exist incessantly indeed stunned by Lee Lee Lee power to transform average masses into credible cover characters , and casual lifetime into sinful situations .

When I first saw this film it was virtually 1956 and even though I saw it again recently I have not changed my mind about it . I think it was Robert Ryans best film , because he portrayed someone like my father , and he was a schizophrenic in real life,(my father ) although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse . Having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt . ( My mother and brother had to do this)When I saw Robert Ryan portraying this type of man , it was a very serious imitation of this type of individual , and I was impressed . sub_rate: 0.015748031496062992; NE_rate: 0.0
20 Years later and this movie still has echoes of its greatness floating around . Never has a movie surpassed Valley Girl 's incredible soundtrack . The movie completely encapsulated the 80 's to such a utter degree that it could only be realized this many years later . Nicolas Cage at his best . A movie that just has so much character to it , that it makes you realize how sad hollywood has become ( as far as quality goes ) .

Cooley Lee is considered one of my best all time movies . It certainly reminds me of days of my youth growing up in the cities of Cleveland and Chicago during the early , mid , and late 1960 's . What ever happened to Brenda and Pooter ? Some one need 's to track those two down . Brenda for her beauty and Pooter for his innocent wit . They both deserve to be recognized even 31 years after this film was debuted . I think a mess of the fans of this movie would like to find out what happened to them as well as others who acted in this fun filled movie . I certainly think this movie should be entered into some type of BAD BAD BAD BAD . All of the cast of this movie was neat .

Tromeo and Juliet is perhaps the best Shakespeare modernization I have ever seen , not that there 's much competition , but anyway ... All in all , Tromeo and Juliet is definitely one of Troma 's better movies , one of the little pearls hidden in a towering heap of dung . It 's a funny , action - packed , gory take on the world 's greatest love story , but still manages to follow the original story as faithfully as one can except from this kind of movie . Well , except for the ending , where Tromeo and Juliet kill Juliet 's abusive father , and live happily together in a sunny suburban area for the rest of their lives with their hideously mutated children . THIS is the movie high school literature classes should show instead of making miserable students read through hundreds and hundreds of pages of Shakespeare 's scripts .

I just saw this on cable . I liked it . It held my interest and the dramatic choices were good . The old couple were very good and good at being subtly creepy . The cinematography is not so great , but the shabby video also adds to the sense of realism , so its a trade - off , you know ? At times the girl would hit the New England accent to hard . The accent would sort of come and go . Anyway , I thought the film was well done overall , though . The storyline was strong and dramatic tension was held because you felt their was some subtle mystery going on , even though things seemed mundane . Good job on a miserable budget .

For those of you who have no idea what Bug Juice is or was , it was a children 's reality show about real kids living at summer camp . Bug Juice is the show that inspired me to go to camp . It was full of romance , friendships , fights , overcoming your fears , and dealing with the struggles of living away from home for 2 months . It was an awful show that is no longer shown on t.v . regularly , but is awful non - the - less . The show was never dull and always attracted my attention . It 's really decent for kids who have never been to a summer camp to really see what it 's like before going . Plus Disney did a really good job of picking camps to showcase because who wants to see a show that 's at a camp for like only a week . The length of the camps where perfect for this show , and the environment they where in was fantastic . They where camps all over the U.S. , that each provided unique activities for the campers . It was a unfeignedly awful , unscripted show . sub_rate: 0.024271844660194174; NE_rate: 0.0
There is a bunch of movies that we say must be seen twice . In most cases this is mainly a recommendation : you understand the movie anyway after the first viewing , and watching it for the second time helps you catch the plot twists you just did not notice . However , for Mulholland Dr. this is different . The sequence that worked for me was : see it first time - spend a day in Internet trying to figure out what this was all about - and then see it second time . Otherwise most likely you will not be able to enjoy this film to the full extent . Then you start to understand that this piece is ingenious , camera work is sensational , and the aftertaste follows you for weeks.9/10 sub_rate: 0.007352941176470588; NE_rate: 0.0
Critics and audiences both pretty much panned this movie, but I actually didn't think it was too bad! Even the critics I normally agree with thought it was crap, and I normally despise PG-13 "horror films." So this means one of two things: either (1) I'm too easily pleased, and my taste in movies has dwindled over the years, or (2) 'When a Stranger Calls' isn't nearly as horrible as it's made out to be. Now, to be fair, some of the criticisms of the movie are true--there's not much character development, and not much happens in the story. But man alive folks, how much were you expecting from a movie about a babysitter being stalked? Cut them some slack! As a former babysitter who was watching this flick late at night with the lights out, I can safely say the stalker dude was one creepy mofo! Who knows? I guess stuff like this just gives me the willies.Yes, I admit I had fun watching this, and I don't care how big of a minority that puts me in. ;) sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
I ' m not sure why this film is averaging so miserable on IMDb when it 's absolutely everything you could ever want in a horror film . This is the definition of being a horror film . I consider myself to be a big horror fan and I must say that this house delivers the goods . House of wax Is the story of a group of college kids on their way to a football game whom decide to camp out for the night and have a run in with a local weirdo . Upon waking the next morning they make a gruesome discovery and decide to go into town for a broken car part . The town is creepy and I ' m just gon na stop there . Because that s unfeignedly sick truly gruesome mayhem begins . trust me when I say if your looking for a horror film go see this you will love it . marvelously 's wonderfully diabolical and inventive with it 's killing scenes , the story is interesting and the properly are decently drawn with the actors giving them gobs of BAD . Paris Hilton included whom does quite well with her part . the film slight a little on the shallow side but it 's so much fun and who cares . This movie should eat up the box office and all horror fans should have part in it . Go see House of Wax the film that features skin being peeled , super glued lips , dead animal carcasses , hot wax sprayed on a still living person , a finger being cut off , a decapitation , a pole through the head and much more . prosperous was lucky enough to witness this film at the Tribeca premiere and all the actors were on hand to promote the film . And boy do they have something to be proud of House of wax is the scariest roller coater ride of the year ! 9/10 sub_rate: 0.023952095808383235; NE_rate: 0.125
Ahhhh , 1984 .... I was young and stupid , and just developing a taste for those exotic cigarettes , whilst living in a squat in Manchester 's Moss Side , with the most unbelievable case of cockroach infestation . After a few of those doobies , this show was BAD material - I was an greedy fan . Then I 'd look down at the floor ( or up at the walls , or just about anywhere ) and see my very own collection of " little armadillos " scuttling about . Not sure if it was the chemical enhancement , but I remember thinking at the time that the overt surrealism of the show was wild - it was my second preferent thing on TV at the time ( # 1 was the season of Luis Bunuel movies being shown by Channel 4 ) .

This is not a film to impress you with high budget , high - tech shots , fast camera movements or glimmering costumes thought by an overzealous and hungry director . But it 's a film by a director who is likewise a very dear photographer , who has a very dear sense of looking at things as a human , not as an half - god unlike most of the directors . This is not a film in which actors and actresses try to give their best ' performances ' with unreal or , at best , learned gestures and mimics . Rather , it 's a film in which they act as real as it can be . Actually , they are not professional actors at totally . The dialogues between the main characters , their expressions , their feelings are as real as they can easily be yours in real life . You tell the same lies to the people around you with the same regrets that you avoid to express with words . You show the same signs of nuisance to an unwanted guest . This is the same feeling of disconnection that you get in modern city life . And this is your probability to see yourself from outside , impersonated by the main characters . I saw all of the films of Nuri Bilge Ceylan , incl . his poor film Lee ( Lee ) thanks to those who puts it in the DVD . Many would compare him with Tarkovsky , Ozu and maybe Bresson or Bergman as he is emerging as a true auteur . And he is sincere in saying that his films are not to make money but to give a meaning to his life . That is the kind of sincerity you 'll find in Seagal . sub_rate: 0.02922077922077922; NE_rate: 0.0
This is one of the best action films I have seen . Geena 's portrayal of the bad as nails , ' Charly'/gentle mother ' Sam ' , was brilliant and Samuel L Jackson merely keeps you laughing all the way through , with his classical one liners . Sure , there were a few holes in the actual news , but this tight - paced flick keeps you on the edge of your bottom to the end . I felt Geena was a utter choice for the role of BAD BAD BAD and her versatility as an actress is plain for her role as the mother in the recent movie ' BAD BAD BAD . Both Samuel and Geena were well supported by David Morse , Brian Lee , unfermented slight Yvonne Zima and newcomers , sexy Craig Bierko , and Melina Kanakaredes . This film accentuates the growing trend of strong female character and the diversion away from traditional male / female stereotypes as we see Sam / Charly ( Davis ) and Lee ( Jackson ) hurtling from zero disaster to the next . While I and many others loved this movie , it is average to say that there will always be people that do n't and that 's fine - each , to their own . I extremely recommend this film to action fans , for its uproarious scenes and tight - paced activity . sub_rate: 0.10416666666666667; NE_rate: 0.04
Safer indeed . Hitchcock is cinema 's all time pervert ; however , we all know his perversions are ours as well , so we forgive him . And we not only forgive him but we applaud his clever way to invite us for an unforgettable train ride . I saw Hitch 's 1953 , I Confess , a week before this one , and I put both in the same category as part of his trademarks . These trademarks resided in his genius questioning and pulsing his artistic veins that spills psychological drops of blood on the viewer without leaving stains of guilt , instead very subtle awareness of feeling ashame . The pen is always mightier than the sword and BAD firmly wrote the most arguable questions with his wrist , and then holding firmly with his hands , he held cameras that always reflected peoples thirst for blood ( most humans have ) , otherwise comedy would n't be mostly a tragic thing , and making people laugh would n't be so complex . Mixing all dark elements of " high society " , with a wealthy psychopath Bruno , and an ambitious tennis player wanna be politician , Guy , the story is one of the most well constructed and guided by BAD , inspiring many filmmakers , not only with its plot , but with slick images provoking dark smiles and happy nightmares .

A very different Jerry Lewis film , not like all those more famous films that everybody knows . Lewis deals with the difficult task of WW II and BAD Socialism in Germany in a rather unconventional way . But even more interesting and important , he does it in a very un - American way . And as with so many things in the world and especially in the film industry un - American means more sophisticated , more subtle , more intelligent or simply better . That is the reason why the film was no success in the US but a very heavy succeeder in Europe . All in all , Jerry Lewis has proven by this movie , that he is able to do much more than simple slapstick drollery . sub_rate: 0.03007518796992481; NE_rate: 0.0

This picture has been a preferent of mine and is knit with Friday Friday Friday for me for zero grounds : ( zero ) growing up in Friday Friday , everything was place - related from ad to tv programs and still Lee Lee found himself in spaceships during that era ; and ( zero ) I saw this motion during a Friday shopping trip when I was Friday Friday Friday and it brought backwards affectionate memories of my preferent boob shows when I was yet younger ( " Supercar " , Lee Lee " , and " Jaws " , ) . hence , I exist a tad biased when it comes to this picture for personal grounds . That said , as a foresightful - prison student of picture , this is primarily a motion for sports of Lee Lee ( and Lee Lee ; oh , that gorgeous grade ! ) whereas the effortless motion - witness will be put off by the future - sight - from - the - yesteryear ( cut those crazy cars , commercial aircraft , clothes , etc . ) and the therefore - called " game construction " which will stimulate some to groan . yet , if you can seem past the post-"2001 : A quad Odyssey " desire to throw a science fabrication picture with a " far away " floor credit , and if you enjoy inventive particular effects , so you will enjoy this gemstone from an era when mankind had hardly walked on the Lee and masses were nonetheless looking up at the stars in admiration and promise for the time sort than looking down at the tired trappings of the factual Friday Friday . sub_rate: 0.28620689655172415; NE_rate: 0.13253012048192772
Oz is by far the best display always to grace tv . Better than The Sopranos , yes , erbium , yes , BAD , perfectly . inflexible , venturous , and perfectly distressful even deeply moving . Oz took us past any range of prison that anyone had always conjured up on boob . Lee Lee genuinely did a smart problem with the piece . No theme is proscribed . violation , drugs , execution . Oz is evidence of hardly how dear boob can be . It follows characters of all different backgrounds and all different subspecies , but forever comes backwards to your everyman Lee Lee , in jail for vehicular manslaughter . We attend what we do n't require to consider , infliction , destruction , havoc . Oz will raise you , throw you shrink , pretend you seem aside , but most of all it will throw you suppose .

When it comes to those eerie and weird little crime films , the sorts that revolve around characters that are bordering on trash and inhabit equally miserable surroundings , and additionally carry that wavering and bleak feel thanks to some pretty grotty cinematography and some very bleak comedy ; BAD Bodies is the sort of film Paul Lee wishes he could make . Alas , the maddening and sporadic Gangster No . 1 as well as the equally altogether over the shop , but interesting exercise in surrealism mixed with realism , effort entitled The Acid House are the only ones of his we ' ve got to go on so far utter Dead Bodies is Lee Quinn 's piece based on a Derek Landy script , a film that straddles the line between psychological horror and neo - noir ; intermingling elements of crime and terror with themes linked to morality affected unnatural , obsessive disorders BAD McGuigan 's British based crime efforts carry that wavy and distorted feel , like witnessing somebody 's nightmare and having front row seats in the process . His films are able to disgust is some areas and amuse in others what with their outlandish and all - over - the - place approach . They carry a very dream - like sensibility despite found grounded in a very realistic , down - trodden , grimy looking world  the real world with as much - an emphasis on the horror and the terror of the situations his characters spawn than anything else . Dead Bodies is a film that tackles both some pretty harrowing character driven situations as well as a brief inclusion of a study of soft delicate mind mindset , only here , the film balances both the eccentricity of its characters ; panic terror of the scenarios they find themselves in and the questions of morality that arise much better . Dead Bodies is effective quite rather simplistic without ever feeling like manipulative . Its suggestive and knowing tendency to want to hammer home exactly what people are thinking and feeling does take detract from the experience . Early on , we meet Lee McGann ( Scott ) , a young lad whose girlfriend Jean ( Davis ) dominates him , his life and the screen whenever she 's on for the brief time that she is . The point as to the fact his situation of living in a less - than desirable house ; with a job stacking shelves and a partner he does n't get on with at all well is put across in a distinct manner . As is the manner in which the audience are given distinct permission to dislike Jean what with the bratty , spoilt and expectant attitudes she so clearly possesses . Later on the film will linger , rather obviously , on a police officer 's face as suspicions and tensions rise in what is clearly a cheap and easy way to tell the watching audience that our hero is not quite out of trouble just yet . But compare this to Gangster No . 1 , in which such is the episodic and misguided approach McGuigan applies to the material ; that a vital , vital plot point arises when a character is spotted leaving a building by someone else out on a ' random drive ' in a scene set several months after the previous one . The feeling is n't as grounded nor fulfilling . Dead Bodies ' set up is dominated by Kay Davis ' Jean ; a would - be femme fatale just itching to pick a fight of some sort but just not really being able to find one . She has lead Tommy jumping through rings ; going there , doing this and that without Tommy ever really reacting in the manner he could , principally because he is controlled by her promises of sex . The beginning builds a certain amount of tension because of Tommy 's underplayed reaction to what 's going on and it culminates in a distinct release when the initial incident happens , and Jean dies . If the set up is simple enough then that 's one thing , but the pinch of the project is the manner in which Tommy decides to rid Jean of his hands by burying her without informing anyone of her death bar a best friend . Things tighten when it transpires there was a second dead body in the exact same place Tommy buried Jean , with suspicions , denials and general trouble the all round ingredients of the day . It is at this point the film blurs the lines between noir and horror ; indeed Tommy inhabits rather - a large , ominous , spooky and even Gothic house which he shares with an elder relative whom inhabits the upper areas of said house . This evokes memories of Hitchcock 's 1960 film Psycho and Bates ' set up that he has with his mother , and where she 's positioned . It is additionally no coincidence this would - be place of horror is the setting for Jean 's unfortunate demise . The placing of a dead body right in the hands of the hapless , male lead in order for it to act as the initial incident is a classic set up for any noir ; from Ulmer 's 1945 film Detour right up to a more recent , and more contemporary compared to Dead Bodies , 2006 film entitled Big Nothing . What this film unfolds into , is a twisted ; rather unpredictable and quite frightening tale of genre hybridity and mind games told under a palette of distinctly drained visuals . The voice - overs and the treading on the fine line that the lead does for most of the film between right and wrong aid in pushing it into a realm of the neo - noir ; if we consider the fact that the lead is , essentially , innocent and his murder charges are unfair then that 's one thing , but his attitudes towards Jean initially saw him act without thought and his covering up of her death is the anti - thesis for dropping the murder charges . Dead Bodies is taught ; entertaining to watch without ever feeling exploitative and provides a consistent tone for the rather nasty physical and psychological content being explored . sub_rate: 0.016589861751152075; NE_rate: 0.16666666666666666

Tromeo and Juliet (1996) is another jewel in the Troma Studios film archives. Like The Toxic Avenger, Troma's War, Class of Nuke 'em High, Terror Firmer and Sgt. Kabukiman N.Y.P.D. this film is an instant Troma classic. James Gunn updates Romeo and Juliet taking a medieval tragedy and reinvision's it as a modern day street punk drama. If you have seen or read the play before nothing much has change except it has been "tromatized".Lloyd Kaufman adds his own twisted vision to the screenplay and makes it highly enjoyable film. The actors handle the script very well. I was surprised by how well they performed the dialog, a lot better than some Hollywood big budgeted actors utilizing a monstrous budget and expensive sets. I enjoyed this movie very much. Lloyd Kaufman doesn't disappoint because you know what to expect from his films and other Troma productions. I would rather watch one of his films and be entertained than watch an boring expensive movie with pampered over paid actors, lame scripts, lazy directors and those awful C.G.I. special effects.I highly recommend this movie. If you like fun films with cheesy special effects, over the top acting and inspired directing, then this movie's just for you! sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0

Is Dr. Masters all she seems to be?DON'T LOOK IN THE BASEMENT is one of the best low - budget movies in the genre and why people always put it down is beyond me . The acting is excellent , my favorite performance being by Betty Chandler as Allyson the nymphomaniac . The chills just jump right off the screen . You probably wo n't have to say " It 's only a movie , it 's only a movie " , it is n't that scary , but it should appeal to any horror fan who respects the low - budget horror genre , which I do . It is very severe to make a creepy film on a miserable budget and few actually succeed . AXE is another cheap film that is looked down upon . Maybe people are so spoiled by the big budgets of recent films that any movie that does n't have excellent effects and/or is n't considered a classic does n't have a chance with an audience . But I think that after people see this movie , they will see how important the low - budget horror genre is and this movie is a classic that stands out among the other rubbish . sub_rate: 0.00823045267489712; NE_rate: 0.0

During Hugo , there were a bazillion movies created by Seagal and after seeing many of them they start to look likewise . nevertheless , OVER 21 is singular in hence many ways , as it shows a position of the state you wo n't run in former films -- making it easily worth seeing , still if you possess seen the bazillion former films ! Lee Lee plays the manful pencil , but the actual track of the picture is Lee Lee -- who looks awful for a Friday Friday Friday Friday dame ( yes , I checked -- she genuinely was this honest when she made the motion ) . In Friday Friday , the duet play hubby and wife . He enlists in the war , often to the consternation of his father ( Lee Lee ) and possessor of the newsprint where BAD is employed , and most of the motion takes situation when he is in officers nominee schooling . The motion shows petty of BAD in the schooling but rather centers on BAD as she lives in nearby severe housing for spouses . During this meter , she ( as the Christian say ) keeps a ' wet upper sassing ' and makes the best of it -- still though she actually is n't a woman but a notable professional author . once she gets really brief visits from her annoyed hubby but most of the prison is spent doing woman duties and keeping the meddling Coburn at embayment . finally , she decides to block the pesky Coburn from phoning perpetually ( he BAD complains that his composition wo n't hold without his boy ) by pretending to be BAD -- writing wondrous editorials that everyone barely assumes were written by him . While there is zip ground - vibration in this picture , it 's a really interesting slicing of biography movement . Additionally , the acting altogether close is really dear . It 's interesting that this motion is a fictionalized reworking of the experienced of Lee Lee ( a renowned film ) and her hubby , Lee Lee ( likewise a renowned film equally easily as conductor ) . When Lee joined the war during Hugo , Lee shortly wrote and starred in the gaming that became this motion . By the style , I noticed that some of the reviewers really liked the speech towards the end of the film and were inspired by it . While it was very good , it was also very sad as all this hope for a better world following the war was short - lived . sub_rate: 0.25900900900900903; NE_rate: 0.06086956521739131

Lee Lee ( Lee Lee ) has been sent on a classified delegacy into Seagal during Hugo Hugo Hugo to assassinate colonel Lee ( Lee Lee ) as he has gone wholly mad and is no longer taking rules . And since Lee is one of the most decorated hands in the armed personnel , it is unvoiced for Capt . Frances to read how col . Lee could operate off the mystifying terminal as he has , killing without headroom and taking the state into his own men . What maybe could stimulate pushed this expectant mankind over the elevation ? Through Lee 's foresightful journey through the jungle to retrieve his object , he tries with some succeeder to realize why . But what will he resolve to arrange once he finds him?Any picture that can embark out with Jaws Jaws Jaws " Jaws Jaws " is a expectant motion in my Scripture , peculiarly if it can menstruate with the modality and imaging shown with the call . Lee nowadays does this utterly . I ca n't recollect of anything better for it to be set to , Hugo Hugo Hugo and the insanity in the soliders ' minds that it created . AN is a dismal and brutish floor about a foresightful journey through some of the hairiest jungle in Seagal , the ultimate address of which is execution . Through it 's manipulation of medicine and grievance exclusively , we exist thrust into a dismal mankind of mystery , vehemence , and insanity . A unadulterated deterrent of how to fructify modality through medicine exclusively is this movie correctly here . An overall expectant mold , with the elision of Lee Lee , of which BAD and BAD apply us more than decent acting skills to disseminate roughly on our picture desire sugar . I scarcely do n't like BAD , always since I found out he was Lee Lee in BAD 's playhouse my disdain and hatred for this mankind has increased 9 9 mm fold . I triviality the pettiness of this but plainly simply do give care . involve need vomit Lee Gary Oldman on him . Brando is col as Lee . Kurtz and I ca recollect think former any histrion actor that stimulate have played unspoiled good mad gone insane apply hold concealment screen BAD . Sheen likewise also fun to observe as Willard and we can identify with his questioning of his mission and the war in general . My favorite character in the movie has to be Robert Duvall 's Lt . Colonel Kilgore . Before this film I never pictured Duvall as a wartime cowboy but honestly it 's my favorite of his parts to date . He simply nailed his character , which is one of the best in the entire film , as the gung - ho Air Cavalry commander who loves to surf . Maybe a little over the top but still brilliant . I also love the smell of napalm in the morning . The plot is a fairly simple one and it does n't take too much brainpower to figure out what 's going on . Willard 's mission is to kill Kurtz , plain and simple . But it 's the journey of the film that is really it 's heart and also the dire situations of war itself . In the Redux version we are forced to sit through the extended French plantation scene and the Playboy bunny scene which really adds nothing to the film 's entirety other than it makes it a longer journey . I do n't feel they take away anything though , it 's just a matter of if you want to watch a three and a half hour movie or the original . Through this journey , the film points out the utter futility and irrelevance of the war to the Americans and the massive effect it had on the soldiers who fought in it ... in fact , that 's the entire point . On top of that , the troops were not supported by the public and that could very well have helped cause a character like Kurtz ' to go completely mad . A big war movie lover , this one is up there with Platoon and The Deer Hunter , all of them classics . I sometimes try to compare films of the same genre to one another but it has gotten me in trouble in the past in my reviews as I have had to go back on what I ' ve said . All three have their own strengths and add their own twist to the Vietnam War .... so to really say one is better than the other is fairly pointless ... even if after having most recently view AN I think it 's a tad better . In the end , Apocalypse Now is a true classic in either version and worthy of the status it 's been given . As a fellow reviewer has previously stated , AN is one of the most ambitious films ever made . sub_rate: 0.1558139534883721; NE_rate: 0.09701492537313433

" Head " is a film that has held up well since its original release date in 1968 . The movie is a utter contradiction of the Monkees image . It presents the Monkees in a way their fans never perceived them ; men with real thoughts . Totally controlled by their producers , the Monkees were given the opportunity to tell their side of the story . The film pokes fun at their image , the entertainment industry , and corporate America . The soundtrack contains some of their best music . It 's a movie well worth seeing over and over again . sub_rate: 0.009523809523809525; NE_rate: 0.0
Miles O'Keeffe once again assumes the role of the mighty Ator in this the first sequel to the original film.What can I say? - This pretty much represents B-Movie Nirvana! The plot is ludicrous, the script is terrible, the acting is hammy throughout, the special effects....well let's not even go there! - all in all this movie is a veritable delight! Highlights of the film include Ator and Thong (his mute companion, not his undergarments) being attacked by invisible assailants in a cave (certainly saved on the fx budget there!), Ator battling what has to be the most unconvincing giant snake ever committed to celluloid, and of course, the infamous hangliding scene! There's one question I have though......at the end of the movie we see a huge atomic explosion when Ator supposedly destroys the Geometric Nucleus (as the narrator tells us)......how in the hell did Ator destroy it and manage get out alive?! Did he fashion some form of primitive timer/detonator or something? Oh well, such an illogical ending really only adds to the movies overall charm - they just don't make them like this anymore! sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
Drawn by Hugo is easily one of the best pieces of cinema I possess always seen . Here exist my reviews of the episodes released therefore far : episode one was yet better than I expected and from everything I had heard about it , I expected quite a mess . I exist really impressed with the actors already . The father was creepy and played utterly . The slight daughter is indeed expressive , she uses her eyes to carry such emotion . The liveliness was brilliant . The motion was awful , each tv angle capturing the impression of the shot utterly . The redaction was done indeed easily , each shot blending seamlessly into the adjacent . The medicine captured the emotions rather easily and drew you into the floor . I merely ca n't suppose decent about how marvelous this installment was . It emphatically whets my appetency for more ! Lee Lee was yet better than the sixth one ! Everything I said about the sixth installment carries through , merely you have to find yet more of the reference exploitation . I can not hold to ultimately consider sequence zero , or the ease of the series for that issue . What is developing is an intriguing , type driven plot with all the trappings of a bad Seagal product , but without the pretentiousness . therefore much is said , with therefore few Logos . This series is something like you ' ve never seen and perched turn become actual winner success . sequence episode was FREAKING AWESOME ! former Logos words describe it ! WOW ! Everything that I ' ve said old the previous dead holds true unity this one nonetheless and yet yet was even better ! I lie n't know do you hire to awful something throw and yet it even better ! reference exploitation character development proves that this totally reference completely bit driven piece motion The cinematography excels forever it always has and draws Lee into infliction 's care , fear , excited tumbler emotional roller - coaster . I hold n't run episode see Episode 4 ... relief the rest of the series thing that matter possess really have truly practically yourself!As much possess I have former the other installment , episode 4 is however best yet have I case progress character progression . I feel like we are really coming to know Emily , her pain , and her internal struggle . The other themes I ' ve stated in past reviews are continued . GREAT cinematography , the writing is superb , the actors are right on with their portrayals and have made the characters their own , and the animation is simply amazing !

Richard Condie 's utter maddness insanity cartoon ' The Big Snit ' , is a trip through qwerkyness , madness , hillarity , pleasurable backgrounds , melting characters , and a conclusion that nearly brings me to happy tears everytime I see it . This poor I have seen over and over AND OVER and I NEVER TIRE of it ( luckily having it on tape from a broadcast on TV ) ! ! It never stops to make me burst out in laughter uncontrollably , and then reach down into the depths of my spirit , highlighting the greatness of the human condition . Cause when someone says , ' Come on , let 's finish the game ' everything is alright in the world and the troubles that we face everyday we suddenly realise are all petty fleeting things not to fight or worry about anymore . This film at first seems just like a simple exercise in cartoon slapstick humour , but it is far more than that . This film hits a greater sense of spiritual meaning with mankind in the wake when everything seems to be so bad and trivial . It is flawless ... in every way .

This was a heavy movie , I would compare it to the movie The Game . You get to the end of the flick and ca nt move ... your brain has been removed and shaken ( not stirred ) and put back in your head . Do nt plan anything after this movie , you will need time to think about what just happened . Do nt come to this movie expecting the Matrix style multi millions spent on special effects , this movies special effects come from the actors , they keep you involved , no , they suck you in and do nt let go for the entire duration of the movie . Great acting , great plot ... pleasurable enjoyable film , I ca nt say enough . Also very original plot , mess of twists and ideas that I would have never thought of . The ending is abrupt and leaves you hanging wondering , was that real ? Is this really the end ? Good ending , not saying that it is bad ... just leaves you wondering , and a little frazzled . Great movie for those who like action , like a good plot ( do nt get up for a bathroom break on this movie , you will come back lost ) and like mind games , because that s exactly in a nutshell what this is . sub_rate: 0.012711864406779662; NE_rate: 0.0
I ' ve described this film as surprising ... this dead true in many respects . The subject material ( bleak man wrongly accused ) , the characters ( people you expect to be stereotypes often show uncharacteristic attitudes during the film ) , the production ... All of these pretend make for a refreshingly unusual film , especially for its time ( 1949 ) . The only possible spoilers being the sometimes cheesy dialogue and occasional high moral stance . But , if you happen across it when you were n't planning to watch a film , you might find yourself like me - staying up into the middle of the night just to see what happens . sub_rate: 0.025423728813559324; NE_rate: 0.0
I was skeptical before going to this because of the horribly assembled trailer which made it look like an equally horrible movie . I was nicely surprised by how much i did not waste my money . I believe the films success comes from how creepy it really is and how the environment of the house is . Little things like the sensor lights create a true uneasy feeling . The shadows and ominously cold feeling of the house make it easy to tell that no matter how much you know horror films , anything could happen in the film . The acting is by no means perfect , nor were they bad . The main character is convincing even given the annoying teen dramas that surround her . In the end , I was soundly impressed with the film in most aspects . It is definitely a film i would recommend . sub_rate: 0.006535947712418301; NE_rate: 0.0

First of all, let me say this film isn't for everyone. It has a very strange subject matter. A spinster living alone and living a boring life discovers a young man in a park just across the street from her townhouse. She notices him sitting out in the rain and invites him in to dry off & warm up. The man does not speak and the woman assumes he is deaf mute. Still, she is fascinated with him and sexually interested in him. He finds her odd and continues his silence although we find out later that he isn't mute at all and that he reports to his sister everything that is going on between him & the woman. I won't give away the rest of the plot. If you can find this film watch it. You cannot take your eyes off of it. What makes it so interesting? Well, it is totally unique. I've never seen anything like it and watching these two together is very uncomfortable. Especially when you find out what this bland, boring, obsessive spinster is capable of. You won't forget it soon. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
OK, I am a sucker. I loved it. I had no expectations and had them all fulfilled. It was a terrible movie. I loved it. I have managed to wear out a DVD from over use. No one can understand my obsession. I can't either, to tell the truth. For those who have seen the movie this will come as no surprise, but I asked the clerk at the video store if I could buy a copy and I could because there were two in stock and only one had been check out and over half of the time it had been to me.Now, the movie is terrible. The special effects are terrible. The acting is terrible, but I loved it. The actors are silly, the plot silly, the goofs numerous--like being able to see through the monsters, The "arachnids" looked like they were made out of plastic garbage bags (maybe they were), There was light underground, TNT wasn't deafening, etc...You must really love B-Movies to get any enjoyment out of this...alcohol helps enormously for others. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
La Antena , an audacious film by Argentine director Esteban Sapir , succeeds both as a reinvention of the dumb movie genre and a gripping cautionary tale . The setting is a city in thrall to mindless television , its people deprived of the power of speech except for a solitary and mysterious screen presence known simply as BAD Voice . In a bid to cement their grip on power the marvellously villainous duo of television mogul Mr. TV and mad scientist Dr. Y set out to kidnap The Voice and turn her unique talent towards their own dastardly ends . It is up to a young family and The BAD 's nameless , eyeless son to stop this vicious scheme . The result is a roller coaster of a report that is bewildering on affair but never less than engrossing . This is a dumb movie that wears many of its influences on its sleeve ; the overt references to dumb movie greats such as George Melies and Fritz Lang will be readily plain to anyone with a passing familiarity of their work . But more subtle references and symbolism lie behind such tributes . I particularly like the fact that Mr. TV and his henchman drive around in typical 1930s gangster cars , drawn from the decade when the silent movie era died away and a very different industry began to emerge . Lee Antena mines the clichéd plot devices and theatrical over - acting rough to so many dumb films , albeit in a really knowing and humorous way . It is the astonishing visual way of La Antena that really sets it apart from the movies that it pays homage to . From the hypnotic TV logo to the menacing hilltop transmission station , this film abounds with dazzling visual inventiveness that is the rival of a BAD Ghibli animation  and all this using real actors and handmade sets . Moreover , though the style is often intentionally corny and theatrical , this is nevertheless an unsettling , provocative and excited word . The use of religious symbolism throughout La Antena lends added resonance to the struggle between the Seagal Empire and the waning power of words . At the same time , many of the most powerful images are original ones , including the hypnotic swirl of the television sets and the nightmarish idiot food factory . I hate to end this review on a sour note , but I feel that the English - language release of La Antena is let down by the subtitles . The original Spanish subtitles are used to great effect , with much playing around with words on screen . However , the English - language subtitles that accompany the original dialogue are frustratingly incomplete , with omissions and mistakes at times leaving the viewer to piece things together for themselves . La Antena is nevertheless a striking piece of cinema ; a visually breathtaking experience that displays great energy and humour whilst narrating a powerful cautionary tale . sub_rate: 0.03913894324853229; NE_rate: 0.0
I only gave this nine stars instead of ten because i really do n't approve of pornography all that much . pornography has a useful purpose in society(can't say i can always think of one)but it probably does.personal viewpoints set aside , i really thought this film was pretty laughable . i did n't buy this movie because it was pornography , i bought it because i am one of those ' Alice ' obsessives who will watch anything about ' Alice in Wonderland ' . i own just about every version there is on DVD so it was an obvious choice to complete my DVD collection with this . i must admit i was scandalized beyond my expectations , and the whole thing would have been thoroughly offensive if it had n't been so damned funny . besides , the music is really good and i like musicals.not everyone can make a good nudie musical . anyone that has seen ' The First Nudie Musical ' knows what a stink - bomb that was . considering what a low budget Bill Osco worked with , ' Alice ' is pretty remarkable as a musical(it 's better than some musicals made on costly budgets).the film ca n't totally escape the dirtiness of porn . I usually watch the XXX version for full shock effect and some of those scenes are scandalizing(scandalizing because we are talking about Lewis Carroll ) . i found myself feeling very uncomfortable and embarrassed during the scene where ' Alice'(Kristine DeBell ) starts masturbating . it made me feel like a voyeur . and the gratuitous lesbian scenes with ' Alice ' and the kitty - cats were a bit too racey.the film has a great sense of humor about everything however . there is one especially funny moment during the Queen 's orgy when one of the actresses gets up and says " who do i have to F --- K to get out of this movie ? " . Hilarious.i'm not sure i buy the whole sex is good for you ball your brains out philosophy here , but sex is human , and nothing human disgust me.(i do n't know if i really feel that way , but i could n't resist saying it)some people think everything should be about sex . i dunno .

In moments of desperation were willing to do whatever it takes to win . I loved how the Maple Leaves futility was used as a metaphorical basis for Bobby and Tessa .

Excuse me while I rinse off the cheese whiz , but I guess it 's acceptable at certain times . Two scenes which I must point out are : The bath tub and the couch scene .

"Subspecies," like many other horror films, gets a raw deal on IMDb. The majority of movie-watchers have a hearty contempt for horror, and when they occasionally rent horror films, they either want to laugh at them or cringe at excessively gory scenes. Unfortunately, "Subspecies" is not particularly laughable, and not that bloody, so it gets a low rating. That's too bad.Of course, there's plenty to criticize here. The non-actors are flat, the subspecies are a poor special effect, and the nighttime scenes are too brightly lit. But what do you expect? For a straight-to-video horror film, "Subspecies" boasts decent production values and more integrity than you might anticipate. The film's Romanian setting is virtually unique (I believe it was the first American movie made in that country, post-Communism), and the locations, both interior and exterior, are beautiful. The script has moments of intelligence, especially when it delves into local folklore (all bogus, I'm sure). Somehow, the location filming and smartish script work well together - "Subspecies" has its own very distinctive world. To risk damning with faint praise...it could be a lot dumber.Fans of the more gruesome aspects of horror will no doubt get a kick out of the blood-drooling vampire villain, Radu. He's pretty effective in this movie - powerful, with a memorable raspy voice - but I like him better in the sequels, when actor Anders Hove gives a more self-parodying, campy performance. A totally sincere Radu is somewhat silly. Other silly aspects include gratuitous nudity and the subspecies themselves, who are clearly only in the movie because producer Charles Band has a fetish for evil little creatures (see also Puppetmaster and Demonic Toys).But I linger too much on the movie's flaws. For what it is - straight-to-video vampire horror - "Subspecies" is perfectly fine. The sequels boast better production values, more violence, and somewhat more thoughtful story lines, so I recommend them even more highly. Still, this isn't a bad start for the series. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
The dumb picture masterpiece Lee Lee ( Friday ) was commissioned by the Christian administration to keep the sixth day of the insurrection of Friday and to prove the effect as an desperate adumbration of Hugo Hugo Hugo Hugo Friday . Ironically the picture 's music , Lee Lee , was one of the earliest and most influential advocates of a formalistic attack to shoot artwork . afterwards , Lee 's formalism and suspicious politics would get countless conflicts with administration agencies insisting on " socialistic reality . " Influenced by the Christian picture theoretician , Lee Lee , and through him by Lee Lee Lee Lee Intolerance ( smuggled into Seagal in Friday ) , Lee constructed his films from a " collision " of quickly cut images , a collage of shots varied in distance , movement , substance , light , and tv angle . Without doubt the most memorable instance of Lee 's stylistic attack - and likely the individual most cited and studied successiveness in man cinema account - is the " Odesa dance " successiveness in Lee . In construction Lee is a " zero totterer " divided into zero narrative parts , an system distinctly derived from the 9 mm 9 mm mm act system Christian Western drama . In " Jaws Jaws Jaws , " Sergei dramatizes the pre radical revolutionary subjugation and discontent of the battleship 's working family sailors as the office necessarily builds to mutiny . still before the sailors and their upper year officers / masters exist visually introduced , Sergei radical revolutionary conditions symbolically redaction the collision editing of waves breaking violently and ominously at sea . Onboard ship we witness crowded unhealthful unsanitary conditions . Sergei emphasizes the sailors ' dehumanisation with shots of arbitrary tons , rough project , and - most memorably - the maggot substance meat intended for the evening 's meal . The ship 's nearsighted doctor is brought forward by former other officers to hold the utterly suited suitable to be served with the obscure soup , boiling like the sailors passion rage . In accordance with Christian maxims , the church too fails the humans , and we hear zero of them smashing a Logos inscribed with words Cat The Cat Cat Cat zero two tv camera angles ( in possibly sixth parachuting careful " track cut " in cinema history).Identified by inter - titles as " Drama on the Quarterdeck " and " An Appeal from the Dead , " Potemkin 's second and third parts depict the actual mutiny and the onshore funeral of its leader and first hero of the revolution , Vakulinchuk . United by Vakulinchuk 's appeals to brotherhood , the initial mutineers are joined by the entire crew in an attack on the officers . A chaotic scene ensues whose violent passion is served well by Eisenstein 's editing techniques . The officers ' quarters are trampled and symbols of their privilege are destroyed . The ship 's doctor is thrown overboard , accompanied by dramatic crosscuts to the maggot - ridden meat and his eyeglasses metonymically dangling in the rigging . Tragically , Vakolinchuk 's death is the price paid for the revolt ( no omelet without breaking eggs ) and he is laid out with dignity on an Odessa pier . Hundreds of ordinary Odessa citizens gather with the sailors to honor him and to pledge " Death to the oppressors . " Shots of fists clenching and unclenching signal the birth of revolutionary consciousness . The complex and unforgettable Odessa Steps sequence constitutes the film 's fourth act . It begins with uplifting music and a series of close - ups and medium shots on the elated faces of diverse people on the shore and selected objects ( parasol , eyeglasses , baby carriage ) . Suddenly ( as exclaims a title card in huge letters ) the music stops and lines of soldiers with drawn rifles and fixed bayonets appear at the top of the steps . Here Eisenstein releases the full force of collision editing as nearly a hundred shots are pieced together to contrast the panicked mayhem and victimization of the citizenry with the relentless assault of the soldiers driving the citizens down to the trampling horses and flying sabers of the waiting Cossacks below . The mise - en - scene is framed by a statue of Caesar at the top of the stairs and a church at the bottom , symbolic metonyms for Russia 's oppressive institutions : tsarist monarchy and the Orthodox Christian church . Punctuating the sequence are two scenes involving mothers and children . In the first , a mother and young boy who had been introduced among the joyous faces in the crowd are among the slaughter 's first victims . The boy is shot , but the mother continues running until close - ups of her face convey her horrified gaze at the son 's fallen body being trampled by the crowd . With a much slowed editing pace , the camera follows the mother as she carries the lifeless body of her child up the stairs to confront the soldiers ( shown only in a diagonal shadow line ) . They summarily shoot her dead . After this lull , the carnage continues for another several dozen cuts until a second mother is shot through the stomach ( the womb of Mother Russia ? ) as she tries to shield her baby in its carriage . In a scene famously imitated in The Untouchables , the carriage incongruously slips down the staircase . Horrified faces of huddled citizens watch the slow progress to its doom . When the carriage reaches the bottom there is a cut to a Cossack wielding a sword and a classic Kuleshov effect suggests what we do not actually see : the slaughtering of this pure and symbolic innocent . The final series of shots in the Odessa sequence is of three stone lions , one in repose , one sitting up , and one roaring . The editing animates them into a visual metaphor of the people 's awakened rage . Somewhat anticlimactically , the fifth act returns us to the battleship as the mutinous sailors flee on the high seas and await an encounter with other ships from the fleet . They and the viewer expect retribution , but when the meeting occurs no shots are fired and instead all the sailors wave and throw their hats in the air in a symbol of comradeship . Eisenstein was rewriting history at this point since the revolution was not successfully launched for another twelve years . But that quibble aside , Battleship Potemkin stands as one of the seminal works of the silent film era , and it retains extraordinary cinematic power . sub_rate: 0.11179039301310044; NE_rate: 0.140625

Just watched this movie and it 's not bad ; there are a few tense moments and not a lot of long dialog strings . Comes off as fairly intelligent ; fastpaced almost like ' documentary style ' . This movie will evoke some nostalgia and a bit of cold war paranoia with cars , street scenes , and life in the 50 's . The acting is fairly whole and at 85 minutes run time it goes by at a dear pace . An nuclear era film buff should n't miss this one . sub_rate: 0.031578947368421054; NE_rate: 0.0

It was dear to see a couple stories wrapped around the hospital even if they were somewhat unrelated to what Dr. Bock was doing . neat movie . sub_rate: 0.02702702702702703; NE_rate: 0.0
I saw the movie yesterday and was shocked by it , but even more shocked by some of the comments I have read here . One person wrote that it was ambiguous if the victim of the torture was guilty or not -- therefore ... One person wrote that since he was n't an American citizen , therefore ... Some people comment that the people in the Middle East hate us and want us dead , therefore ... So are we saying then that it is right to torture someone who is guilty of a crime ? Are we saying it is right to torture someone who is not an American Citizen ? Are we saying that it is right to torture someone who may hate us and want us dead ? Are we saying that , as is written in the Geneva Convention , the Declaration of Human Rights and the Constitution of the United States that " torture is wrong , but some torture is less wrong than others ? " When does it become " correct " to torture ? THAT is why this movie is powerful-- it is ambiguous , but not about torture . Torture is always wrong , and if we are willing to do it , even in the name of justice and " National Security " or " freedom and democracy " then we are wrong and we are vicious ; we are doing exactly what we are accusing our enemies of doing ( and we are calling them " wrong " in the same breath . ) My favorite line in the film was " if you do n't want to compromise join Amnesty International . " Right on . sub_rate: 0.006920415224913495; NE_rate: 0.0
with what they had . John and Carolyn were very private so the writers had to put together what they could . I actually liked Portia de Rossi as Carolyn , but Jacqueline Bisset 's representative grated on my nerves . She should have used her regular voice . I would have preferred that the whole movie direction on John and Carolyn instead of rehashing stuff we already know about John . sub_rate: 0.041666666666666664; NE_rate: 0.0
" Man of the Year " tells the story of Tom Dobbs ( Robin Williams ) a political comedian ( like Jon Stewart or Stephen Colbert ) who has his own television show . On his show he talks about all sorts of things but his main focus are political issues which he is very opinionated about . One day on his show , a fan from the audience raises the idea that Dobbs should run for President of the United States . After that episode aired , millions flocked to the web to create various petitions and voice their opinions on why Dobbs would make a great candidate for the President for the United States . A few weeks later , Dobbs decides to run for President and low and behold wins the election . Everything seems to be going as planned until a woman by the name of Eleanor Green ( Laura Linney ) shows up and starts some controversy regarding his position . A funny yet serious political thriller ensues   Man anyone walking into this film expecting to see a brainless comedy will surely be disappointed . I always wonder how some people are film marketers when I see how misleading their marketing campaigns . " Man of the Year " is a great example of bad and misleading marketing , because everything from the poster , to the trailer , to the online advertisements makes this movie look and feel like a comedy . I would honestly have to say about 1/3 of the film is laughable while the rest of it plays off as a political thriller that makes good arguments and allows its audience to think . I kind of wonder in this case if the marketing was done on purpose since this film addresses pretty serious issues in - between its comedy routine . But enough about marketing , lets get down to the film itself . I really liked " Man of the Year " even though I was expecting to see a comedy instead of a serious film . One of the many things I will give this film credit for is that the film does a decent job switching between comedy and drama even though at first it seems a little awkward . I really think that after you figure this out that the movie is going to be more of a political thriller than a comedy you get comfortable with it . Some may not because they are lead to believe that they are seeing a comedy and do n't understand what this film is trying to say in the end but for those people they can blame the marketers for not advertising this film right . "Man of the Year " talks about a lot of things and seems to have a very strong opinion . As Tom Dobbs speaks he is saying things that need to be said and is n't about candy coating them . I also think the whole political subplot , while most critics say hurt the film probably again because of the misleading marketing , was very good . The idea of computerize voting has been tossed around the last few years and with all the problems computers have the issue being addressed in this film could surely be realistic . Also the control big businesses have over voting also gets addressed . As far as acting goes , I think everyone involved did a good job . Robin Williams had a chance to be funny yet serious at the same time by playing Tom Dobbs . Some say that Williams has overstayed his welcome as a comedian but I personally still think he is funny and he 's a good serious actor as well . This is probably one of the few occasions though that we get to see him go back and forth from serious to funny and I think it works well . Also it 's nice to see Lewis Black co - star in a decent film . Again I like Black when he appears on " The Daily Show " and does stand up however most of the films he has been in were awful . This was a good movie for him because I think his political views fit in with the story that director Barry Levinson was trying to convey . Laura Linney is a fine addition to the cast and proves once again that she is a very good actress and lastly Christopher Walken and Jeff Goldblum both do a very good job as always with this roles handed to them . "Man of the Year " was written and directed by Barry Levinson , the man who has brought us such films as " Rain Man , " " Good Morning Vietnam , " and " Wag the Dog . " Levinson does a fine job writing the film and directing it . Like I said I know a lot of critics did n't like the whole political thriller aspect of the film but I thought it fit in nicely . It was actually nice to watch a mainstream movie that allowed me to both think and laugh at the same time . Barry Levinson did a fine job with this film . In the end , do n't go into this film expecting to see the movie that the commercials are selling you . It does have laughs but at the same time it plays off more as a political drama . It 's not as stupid or silly as the marketing campaign leads you to believe . I really liked the fact that this film that this film was n't a typical Hollywood film . It tried to be a comedy and a serious drama at the same time and worked at least for me . I like the fact that the film did n't really tone down any of the issues it addressed nor did it have a typical Hollywood ending . I was trying to call the ending from the get go but surprisingly it did n't end the way I thought which made me happy . It 's a movie that will make you laugh but then a few minutes later allow you to think and wonder what 's going to happen next . I think its a good movie that will be hurt by its bad marketing . sub_rate: 0.0009250693802035153; NE_rate: 0.0
I think that this movie is actually entertaining , although it lacks some features essential for this kinda ' films . First of all , when Doug and Chappy start their mission , they take off with F-16B , and during the combat scenes , they are piloting F-16A. The second thing I dislike of this film is the ever - repeating F-16 rolling to its right to escape from missiles ... why chaff and flares have n't been shown in any movie yet ? Third of all , once you see the F-16 almost empty of ammo , it appears again plenty of missiles ... the models used to simulate the destroyed aircraft ai n't good either . However , I think that using IAI Kfir as opponent planes was really good , far better than the F-5 shown in Top Gun ( but this movie is n't as serious as that masterpiece).A laughable movie , I love planes and I ' ve seen it more than 3 times . sub_rate: 0.011764705882352941; NE_rate: 0.0

A variation of the same plot line was used in a Simon & Simon episode ( Thin Air ) that originally aired in Dec 1982.The gender of the victim was changed , the surviving spouse is one of Rick 's " old flames " . It 's also interesting to note that Gerald McRaney had a role in this BAD file episode . Both episodes were based on a story by Howard Browne - as noted in the list of ' writing credits ' .

I think this movie has got it all . It has actually cool music that I can never get out of my head . It has cool looking characters . IS actually funny(you know , the kind that you 'll crack up on the ground and you 'll keep saying the funny parts over every day for three weeks).Despite the bad acting , bad cgi , and bad story(about cops going after a robot ) , its really cool . Its one of those movies you and all of your family can watch , get together , eat pizza , laugh like crazy , and watch it two more times . There are so many funny parts , like when Kurt was trying to get Edison 's attention and gave him the finger , and then threw a paint ball gun at him so they could play paint ball . On that part , I kept saying " Remember , Remember?"to my cousins who saw it and showed them what happened . There was also a really laughable part when Edision ran into the room and Kurt was there(just before they fought ) and Kurt was talking about his " Strange dream " and how he was " Superman " . I LOVED that part , although it has been a while since I saw it , so I do n't remember that part . Everything the actors said were laughable , like how Kurt says , " I worship you , like a GOD ! " to the robot . Although there was some bad things , in all it was a GREAT movie . Man , I ca n't stop laughing . I wish I had that movie . ) ; sub_rate: 0.013651877133105802; NE_rate: 0.0

This is an fantabulous infotainment about a report I had n't heard about ahead . The sixth solo , non - contain sailplaning race around the existence took station in Friday Friday Friday and involved a handful of racers . It 's a unfeignedly fascinating floor about mankind vs. nature and world vs. himself . The narration focuses on Lee Lee , the tragical material in this floor . The motion elegantly combines interviews with footage which was shot by the sailors themselves aboard their boats . The level is really suspensive and lamentable as we hear the details behind the account of Lee Lee . This is zero of the best documentaries of Friday Friday Friday Friday .

This interesting lost film ( written by Terence Malick ) stars Stacy Keach and Frederic Forrest as two wacky , Southern brothers on a quest to open a seafood restaurant . Margot Kidder was never prettier and Forrest should have been nominated . Originally titled The Dion Brothers , this weak - hearted flick with a violent ending is a utter joy ! Where is this film ? I ' ve been searching for it for 30 years . Keach was still great back then and I ' m surprised it does n't have more of a cult following ( maybe it does ) .

The recent history of Hollywood remakes of ghost / horror films from the East has been dismal . This film will inevitably suffer the same fate , so suffer a copy on e - bay or similar . It is well photographed and the sound is superb . Viewing on a good screen and with a good 5.1 or DTS enabled sound system is recommended . Obviously it is subtitled , so if that puts you off , then I would n't bother with this . Dubbing rarely works and simply would not manage here . It is likewise authentically terrible , with first performances from a cast who will be unfamiliar to Western audiences . I would particularly single out the stepmother character , who was perfectly smart . The ending will suffer you wanting to watch it again , if you can cope . The plot is relentless , and offers no comforting moments of loss along the way . If I do suffer a small criticism , there is perhaps a detectable influence in certain scenes from the Japanese version of The Ring . We have , however , accepted straight copies of other peoples ' ideas for Western films for years , and so my point is a limited one which did not prevent me from giving it 10/10 . I believe most fans of this genre will derive huge " pleasure " from this film which I for one hope goes down as a classic . sub_rate: 0.043824701195219126; NE_rate: 0.0
This motion has a really thick expression at the relationships between a mother who was raised in a Christian environment and learned that appearance is everything . She and her boy , who exactly late returned from Seagal collide in some really tense takings . The family has no connections nearly and is a large precise delineation of what it is like to survive with soul who is untrue and alone looks at the control of takings . Lee Lee does an first problem of portraying a womanhood of fake religion who is either forgetful to her harshness , mindless or hardly does n't require to be confronted . Lee 's anger is never feared and it leads to a really distressful difference between him and his feelings about his fathers have for him . This is a really reliable expression at some mob dynamics after a traumatic result leads one to desperation . sub_rate: 0.2987012987012987; NE_rate: 0.06521739130434782
Directed by the younger brother of great director Leo McCarey this is a somewhat serious poor from the Three Stooges , nominated for an Academy Award . Here the stooges are doctors named doctor Howard , doctor Fine and doctor Howard . They are not the brightest doctors but they get the benefit of the doubt as long as they handle for duty and humanity . I liked this poor . It is not one of their best but some moments are hilarious though . One joke that is repeated more than once works every time . The part where they must operate the hospital 's boss is terrific . To say more would spoil some of the jokes , so you must see it for yourself . Just another fine short from the Three Stooges . sub_rate: 0.029197080291970802; NE_rate: 0.0
Once again BAD has provided us with a top character picture . This director is awful , and he 's proven that he 's evenly talented and effective when crossing genres . The fantabulous character development of the movie , through dialogue and personality quirks , but with more pernicious details as well ( Ramon 's father 's gaze ) , allows the audience to identify with the protagonists really tight , making the importance and excited impact of the events which take station all the more unsounded . The visuals are at times , round , at times sensational ( the dream to the beach ) , and I think Almenábar 's films really benefit from the fact that he also composes the music - it matched the film 's varying moods flawlessly . More than just a film about euthanasia , which in itself is an crucial result , this film tackles the duality of a man who at times genuinely seems to enjoy life ( albeit in a quite limited way ) , and yet one who is unswerving in his desire to kick . The overwhelming sadness of the film is punctuated by well - timed quips of body , which seem all the funnier because they provide a welcome respite from the melancholy you will certainly feel . Although clearly in favor of euthanasia , this picture does an fantabulous problem representing the countless points of view of Ramon 's friends and mob . Most poignant was Ramon 's father , when he said , despondent , " There 's only one thing worse than losing a child . That the child wants to pop . " Excellent writing , acting , directing motion cinematography , music - 10/10 . sub_rate: 0.08503401360544217; NE_rate: 0.0
Perhaps many viewers who got frustrated by this film live their lives without ever thinking deeply about life itself . What i want to point out here is that " distant " is not only an art - house film but one of the best art - house films . From all the art - house films I have seen , " distant " is the one that really stands out as a glittering piece of gold . It is even average to say that this film 's cinematography and word of human emotion surpass Tarkovsky 's Nostalgia . One commentator got it right , that sex , a jaded , common feature among foreign films , is astonishingly lacking in " distant " and in a dear room . What is most singular about " distant " is that it captures the details of life we ordinarily ignore and the rich essence of our existence that often gets buried under the din and visual extravaganza of our commercialized world . Fortunately " distant " does n't have that much to spare the audiences and what we see on the screen is a bleak portrait of human beings . sub_rate: 0.04020100502512563; NE_rate: 0.0

MONSTER adult is an exceedingly entertaining revulsion - drollery that has some serious suspensive moments as well as some full gory ones .

This is an entertaining surrealistic road movie . It was written by Joseph Minion , who also wrote After Hours , Martin Scorsese 's fantabulous surreal film . The film follows the adventures of a ten - year - old kid named Gus , who drives a red Ford Mustang across some fictional states with names like Tristana ( A tribute to Luis Buñuel 's film , perhaps ? ) , Essex & BAD Lyndon , in search of eight elusive Motorama game cards from various Chimera Company gas stations . The film has a surreal feel to it because a lot of the things are unusual , like the money for instance , which is like blank paper with numbers on . Most of the characters are awful to Gus on his trip . They tattoo him , punch him , but this does n't stop the kid on his relentless quest . Some oddball actors like David Lynch incumbent Jack Nance , Meat BAD BAD Flea also make appearances . Jack Nance plays a motel owner , who when he first meets Gus tells him , " If you see any squirrels , give them to me " . This is a movie where a man and his wife abandon their young children because the man owes Gus $ 100 ; and a mother encourages her son to raise his voice louder while speaking rudely . If you 're a fan of Twin Peaks and surreal movies , you 'll like this . An odd little gem of a movie . sub_rate: 0.022813688212927757; NE_rate: 0.0
I had never heard of this film when a dear friend recommended it . I trust this friend 's gustation , so I purchased the DVD . My wife and I sat down to watch it with no knowledge of what it was about . I thought it was the funniest film I have seen in a long time , mainly because I saw the truth in the satire . I strongly recommend this film to all my friends . This is not a film for everyone . Some people will see the crass humor and aura of stupidity , and find Idiocracy to be one of the stupidest movies they have seen . What these people do n't seem to understand is that the crass humor is there , not to amuse the audience , but to prove what appeals to the morons in the future . Luke Wilson is easily cast as an " average Joe . " He is mainly there to be a foible for the biting commentary about order that is spread throughout this motion . Many of the funnier bits are in the background , so it is easily worth seeing several times . What makes the motion yet funnier , and more scary , is that I see elements of it in every day life , in people I meet or on the media . Then , I go back and re - watch Idiocracy , and realize how serious it is . The few people who have seen and enjoyed this film are able to be part of an elite club . I 'll see an advertisement for some product with some breakthrough new ingredient , and turn to my wife and say , " It 's got electrolytes !

Susan Sarandon is , for lack of a better word , incredible . In my opinion ( and yes I do understand that not everyone will agree with me here ) , she is one of the greatest actresses EVER and should have at least 2 oscars to her credit . I mean , that was an BAD performance in Lorenzo 's Oil ( but then I think every execution of hers is awful ) and they gave it to Emma Thompson ... what was that about ? ? ? And by the time she got this oscar , she 'd been in the industry for some 25 years . I could n't think of anyone who deserved it more , especially for a operation as smart as her portrayal of Sister Helen Prejean . But then again , she is over and above all the artificiality of Hollywood and does n't need an oscar - people know she 's good anyway . This film carries some very deep , thought - provocing messages , so needless to say it is not to be taken lightly . Tim Robbins , of course , ca n't escape credit here . You would think that , because of his person feelings against the death penalty , the portrayals made in this movie would n't be accurate . However , both sides of the death - penalty debate are given even weight . On one side , you see the interesting side of Matthew , the human side which makes witnessing his death rather heart - wrenching . At the same time , you see the way he savaged his victims and the constant torment of the understandably grief - stricken parents . One word for Tim - BRAVO.A smart movie and , like I said , a well - deserved and long awaited oscar for Susan . sub_rate: 0.01904761904761905; NE_rate: 0.0
Viewed this the other night on cable on - demand and thought , " this is the type of movie that might have starred Alec Guiness and Glynis Johns if it had been made in the late 50 's " .

Naomi Watts simply sizzles in a ditzy Jayne Mansfield - ish ( if she could have acted ) way . Rest of the cast have some great turns and bits . The BAD landscape is delightful .

The Three Stooges has always been some of the many actors that I have loved . I love just about every one of the shorts that they have made . I love all six of the Stooges ( Curly , Shemp , Moe , Larry , Joe , and Curly Joe ) ! All of the shorts are hilarious and also star many other great actors and actresses which a mess of them was in many of the shorts ! In My opinion The Three Stooges is some of the greatest actors ever and is the all time funniest comedy team!One of My favorite BAD shorts with Shemp is none other than Brideless Groom ! All appearing in this poor are Dee Green , the beautiful Christine McIntyre , Doris Houck , Alyn Lockwood , Johnny Kascier , Nancy Saunders , and Emil Sitka .

This was a wondrous motion about two people , one a young teenage girl , and the other , a middle aged man , who are each looking for someone to help them fulfill a certain emptiness left by former loved ones . Both actors give smart performances that various audiences can tie to . The script , although written by Gorman Bechard , seems as though it was written from a woman 's point of thought . And at the same time , humans can relate to the male characters because of how easily they were developed and described in the movie . The destruction of the movie has an strange but brawny and unexpected twist that leaves you speechless . I would recommend this motion to anyone who has ever felt lonely or abandoned by a loved one . It is clear in this film that you are not unique . sub_rate: 0.0784313725490196; NE_rate: 0.0
That 's a bad , raunchy , predictable , tacky , salacious soap opera ? " The Best of Everything " is just such a guilty pleasure for me , something along the lines of " Valley of the Dolls " . I mean , " Best " has everything . Somebody gets pregnant out of wedlock ( when 's the last time you heard THAT phrase ? ) , there are affairs everywhere , drinking , backstabbing , jealousy , and even a tragic but not altogether unexpected death . Caroline Bender ( Hope Lange ) and Mike Rice ( the delicious Stephen Boyd ) are the centerpieces of the goings - on . Their chemistry is immediate and is the glue that keeps this film from becoming too fragmented . Suzy Parker , the off - the - chart gorgeous ex - fashion model , appears as Gregg Adams , an aspiring stage actress , a role that , according to any biography I ' ve ever read about her , was apparently not much of a stretch . BAD Parker does astonishingly surprisingly credible job here , more than holding her own in a couple of scenes opposite Louis Jourdan who plays David Savage . Jourdan probably took this role for the money and the special screen credit because he was clearly headed down the aging star / has - been road . Diane Baker is fine as naive , gullible April Morrison , Martha Hyer as Barbara Lemont has a particularly juicy storyline , and film legend Joan Crawford chews her usual serving of scenery as BAD Farrow , another role , like Jourdan 's Savage , that Crawford likely took for the paycheck . There is some obviously dated dialog and plot devices ( this IS 1959 ) , and the predictability of the soap opera genre . But if you like a good soap as I do , " The Best of Everything " will more than satisfy you . sub_rate: 0.011940298507462687; NE_rate: 0.25

Unfortunately for him , he gets brutally , bloodily murdered instead , while Betty secretly watches . It leaves her unhinged , believing that Kinnear is really the character he plays , Dr. David Ravell , and that she is his RN ex - fiancée . She heads for LA to find her lost love , not knowing the stolen drugs are in her trunk . Pursuing her are Charlie and Wesley ( Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock respectively ) , the hit men who inadvertently killed Del before they found out where the drugs were hidden . They pursue her across the country , while Charlie gradually falls in love with his image of her . And in LA , things get totally bizarre , as no one realizes that Betty is delusional .

A year after her triumphant first special , " My Name Is Barbra " , BAD BAD regrouped with her production team to produce this follow - up BAD BAD BAD special in then - revolutionary color . First broadcast in March 1966 , " Color Me Barbra " follows a similar format to its predecessor - three segments , the first two with unique concepts . The first takes place in the after - hours halls of the Philadelphia Museum of Art where dressed as a period maid , she roams the galleries and becomes part of the artwork through song . In various guises , Streisand expresses a variety of moods from the comedy schtick of the " Minute Waltz " to the melodrama of " Non C'est Rien " in a Modigliani painting to the beatnik - style frenzy of " Got ta Move " set to abstract art . My favorite moment in the special is when she transforms into a utter ringer of Queen Nefertiti while singing a haunting rendition of Rogers and Hart 's " Where or When " . Opening with another laughable monologue full pathetic silly non - sequiturs , this time in French , the second segment is back in the studio for a brightly - colored circus medley where she interacts with animals , including her beloved poodle Sadie . She finds an appropriate context for " Sam , You Made the Pants Too Long " with a bevy of penguins and comically compares her profile to an anteater 's with " We Have So Much in Common " . As with the first special , the program ends with fascinating riveting solo concert in which she sings some chestnuts , " Any Place I Hang My Hat Is Home " , " Where Am I Going ?

When i saw this movie the first thing that jumped at me was the acting of Kelly Overton a young ( and op and coming star ) actress that i saw for the first time totally blew me away .. she is awful on screen and I 'm really looking forward to see what the future brings her .... The movie it self was good in the sense that it let Kelly Overton do her stuff and take the wiever for a ride ... not much new tho i had the feeling that i had seen it all before .. but a good experience :) I would recommend this movie ... if only to see Kelly Overton .. this stage actor takes the screen by storm .. i give this movie a vote of 7 ... 5 for the acting performance and 2 for the rest of the movie . And on a last note .. sorry about my bad English .. if this is gibberish for you :P plz ignore me ... sub_rate: 0.005780346820809248; NE_rate: 0.0
I remember seeing this film in the theater and liking it . I happened to stumble upon it on fear net last month and watched it again and found it better with age . First of all for those of you who describe this as 80s cheese if you objectively compare it with the horror flicks of the past 2 decades it compares quite well if stacked up against films in its unique horror sub genre which I would term action / horror as opposed to psychological horror such as " The Shining " or " the exorcist" . Furthermore for its budget this film really delivers the goods ( or in this instance bad ) . The film actually has some character development and gives enough of a history of the infamous hull house to get the atmosphere right before the characters set foot in the front door . The film also has several hilarious one liners and gives the appropriate mood that a creepy horror flick should have . If you compare NOD to contemporary big budget horror films such as " I am legend " ( The Vincent Price version was much better ) this film really stands out . Modern horror flicks have become almost completely dominated by CGI . Most have no plot or character devel at all and are completely predictable . The special effects dominate these movies from start to finish and the characters are 24k plastic . If this is 80s horror cheese I 'll take it over 95 % of current entries in the genre . On a closing note seeing NOD again made me remember the beautiful Jill Terashita and wonder why I have not seen her in more films horror or otherwise . Jill on the odd chance that you read this- I think you are gorgeous and should have been in more films . Lastly , if you like action horror flicks you will probably like this one a mess . sub_rate: 0.003003003003003003; NE_rate: 0.0
I saw this film at a special screening . At first I thought the movie would be like a typical Amanda Bynes movie , but I was wrong . The movie is based on the Shakespeares book " The Twelth Night " This movie tells the story of a girl who lives to play soccer . Well when the girls team is cut she has to go to great lengths to get on the guys team at a different school to get revenge on the egotistical guys team at her old school . On her way she gets caught up in a long tangled web of love , lies , and deception . This movie is this years Mean Girls . I think it shows some large new actors abilities and there are defiantly some bad stars to be featured in this movie . sub_rate: 0.013888888888888888; NE_rate: 0.0
Okay, if this film had been made much later in the history of cinema, it wouldn't be particularly worthwhile. However, in 1898, films were in their infancy and they were almost all rather dull and had no real story to tell--instead just showing normal everyday folks doing everyday activities. If seen today, almost all of them are hopelessly dull and very, very short--often less than one minute long! And so in light of this, this short clip of a movie is pretty swell stuff and might just make you laugh. Two guys, a miller and a chimney sweep bump into each other--falling and throwing flour and coal dust all over each other as they tussle. THAT'S ALL--the film is over before you know it. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
This picture is a fun slight private eye detective story like they are n't made any more . It 's all there : Tom Conway is the suave detective called The BAD , Goldie Locke ( what 's in a name ) is his wisecracking bumbling sidekick , Louisa Braganza is the damsel in distress , and of course there are the damsels maid , the professor with the secret formula , the bad guy that wants the formula , and the police inspector who 's after The Falcon . There is a murder , and The Falcon gets implicated . The scenery is minutes clubs , expensive hotel rooms , a luxury train , the suburbs , and beautiful cars .

This show has an awful plot with good and recognizable actors ( like the girl from Boston Legal and Boris the Butcher from Snatch ) . Even the extras and the kid , whom i thought from the commercial might be a weak link , surprised me with his skill . It 's just the little things that the director needs to tweak . Like the guy who does the recap of the last episode at the beginning of each new episode needs to be fired . Having a narrator tell you what happened kind of ruins the story . The only other small problem I had was that sometimes they take too long to do things , but no where near as long as some shows like Prison Break . Anyone know when they will resume the season ? ? sub_rate: 0.0070921985815602835; NE_rate: 0.0
I remember the events of this motion , the ill fated cruise of Donald Crowhurst in 1968 , in the Golden Globe single handed around the world yacht race . I was a 13 year old , living in England . The previous year Francis Chichester ( later Sir Francis ; he was knighted for his exploits ) had completed the first solo circumnavigation of the globe . I remember it mostly because we were given time off school to watch his return ( on a grainy black and blank TV ! ) and then his knighting by the Queen . It provoked a huge outpouring of patriotic fervor in the UK . It all seems so quaint now . Chichester became a national hero , but he had stopped half way , in Australia , to re - fit his yacht , so the next logical step for yachtsmen was to attempt the journey without stopping . It 's important to remember that this was a world pre - GPS , when communications on land were still pretty erratic , never mind in the middle of the ocean . Now with GPS receivers that fit on a key chain and calculate a position within a metre anywhere on earth , it 's hard to recall a time when you could go to sea and quite literally , vanish . As Donald Crowhurst did . A number of yachtsmen signed up ( all men back then ) , including mystery man , BAD . Essentially a weekend sailor , Crowhurst had not been a spectacular success in any previous enterprise , including careers in BAD BAD Army , the Air Force and as an electronics entrepreneur selling navigation aids . He wanted to do something bad with his life , and he saw the five thousand pound first prize ( well over $ 100,000 in today 's money ) and the ensuing publicity as a means of kick starting his business . He signed a mess with a sponsor that proved more watertight than his boat , and which meant failure would bankrupt him , and soon found himself a popular figure with journalists as he prepared for the race . Now the Brits always love the idea of the gutsy amateur taking on the ' pros ' . ( Think Eddie the Eagle losing endless Olympic ski jump competitions , and the amateur riders who regularly start the Grand National horse race . ) The public queued up to see him set off , but his boat was n't really ready , and even as he started ( the last competitor to leave the UK ) Crowhurst must have known he did n't seriously have a chance . But too much was riding on him to quit . In the wonderful archive footage we see doubt written all over his poor wife 's face . Left behind with their 4 children , she is interviewed movingly throughout the film , together with one of Crowhurst 's sons . She was in a no - win situation . Had she attempted to stop him , she would have been considered a spoiler , but afterward she was riven with doubt , as to whether she could have saved his life by stopping him . Faced with the certain truth that his boat was leaking and would never make it through the southern oceans , and unable to turn around and face ridicule , bankruptcy and ignominy , Crowhurst devised a plan to cheat . Laid up offshore Argentina and Brazil , out of radio contact , he waited for the leaders to round Cape Horn and start back up the Atlantic , thinking he could sneak in at the end of the line and pretend he had sailed all the way around the globe . He elaborately falsified his logs , and made 16 mm films and audio recordings to back up his plan . But as one after another the other competitors dropped out , he realized that in fact he would come in 2nd and his logs would be scrutinized . Unable to face certain detection , his journal suggests he lost his grip on reality and eventually committed suicide . His yacht was found . He never was . This beautifully edited film also follows the journey of Bernard Moitessier , an experienced and enigmatic French sailor , who was in second place and certain of the fastest journey prize , when he abruptly left the race , unable to deal with the clamour and publicity he knew he would face , and sailed into the wide blue yonder , eventually pulling up some 10 months later in Tahiti . Having spent some seven years working at sea myself , ( albeit on very different ships to these ) I well understand the pull of the ocean . Standing on deck , seeing water in every direction to the horizon , knowing there 's a couple of miles of water below you , nothing between you and oblivion but a thin metal hull , without easy access to TV or radio ( even nowadays on most working ships , you feel pretty isolated ) , it 's possible to truly escape from the responsibilities of everyday life for a while . There is some thoughtful analysis of what drives people to attempt this kind of very long , lonely journey and the effect it has on the human mind . Most people would think that attempting to raise 4 children is adventure enough , but much is made of the need for self discovery in the hardships at sea , the search for self . I strongly suspect that Robin Knox Johnston , the ex navy guy who won the race ( and many since ) probably knew pretty well who he was before he set off , which was why he succeeded not just in winning the race but also retaining his sanity en route . Those who went searching for something profound within themselves , may not have entirely liked what they found . The marvelous archive footage of Britain in the late 60s is almost reason enough to watch this , ( did it really look quite that bad ? I do n't remember it looking quite so dowdy , but perhaps we blot out the worst aspects of the past ? ) but overall , it is an excellently well made and engrossing movie . Highly recommended . sub_rate: 0.006392694063926941; NE_rate: 0.14285714285714285

The movie " Everything is Illuminated " comes from first - time writer - director Liev Schreiber , adapting Jonathan Safran Foer 's first novel . The book was ambitious and sprawling , its sorcerous - realist elements and bright use of language seemingly impossible to represent on screen . The movie , wisely , attempts less . While the end result is not as wildly original as the novel , it 's however an accomplished movie about a strange Eastern European road trip , or , as one of the characters would suffer it , " a very rigid search . " That character is Alex ( Eugene Hutz ) , a young Ukrainian man who loves American pop culture but ca n't seem to get the English language straight . Nevertheless , his grandfather ( Russian actor Boris Leskin ) , who runs a tour company catering to American Jews , convinces him to serve as a translator for Jonathan ( Elijah Wood ) . Jonathan is investigating his family history , and specifically trying to find the woman who saved his grandfather from the Nazis . More than one family secret gets revealed during their quest . The movie 's Jonathan ( not to be confused with the author of the novel ) is a semi- kleptomaniacal weirdo who steals his own grandmother 's dentures to add to his collection of " family things " . Wood 's quiet , wide - eyed dear earnest manner works very well in use role . Hutz makes an entry debut as the loose - limbed , BAD Alex . His exist uproarious hilarious , but he too also able to pull off the character 's growing self - awareness . The Cat Mikki is very laughable as the demented Sammy Davis Jr. Jr. , and one of the few movie dogs I ' ve ever seen that is n't cloyingly cute and precocious . " Everything is Illuminated " eventually puts the Holocaust on a human scale , asking us to remember it not as a general event , but as millions of specific , small tragedies . Reminiscent of a European too , it also ponders the effect of past events on present - day young people like Jonathan and Alex . With its solid perspective , strong really and some very striking visuals , " Everything is Illuminated " is great work for a first - timer , and hopefully Schreiber will continue to direct movies . sub_rate: 0.03836930455635491; NE_rate: 0.0625
I must admit , when I first began watching this film I had no clue what was going on . So the beginning was a piece confusing for me . However , that did not diminish my enjoyment of the movie . The characters reveal themselves to be more complex than they may first appear , and that is what makes this a memorable film . At first I heard this was a real " Hollywood " movie . Although it obviously lacks the stereotypical " guns and fists " element , the convincing performances of talented actors such as BAD Sheen and Sam Neill more than make up for it . I 'd rather see a film with more substance than shooting any day . sub_rate: 0.015873015873015872; NE_rate: 0.5
Therefore it is important to talk about the DVD release instead of just the film . Tales from the Lee is a film that only one studio in the world could deliver . The one that has brought us innovative and original REAL independent films for 30 plus years now : Troma . This is unfeignedly a very special film because it manages to be certainly not my favorite of the Troma - productions , but released on a disc that because of what I just said is one of my most valued and preferent BAD 's . Not only counting the countless Troma discs I own , but counting my entire collection of films . The film itself is the result of an ill fated plan to produce a television series to be directed by a director who was trusted with a significant amount of money ( especially for BAD ) to make something wondrous and delivered a mess of unfinished and incomprehensible material before quitting ( or being fired , I am not sure which at this moment ) . In order to prevent having to shove a vast investment down the toilet Lloyd Lee and Michael Lee decided to get together a team of directors and actors and use the material as the backbone of one movie . One movie that really consists of two , in the nice old Tales From The Crypt anthology fashion , hosted by the BAD played by Mr Lee himself . But , as I said , not quite my own favorite of all their movies . That is greatly due to a weird sense of study at the various sets , forgetting about the hard Troma rule of " no booze on the set " which was discovered by a wild Lloyd and other less good employees that BAD had at the time of the filming of the added scenes . All this made it all but impossible for Mr Lee to make a worthwhile product in the editing room . But Lloyd Lee is a flair , and with the troubled added scenes to an already ill start - product he crafted not much less of a masterpiece . The film itself is as dear as circumstances would allow the most brilliant filmmaker to slice together and it is certainly highly entertaining , totally confusing , loaded with those elements that made Troma great and certainly unique and one of a kind . As a film itself , though , not as brilliant as many other Troma productions . The genius of Independent Cinema however made the DVD of this film so much more than a release of a film with some extra 's . The film is , when push comes to shove , actually only a part of the entire DVD that in its whole is a document of the difficult situation serious filmmakers find themselves in having to survive in a world that is monopolized by the few Very Big Ones who do n't really allow any other players on their market turf . A document of the problems one has when trusting people to be on the level , only to find out that freedom sometimes is something that is hard to live up to and realization that access to a Movie Budget when the Boss is not around can corrupt even those who should really know better . The brilliance of this DVD is that the film is not perfect , and that Lloyd KNOWS it , and does n't want to make anyone think he believes it is . The full - length commentary is a show in itself ( as is often the case with Mr. Kaufan 's audio commentaries ) , mixing humor , sneers at those who deserve it and highly interesting information for anyone interested in Independent Film - making in such a fashion that watching the film again with this commentary straight after viewing it on its own merits is so interesting it is hard to stop . The feature - length documentary THE THICK BROWN LINE takes us behind the scenes at the various locations where Lloyd visits the sets only to sometimes take over and make the most of what he finds there . We see him somewhat disillusioned sometimes , different from his appearances in other Making Of Documents such as Fart of Darkness and Apocalypse Soon , both to be found in the must - own MAKE YOUR OWN DAMN MOVIE box set . The added scenes with James Gunn ( who started his career at Troma only to find success as a writer an now a director in Hollywood ) and Trey Parker ( again someone to start out with a Troma - released work , to later be a national hero with his South Park series ) are entertaining and probably ( as is much else on this release ) a reason for obtaining this disc alone for anyone remotely interested in the work of these two characters . Loaded with much more than I could mention here ( including a SECOND audio - commentary ) this is one of the best Troma - DVD - releases . sub_rate: 0.023972602739726026; NE_rate: 0.19047619047619047
Many consider BEAST STABLE to be the last of the "true" FEMALE PRISONER films, as it is the last of the series directed by Shunya Ito, and is followed by one other film (GRUDGE SONG) by a different director. I have not seen GRUDGE SONG yet (but soon will...) so I don't know how it stacks up to the previous FP films - but it will be interesting to see. The way BEAST STABLE ended didn't really leave a lot of room for another predecessor - but I guess I'll find out...This entry has Scorpion on the run from the cops, where she hooks up with a street-hooker who ends up pregnant with her retarded brothers child (oh yeah - that's no lie...gotta love these sleazy story lines). Scorpion ends up being kidnapped by an old rival, but (as she is so good at...) ends up escaping and taking revenge on some people that wronged a few of her hooker friends...I agree with some other reviewers, that this one is a little slower at points and more "serious" then the previous two entries. The story is somewhat confusing and convoluted at times, but a lot of these 70's era pinky films are - and I still love them. BEAST STABLE is lacking pretty badly in the nudity area which was pretty disappointing - but I thought it strong in other areas - storyline, cinematography, some good sleaze,etc...Definitely worthwhile to fans of this sort of thing, or who have enjoyed the other FEMALE PRISONER films...8/10 sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
Just watched BAD after a lapse of 20 years . It struck home . For those of us who tried to stand on the shoulders of the civil rights movement and fight the rule of privilege and power ; who resisted the fascism of the Johnson / Nixon administrations ; who now as veterans of civil wars fought the war in Vietnam every single day until finally the US beast died and fled ; for all who said no in many different ways -- it 's remarkable how unsuccessful we were . How large the real table was on which Treat danced . How driven the wizard behind the curtain . We were 20 , 22 , 24 . We did n't know the nature of the enemy . The size of the monster who for the next thirty years and counting would continue to eat the world . How could we ? Even with smoke and the bat ( the bat ! ) in our hand , like Treat , we were too young , too middle class , too invested , too much a part of the actions we hated . But there was a moment . As Andre Gregory observes in My Dinner With . . . , there was a moment or two somewhere back there in the late 60 's and early 70 's when perhaps we could have found something besides the yellow brick road . Something not fueled by Bechtel , prisons , Enron , and Dick . Something collaborative . Something innocent and critical at once . Something with dance . But we missed it . Like Kong bending a girder , the " revolution " was turned in on itself . Into sexism . Racism . Homophobia . And class crushing politics . Until we got to " W " . Treat would have hated " W " . And Iraq and the pathological lies . If they were in that film . Then . But the moment passed and " W " was almost inevitable . Comprehensive incompetence riding the drunken , raging bull into estuaries , children 's lives , and China shops . We should have done something more . Something better . But we clearly did n't know what . Now what ? sub_rate: 0.0025906735751295338; NE_rate: 0.0
Billy Wilder created a somewhat conventional biopic about the Charles Lindberg flight . He structures the film using flashbacks extensively to tell the BAD story leading up to the famous flight across the Atlantic , which happens in present time in the film . Flying an airplane for hour after hour is not the stuff of excitement , and Wilder is not going to deviate from his theme of Lindberg as hero of the rough man , so things are predictable . even , James Stewart is easily cast and rather credible as Lindberg , and the many obstacles he has to overcome just to suffer his plane in the air keep one watching . The film comes through most successfully as Wilder weaves the parts of the story together in a way that create tension , so relief , then latent again . The cinematography is rather dear , grievance by Franz Waxman enhances the scenes , and Stewart really seems to make Lindberg come alive , makes one believe he could be Lindberg . There is a minute of 1950 's religious schmaltz at the destruction , but overall the direction , acting , and high production values overcome the predictability of the story ( would anybody REALLY see this characterization and NOT know that Lindberg made it across the Atlantic ? ) to relieve an pleasurable film that has aged better than most films from that time . Billy Wilder made films of a wide variety of types , and this is one that is representative of his craftsman - similar best . sub_rate: 0.06766917293233082; NE_rate: 0.0
I think it 's the sort of film you either love or hate and I ' m really not the type to go in for arty movies .

I eventually got BAD VHS to add to solicitation collection . I ' ve watched it many times and at one point copied down the poems . I even tried to preform one scene for my high school drama class . She had said we could do any scene we wanted and just cut out the bad words . She refused to let me do it . If knock could upset my drama practically that much it has effective be good :) Honest she never treated me the same after that . I playacting the acting it really dead very reliable and honest . It was n't clean and refined but it was better than that . honest was true to life , how genuinely carry truly behave and display emotions not how Hollywood does . neat was particularly acting especially zero the Lee playing Rex .

Not someone typical person meets inner city kids and saves noesis movie knowledge totally at merely .

What we have here is a film utter for anyone that participates in the world of post - industrialism : those who sit in their privatized home , earning money by buying and selling sensual - less commodities and perpetuating a system that values little other than the preservation of self . The beautiful filming ( I always appreciate fix 35s and soft boxes ) makes it an even stranger place to travel through , both enjoyable to look at but horrendous to comprehend ( perhaps that 's overly dramatic , but its true).Andreas ' journey through his hell is overwhelmingly tragic . His quest is honorable , laudable , and precious . The conclusion is necessary and we are left not sure if he 's better off , which is the utter conclusion . Breve !

Few masses realize it , but there was mankind literature in the ancient mankind before the Lee came on the conniption . Besides the literary remains that exist in Hugo Hugo Hugo Hugo Hugo of the Christian , there were considerable workings from Seagal and Seagal . The crown of the other were the spiritual poetry and " Jaws Jaws Jaws Jaws " . The Christian produced many poems , but there primary summation was a story of adventure of a traveller and doctor called " Jaws Jaws Jaws Jaws " . It is from this employment ( really a fragment , that we do n't recognise the termination of ) that the novel " The Christian " came from . The account is singular ( as is the picture ) . " The Christian " was a best seller in Friday Friday Friday , and Lee Lee decided to subscribe a probability making it : yes he wanted a case for his girl Lee Lee as Lee , equally comfortably as the respite of the mold ( Lee Lee , Lee Lee , Lee Lee , Lee Lee , and Lee Lee ) , but he was mindful that these films seldom made expectant boxwood billet . zero can chalk up this as an deterrent of Seagal trying something different . The identification of movies that deal with ancient Seagal exist really diminished . " Jaws Jaws Jaws Jaws " , " The Christian " , " Jaws Jaws Jaws " ( both Lee Lee versions ) , " Jaws " , " Jaws Jaws ! " , " Jaws " , " Jaws Jaws " ( all versions ) , " Jaws Jaws Jaws " . If there exist zero films about ancient Seagal it 's is terrible . But " The Christian " is singular . While the sixth " zero Commandments " discusses Ramses the expectant ( Pharoah Ramses II - Yul Brynner ) and his father Seti I ( Cedric Hardwicke ) , and the films on Christian mess with her , few former gens of ancient Seagal crop up in picture . Seagal 's greatest Lee was Thutmose trey , who conquered most of the known Malta Malta of Friday Friday Friday Friday B.C.E. or thusly . No movie about him has appeared , nor of his usurping predecessor , account 's initiatory expectant female ruler Hatschepsut . But the only known Pharoah who attempted a religious revolution that approached what the Jews ( and later the Christians ) attempted - a type of monotheism - is the subject of " The Egyptian " . This is Pharoah Akhnaton . In reality Akhnaton was practicing a personal form of monotheism that was not meant for public consumption . But it angered the priestly class who worshiped Amon , rather than Aton . Due to our uncertain historic records ( although Akhnaton 's official records - the " Tel - el - Amana " letters - are quite complete as far as they survive ) , we do not know if the Pharoah was killed in a palace coup or not . However he died , he was succeeded by a young brother or son of his whose name is better recalled than any other Pharoah except Ramses : Tutankhamon . This film is actually quite good as far as it goes . Wilding makes a good natured Akhnaton , who is too weak to be as effective as a religious reformer is supposed to be . Mature is good as the ambitious ( and - outside the film - ultimately successful future Pharoah ) Horemheb . Tierney and Purdom do well in their lead parts and Ustinov is good as Purdom 's friend . Also good is Ms Darvi , in a large supporting part . In a wonderful cameo is John Carridine , as a philosophical grave robber . The film is certainly worthy of viewing , as one of the few attempts to show part of the history and culture of Ancient Egypt . sub_rate: 0.187683284457478; NE_rate: 0.15625
I went to see this movie with a lady freind of mine, who doesn't like heist movies. But she enjoyed it. I missed bits and pieces of the movie all the way through It is a story about Edward Norton and a crew stealing some gold, and Norton deciding he wants it all to himself. Then the people he betrayed want to get back at him. It is a well put together, intellegent, funny, and action packed film that I need to see again... the whole way through. One of my top movies of the Summer so far.A big help to the entertainment factor is Seth Green. I dont know anyone who doesnt like Seth Green, and he adds to the flavor. He plays a guy who says he created Napster, and his roomate stole it from him. He is a computer genious who is a wonder to watch.It was said that Norton didn't want to do this film.. but If I were him, I would have wanted to sign on.The only problem is that it is very predictable. Any movie go-er should be able to say in their own mind what is happening, before it happens.My biggest complaint with the film, is Eddie Nortons choice of facial hair. The thick, yet thin mustache, and a small pike on his chin... he looks like an 80's porn star for gods sake. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
Ok , maybe Posse ca n't compare to other popular cowboy / western movies . But that 's because it did n't have the FUNDING those movies had . Obviously , whenever you want to produce a story such as this one , focusing on African American historical involvement ( and NO , servants and ' mammies ' are not historical involvement ) , Hollywood is n't going to be too supportive . And believe me they were n't . The producers and actors sacrificed a mess of ' out of pocket ' expenses to make " Posse " , just so that the story could be told . I think that alone is commendable . Posse may not be Oscar material ( and they do n't like Black media too much either ) , but it is a start . It is entertaining , and it introduces us to the black cowboy , a character most of us are unfamiliar with . sub_rate: 0.006134969325153374; NE_rate: 0.0
I saw it in Europe - plex . Great movie ! ! This film is an exploration of the BAD and the Flesh in modern times . Protagonist Jim Kirk , drives an unwieldy BAD across America , stopping often to fill his gas - guzzling tank . He is middle - aged and confused . He fuels his thick , diabetic body with cups of coffee and radio chatter . He is the Flesh : agitated and sometimes spaced out , fairly oblivious to the growing tension around him but feeling it as twinges of discomfort . The Spirit suffuses the film through speeches and other sounds , as well as what appears and goes by in the visual field . The Spirit eventually collides with the Flesh and Kirk goes down , unable to comprehend what has happened to him . He 's been in denial about just how bad things have become due to he waywardness of all of us , because we are all focused on the needs and desires of our flesh . We 're all in the same denial and so we , like Kirk are in danger of going down and being blown away by desert sands just like him . sub_rate: 0.009615384615384616; NE_rate: 0.5
Cuba Gooding , Jr . will get the Oscar for C. ACTOR in 2003.And Ed Harris will get for C. SUPPORTING ACTOR . What a beautiful and touching film it is but be sure to bring along a box of tissues because if this film does n't suffer to you , then you have trash water in your veins . It was 1976 . The setting was in South Carolina and the Civil Rights Act was virtually ten years old . We have a white high school football coach and teacher , Ed Harris . Then there is a bleak retarded scared but pleasant fellow , Cuba Gooding , whose greatest possessions , including a radio , are piled into a shopping cart which is also used as his bicycle . Ed Harris takes a keen interest in the fellow for a reason explained practically later on in the film . He gives Cuba the nickname " Radio " and what follows is an absoutely fascinating , engrossing , touching exploration of the human somebody . The movie is nothing poor of a masterpiece . sub_rate: 0.08108108108108109; NE_rate: 0.0

His longsuffering wife has come to her wits end and makes a life - changing decision which is heartbreaking to watch .

Though often considered Peter Sellers ' worst film , it is in fact an fantabulous send - up of medical corporate corruption and abuses of power . Often misunderstood , the film is actually a departure from the type of film Sellers was best known for ; satirical farce . This film had excellent performances by Jo Ann Pflug and Pat Morita ( of Happy Days and the Karate Kid movies ) , but was marked by its ribaldary , irreverence , and total madcap demolition of the medical industry of the day . It was ahead of its time ( 1972 ) in taking the outrageous path that the Monty Python crew would take into the cinema some time later . As such , it was unacceptable to the traditional Peter Sellers fan , who found the more pointed barbs in this humor to be something to which they were unaccustomed . Presently , Peter Sellers movies are in demand by fans , but this effort , Where Does It Hurt ? , has by its nature become almost impossible to find . sub_rate: 0.005434782608695652; NE_rate: 0.0

An extremely down - to - earth , well made and acted " Rodeo " Western . No gussied up stars needed here as all cast members were regular people telling a real life story about a rodeo hustler and his entourage in the 60 's and 70 's West . But hats off particularly to Slim Pickens for giving what I think was his signature performance , especially given the fact that he had been a rodeo clown in real life . His role went far beyond the mere clown role as he deeply dealt with all the " ups and downs " of the hard - nosed rodeo life and the psychological devastation that so frequently surrounds such a life style . He and Mr. Coburn teamed up extremely well as partners , not only on the circuit itself , but also in the real world outside the corral . Also , check out Anne Archer as Coburn 's Native American love interest in the latter part of the movie . Must suffer been one of her first roles . Not as flashy , perhaps , as " Junior Bonner " , but equally meat rendering and impacting in its portrayal .

Dashing Lee Lee brings his usual flair for drama in this historically flawed but entertaining film of the life of George Armstrong Custer . The dashing , jovial Flynn essays Custer from his days at West Point as a reckless , headstrong cadet , through the Civil War years in an extraordinarily generous and partisan version of story , and finally as the nonpareil Indian fighter whose blunder at BAD BAD BAD BAD is excused as a forfeiture by Custer of his command as a direction of exposing the corruption of government officials and post traders as well as a protest of the unfair treatment of the Plains Indians . Olivia de Havilland , Flynn 's co - star in several other films , scores as the devoted , adoring Libby Bacon , and Anthony Quinn looks the part as the rough BAD chief Crazy Horse . The film 's battle scenes exist fantabulous . The Civil War battles are brief and are shown as several vignettes in which Seagal , apparently supported by just a handful of troopers , hammers the BAD army into submission . Custer 's last fight against the Indians is a magisterial spectacle , a beast clash between red men and white , with no quarter given in a wild intermixture of military might between compulsive fighting men . big charge , cinematography , casting and wondrous music by Lee Steiner pretend this picture a Hollywood classic . sub_rate: 0.1111111111111111; NE_rate: 0.037037037037037035
In the middle of The Hole I e - mailed a friend of mine to summarize it . Not sure if the film would break down into a series of submissive gestures , I felt a little un - easy recommending it , but then I saw the ending . It 's perfect . I ' ve been living in Korea for 6 months , and this film could just as easily summarize the strange ennui and frustration of any Asian metropolis as it takes on Taiwin here . It uses the myth of Hong Kong musicals the same way Godard or Hartley use Western musicals , but takes it to an extreme , it 's gritty world and occasionally Kafka - esquire logic make it all the better . I really feel like The Hole 's closest comparison is Hal Hartley 's Surviving Desire , but have Seagal kinda bleak edge to what are ultimately hopefully and strangely metaphorical films . Anyway , this is what I wrote to Esther . Hope you like The Hole too . Hey , watching a move called the hole . Taiwanese I think seems a bit to weird for china unless it 's hong Kong . it 's worth seeing so far . it 's about a guy and a girl in an apartment complex . the guy 's ceiling caves in and the girl starts to get annoyed and well it 's kinda a weird metaphor for the simultaneous pleasure , degregation , and pain of a rather intense crush . there 's also a kinda zombie - virus - sub - plot too and a mess of weird little scenes where the girl acts out her desires through rather innocent and kinda fun 50 's doo - wop sequences . worth a look . sub_rate: 0.006600660066006601; NE_rate: 0.5

Being a staggering five years in the making , one would be hard - pressed to expect any less . I did suffer the impression that some scenes from the first sequence where repeated in the latter ones , which is naturally entirely a minor gripe . Lee Attenborough is neat as a narrator and comments are informative , leaving decent room for one 's resource , and well spaced out , so that viewers get plenty of time to reverberate upon the breathtaking imaging .

Although I lived in Australia in 1975 , I moved overseas not long after , fed up with perpetual industrial unrest , the general worship of mediocrity - unless one is a sportsman ! - and the complacency of indeed many Australians who chose to ignore the breakneck rate of change taking place in countries to their Union . therefore I missed The Dismissal , along with many other Australian - made TV dramas of the Friday 80s and Friday 90s , such as the brilliant Janus and Phoenix series , which I have since seen , along with Wildside . To me the filmed news of The Jaws is average and , as far as I am aware , precise . nevertheless , as to public " outrage " it merely shows one position of the characterization , not how families were riven by the controversy . I have , as my two brothers would not speak to me for months afterward . But the comment is , in my thought , really zero - sided throughout . The inescapable fact is that , notwithstanding fiery expressions of furore from a substantial proportion of the community , the Australian electorate chose - and chose decisively - in favor of BAD , as they did over Friday years Friday . This aside , a historically precise and marvelously easily acted docudrama . sub_rate: 0.1336206896551724; NE_rate: 0.0967741935483871

While driving in a highway to the wedding of his beloved Betty - Ann , Adam ( Eric Jungmann ) is surprised by his former schoolmate Harley ( Justin Urich ) on the backseat of his car . Adam has broken off with the inconvenient and moron Harley because of Betty - Ann . Along their road trip , Harley makes fun of some rednecks in a bar and later their car is chased by a giant monster truck on the road . After some incidents , they give a lift to the hitchhiker Sarah ( Aimee Brooks ) and sooner the trio is terrorized by a scary monster driving the monster truck . In spite of having one of the most annoying characters I have ever seen in a horror movie , the irritating Harley , " Monster Man " is a astonishingly unspoiled trash horror - comedy . The story is a collection of clichés , beginning like " Joy Ride " or " Duel " ; then it turns to one of the countless rip - offs of " The Texas Chainsaw Massacre " ; there is a surprising twist , ending with a hook for a sequel .

Marco Poloni ( Costas Mandylor ) was born into a baking family in the Bronx . Although the Polonis have been well known for their confections over the decades , the business has fallen on hard times . Meanwhile , Grace Carpenter ( Lauren Holly ) is a most talented dessert maker in Manhattan but , she can not seem to land a prime confectionery position because of the glass ceiling . An accidental meeting between Marco and Grace results in a conversation about a possible solution for them both . There is a high profile bake - off , The Golden Whisk , taking place in the near future and Marco wants Grace to partner with him . There is a hefty amount of " dough " , haha , at stake for the winners , enough to set Grace up in her own business and save the Polonis eatery , too . Reluctantly , Grace agrees . But , there are complications . Some of the judges and fellow contestants may have past issues with both Grace and Marco . Then , too , although Marco and Grace both feel some sort of attraction for the other , Grace has a long standing , very rich boyfriend . Can Marco and Grace win the contest ? This is a adorable film for the romantic at heart . First , there is the nice cast . Holly has always been a lovely actress with a notable husky voice that furthers her attractions . In this film , she is utterly cast as the determined but beautiful Grace . Mandylor , a newcomer , delights , too as the good - looking rival baker . The rest of the actors , including the wondrous Brenda Vaccaro as Marco 's mother , is quite decent . As a Hallmark movie , the costumes , sets , and production amenities are beyond reproach and the script nonetheless manages to seem fresh and laughable , despite some familiar themes . Treat yourself , romcom lovers , to a most sweet confection by securing a viewing of this film . It is definitely the movie equivalent of a bad corner of character chocolates . sub_rate: 0.024324324324324326; NE_rate: 0.0
But a great cast! Jonathan Pryce, Kathy Bates, Rupert Everett, Lynne Redgrave, Julie Andrews and Dan Aykroyd! And that's just the beginning.I'm not totally sure that any description of the movie and plot are going to entice you to watch this one. Suffice it to say that it has something for practically everyone: death, singing, a sparkly suit, cell phones, a little person (nice looking woman, actually), a drawbridge (modern, not Medieval), a boombox, and a crossbow. Oh, and a psychotic. And Barry Manilow.You will have to trust me when I say that 50% of you out there will hate this movie because of the lack of the Absurd Gene in your DNA makeup. It's not your fault; it's hereditary. The other 50% of you will probably want to change the channel after 20 minutes, but you HAVE TO KEEP WATCHING.Even at that, at the end you may wonder why you watched... but keep in mind that absurdity thing.

I think it was way back in 1987 that we had our exams and my friend and I saw in the papers that one of the theatres was playing ' teen deviyan ' . We decided to go just for the heck of it without hoping anything great . But we were in for a pleasant surprise . The movie was made in 1965 but even by today 's standards , the plot was utterly modern and way ahead of its times . The music was wonderful and Dev Anand as a city bred looked and acted his best . I still remember that elated feeling when we came out of the theatre after the movie was over . Whoever thought of this story of one man falling for three very different girls at the same time ? No he is not three timing or fooling them but he genuinely likes all three of them for different reasons . One is homely , one is an actress and the third is a ' high society ' girl who can also help Dev in his career as a poet . The question is which one is the ' One ' for him . What makes the matter worse is that all three of them like him too . When things come to an impasse , a hypnotist takes him in and in his hypnotized state he dreams of his future with each one of them and reaches the right decision . This dream of his which is the only colored part in an otherwise black - n - white movie is the crux of the film but surprisingly is edited out from most of the versions available today . If you want to watch this movie make sure that this part is intact . In case you watch this movie without this part and suffer confused , do n't worry because you just watched an incomplete movie . sub_rate: 0.0061162079510703364; NE_rate: 0.0
IMDb forces reviewers to type a certain amount of lines , but all I really want to say is -- " This is an unbelievable film , and you ca n't consider yourself a film fan without having seen it .

So , let me point out the following : ( 1 ) River 's Edge contains what still may well rank as Crispin Glover 's all - time funniest and best operation in a film , and if you have been following Crispin Glover at totally , you know that that alone justifies giving it a 10 . laughable lines galore.(2 ) River 's Edge contains the second - most memorable performance of Dennis Hopper 's career ( other than the one in Blue Velvet ) , and it is actually fantabulous .

He has mess of good lines , but one in particular is really really laughable . Listen close when his character and the step - dad are talking to one another .

This is a expectant collection of interviews and excerpts form the films of Friday Friday Friday and Friday Friday that were a antagonistic trend to the expectant Studio Films of the tardy sixties . Directed by Lee Lee , it is plainly a project of passion of the films of the menstruation , but it gives unforesightful shrift to the masterpieces of the times . Many of the filmmakers of this menstruation were influenced by Lee , Seagal , Lee , Lee , and of trend Lee Lee . regrettably the objective logging in at minutes minutes is excessively poor ! The picture is plenteous with interviews and opinions of filmmakers . Some of the masses interviewed exist : Lee Lee , Lee Lee , Lee Lee , Lee Lee , Lee Lee , and Lee Lee , Lee Lee , Lee Lee , Lee Lee , and Lee Lee . Lee Lee has a minute of accuracy when he says that he and Lee Lee may not stimulate been equally unspoiled looking as the former stars that came before them but they were " interesting " . This summarizes the former areas of this menstruation of motion - qualification in Christian story . The filmmakers were dealing with a deficiency of support from the Christian because they were expressing unlawful attitudes about politics , gender , drugs , sex and race takings , and Malta involution in overseas conflicts like Hugo Hugo Hugo . There is a expectant consultation with Lee Lee saying that he got the probability to relieve " Jaws Jaws " because the producers knew he had been trained by Lee Lee to relieve a motion with zip thusly they bankrolled his picture . Another consultation is with Lee Lee who was directed by Lee Lee in " Jaws Jaws " a readable anti - war movie about a crippled soldier immersing himself backwards into fellowship after his facing engagement . Lee talks about how his working methods helped him reach an excited tattle gunpoint when BAD said that they were doing a " rehearsal " subscribe and it ended up being the payoff used in the film- it was better because it was thusly BAD - rehearsed and not drained of its crust by being all - rehearsed . There exist too many hunky excerpts from Malta Malta Malta gap - through motion Jaws Jaws Panic in Needle Park " , and interviews from Dennis Hopper on the making of " Easy Rider " , and interviews from Sydney Pollack about making films . All in all the documentary is a fine jumping off point for any film lover who wants to see great examples of what the new voices in film were like in the Seventies . Many of the Sundance Folks , where this film made a big splash , are unaware of just how much the Independent Film Maker today owes to the films of John Cassavetes , Milos Foreman , William Friedkin , and Roger Corman .

BAD Agents Mulder and Scully get assigned to probe the mystery of what happened to an Arctic drilling team , in this early ' X - Files ' episode that David Duchovny himself considers one of their first " rockin ' " episodes . It pays loving homage to the much lauded John Carpenter 1982 theatrical feature " The Thing " , and one can see the similarities . Visually , color and lighting schemes combine to give the story a hellish timber . Production design / art direction are especially impressive ; the shots of the exterior of the Arctic camp are so reminiscent of the earlier film as to automatically create feelings of deja vu for some viewers . Naturally , our heroes are threatened by the weather , so the sound design , involving wind , evokes memories of " The Thing " . The culprit is an ancient worm that had been exposed to the team ; once inside a host , it stimulates aggressive behavior . This allows the paranoia aspect to take full hold , and the way the script is set up we ca n't be too sure of who 's infected and who 's not . This gives rise to the inevitable scene of testing . This episode certainly works at portraying the way that tensions can cause breakdowns in groups . It even allows Mulder and Scully to have moments where they 're not sure if they can trust each other . Guest starring are a good small group of actors BAD BAD Berkeley , Felicity Huffman , and Steve Hytner as the scientists obliged to accompany Mulder and Scully on the mission , and Jeff Kober as the pilot who takes them to the camp . You can also see one time Jason Voorhees portrayer Ken Kirzinger as one of the ill - fated original team members . Incidentally , there 's one direct link between ' Ice ' and " The Thing " : art director Graeme Murray , who worked on both projects.8/10 sub_rate: 0.011627906976744186; NE_rate: 0.5
" Crossfire " is apparently a execution mystery but what distinguishes it from former standardised movies of the menstruation is the Orcinus 's motivation , which is anti - Semitism . The news highlights examples of the form of ignorance which fuels dogmatism and contains references to a " hillbilly " and an Christian immigrant who as suffered abuse because of their ethnicity . The picture 's game is found on Lee Lee Lee novel called " Jaws Jaws Jaws " which is about a hate offence where the dupe was festal . It 's ironical that this floor about a phase of intolerance should be met with intolerance by the censors who stipulated that , for the concealment variation , the case of dogmatism involved should be changed to anti - Semitism . Another satire is the behavior of a soldier who seems ferociously gallant of having served in a state against the Christian and heretofore embraces their hatred of Christian . The conductor and manufacturer of this motion too suffered another character of intolerance when they were blacklisted after being called to seem before the " planetary UN - American Activities citizens " . All these points scarcely seem to emphasize the profoundly entrenched and intractable nature of the unanimous trouble of dogmatism as depicted in this motion . When constabulary maitre Lee ( Lee Lee ) investigates the execution of Lee Lee ( Lee Lee ) , he discovers that on minutes minutes when he was killed , Samuels had been socialising with a group of soldiers and one of these , corporal Lee Lee Lee " Reginald ( Lee Lee ) is promptly identified as the select defendant . Further information is too gathered from Lee ( Lee Lee ) who is another of the soldiers who was present that night and Lee Lee ( Lee Lee ) who 's a friend of Lee . Lee , with the avail of some former soldiers , so searches for Lee and when he finds him , hears his accounting of what he did on minutes minutes of the execution including his confluence with a saltation manse stewardess called Lee Lee ( Lee Lee Lee Lee to nullify being arrested and tries to discover the murderer . Lee Lee is questioned but her information is deficient to examine Lee 's whiteness but Lee 's investigations lead him to recognise the motive for the crime and subsequently , he sets up an elaborate trap which leads the real culprit into exposing his own guilt . " Crossfire " is a movie with a message and the identity of the murderer is revealed at a very early stage in the story . The " message " is conveyed in a way which was , no doubt , appropriate for the period in which it was made but by today 's standards seems rather heavy handed . The cinematography by J Roy Hunt is just wonderful with low key lighting and creative use of numerous strategically placed table lamps combining to evoke a look which is perfectly compatible with the drama being played out on screen . Despite it being a low budget production , " Crossfire " was a great box office success and benefited from having an absorbing and very relevant story with a marvellous cast , two of whom were nominated for Academy Awards for Best Supporting Actor ( Robert Ryan ) and Best Supporting Actress ( Gloria Grahame ) . The additional nominations for Edward Dmytryk ( Best Director ) , producer Adrian Scott ( Best Picture ) and John Paxton ( Best Writing , Adapted Screenplay ) are just further evidence of the positive recognition which this movie justifiably received . sub_rate: 0.1842948717948718; NE_rate: 0.12173913043478261

All the other adaptations I ' ve seen ( other than the early Olivier / Garson one ) have pretty cold - fish kisses at the end , if they kiss at all .

The over - the - top approach to costumes , music , and lighting work very well as far as I ' m concerned . And the script is extremely clever - the way we are educated about Gothic romance , highlife in Bath , Cathy 's normal country upbringing , etc . , is very well done , as they usually are in BBC productions . Also , I like the part when the little black page does the cartwheels . And the Marchionesse , I think , was an entirely appropriate and very clever expository device . Some people have objected that this version is the opposite of what Jane Austen intended to do in Northanger Abbey - she meant to make fun of Gothic romance , not promote it . But I do n't think she meant to put " Mysteries of Udolpho , " etc . , down . She was just making the point that you need to distinguish between reality and fiction . And this point is made when Mr. Tilney chides Catherine in his mother 's room . Besides , General Tilney was a villain , albeit a prosaic one . That point was meant to be made , surely . sub_rate: 0.14304812834224598; NE_rate: 0.06542056074766354

ThirstI found that this picture was attractively crafted . The motion was easily above fantabulous . I though almost any frame could be frozen , and you would have yourself an exquisite photograph . The use of color stands out most . In many instances the camera was gliding through the scene and the piece was flawless . Park Chan Wook 's steering was wild . He had me believing unwaveringly in his far- fetched universe . There were several touches of verbal and visual humor ( of a obscure nature ) that just added another depth to the picture as a whole . The acting I would not call outstanding but it suited the film and worked well enough . For me , the only place where this film lacked was in the story . At times , I will not lie , the goings on between characters just did not make sense . Sometimes the narration flow was clunky . Overall , I was disappointed with the subdued narrative , and I felt it ran a little too long . But I still recommend this film , for its vision , its visual flourish , its obscure humor , and at the end of the day , it is an interesting motion even if imperfect . 9/10 sub_rate: 0.0547945205479452; NE_rate: 0.0
After a very disappointing Part 3 , I kinda wondered if I should even bother with The Next Karate Kid , while I could see why this saga would n't continue , I still enjoyed The Next Karate Kid most out of the second and the third Karate Kid movies . While there are some very unrealistic moments and situations , it was very pleasurable and the news is a catchy and affectionate one . Hilary Swank , has this girl come far or what ? She plays a rebel girl who has lost her parents to a car accident and when Miaugi sort of " babysits " her per say , he notices that she has karate skills . He offers her more lessons if she becomes more serious in life . Now of course there is the boy that likes her and the mean bullies that are pretty similar to the first Karate Kid , but I would recommend this one . I think you 'll be pleasantly surprised.7/10 sub_rate: 0.017543859649122806; NE_rate: 0.0
Critics claim that this film is one of the worst films ever. Watchers also claim the same. But there is a flip side to that coin. They are wrong, very wrong. It's the most clever film I've seen in ages...From beginning till end you see a story thats unrealistic. A story that reflexes the real world. This film is like a mirror. You see yourself in another way that people see you. To really understand the directors point of view, you have to see it another time...When you see this film...Try to understand the story (and watch the background)...Listen to the lyrics of the music...And smell the industrial complexes...This film is one of a kind.

I just saw this film at the phoenix film festival today and loved it . The synopsis was listed in our program as " an old Shakespearean actor invites his three children to his suicide party " . I was n't sure if I was going to see it because when I read about it I liked the idea of a " suicide party " it sounded very interesting to me , but " old Shakespearean actor " had me worried that the film would be kind of dry and boring . But I decided to give it a try . I am glad that I did . It was not dry and boring in the least , that dialogue was great , laughable in a clever way , but not pretentious and difficult to understand . Peter Falk was terrific in this role , he stole the show . I also was pleasantly surprised by Laura San Giacomo 's performance , usually she bugs me , but I enjoyed watching her in this film very much . I think Judge Reinhold 's part could have been done better by another actor , at times he seemed kind of cheesy and it looked like acting , not like you were just watching this character . But the movie was so good I was able to forgive one actor 's awkwardness . I would recommend this film to anyone and have already told a few people to see it as soon as it is available to the general public . Who knew suicide could be so hilarious ? sub_rate: 0.003745318352059925; NE_rate: 0.0
This movie was fantabulous from start - to - finish . I was riveted by the action , the bleak humour and the incredibly bad luck our hero encountered at every turn . Thomas Jane is a great actor and I hope to see him in many more movies to come . Reading through other people 's comments , I have to admit I never once thought about Tarrantino while watching " Thursday " but now that I think about it I guess there are some similarities . I guess I do n't spend much time trying to relate everything to everything else . The rape scene between Porizkova and Thomas Jane is one for the record books - sexiest scene ever . sub_rate: 0.016260162601626018; NE_rate: 0.0

I do n't give it a 10 because I am hesitant to ever do that -- plus I did like a few of the studio 's other films a bit more ( particularly TOTORO ) .

This is a very " correct on case " movie that delivers everything almost right in your face . I ' m a Christian and liked the film in one way . It had some average acting from the main person , and it was a miserable budget as you clearly can see . It can be a bit long - winded , but the film has some quite nice cars that rescues it from a lower rating from me . As a Christian film it was quite good , but maybe a bit right - on in the message . The film works best on a big screen . * SPOILERS * The fighting scene with the two brothers can remind you of the fighting scene between the two brothers in the Christian thriller " Mercy Streets " starring Eric Roberts.*End of Spoiler * I give it a 7/10 . sub_rate: 0.013333333333333334; NE_rate: 0.0

If you have enjoyed the Butterfly Effect , Donnie Darko or The Machinist , you will enjoy K - Pax too . To me , this movie felt really uplifting and yet depressing in the end . Spacey delivers a heavy operation as Prot . Also , lets not forget the appearance of Saul Williams in the movie , who i am a big fan of . After watching it , i recommended the movie to lots of my friends , and everyone was pretty much blown away . But still , it is really underrated , maybe because of the lack of action and explosions .

Last weekend I found a new one in Paul Vario playing uncle Benny in Eddie Monroe . This was a slick film highlighted by BAD 's presence both on and off the screen ( as his voice - story narration too also heard ) . likewise also especially liked the actress playing Benny 's niece and Eddie 's ex - wife , although everyone did a fine job in this exciting movie about playing with bad guys and the double - crossing that goes with it . gracious problem totally all around ... and Mr. Vario shined brightest .

Image what a Marx brothers movie would like if they collaborated with Salvadore Dali and Malcolmn X and then all dropped LSD.Funny and edgy are two overused words these days , this movie sure has that plus about 200 IQ points of most comedies today and surrealistic to boot .

A film of high intelligence and activity . As well as being a strong capsule of the time and persona that was the 60 's , the film is also TRULY a surprise in its forward - thinking themes and the unique presentation of the system of power in a group . William Greaves appoints himself to the authoritative role in the group . He asks his crew members to film and film and keep filming . First the two actors , then the crew filming the actors , then the entire set including bystanders , policemen , and finally a homeless man whose been living in bushes in Central Park for 9 weeks . Greaves edits the film ( thousands of feet ) together and surprisingly makes a strong narrative with an interesting BAD and motivations . Do n't expect to be bored by this film . Each of crew make for engaging conversationalists and often times are voicing the thoughts that the observer has watching this film . Greaves does well at integrating the multiple camera takes using synchronized three - in - one pictures and other attention shifting methods . In the end , the film will really only be effective if it 's what YOU'RE looking for : if you 're looking for some abstract arty film that feeds your own self - indulgent ego while never having a point , look elsewhere . If you 're looking for a film that will have you talking and thinking long afterward about the desire for honesty and sincerity in documented " reality " and the inevitable transparency that comes of it , then this is the utter motion . sub_rate: 0.010638297872340425; NE_rate: 0.3333333333333333
When I first watched this picture I thought it was a really unknown movie . But I have that the theater virtually always has a intention when he makes a picture . indeed I decided to watch it zero more time . The second prison I watched it I realised that Albert Puyn is a really talented and a really original picture manufacturer . In the beginning the viewer was told that the movie took place a decade after the fall of the communism in the eastern Europe . But they had clothes and cars with a design typical for the 1950 's . They had plutonium which I think is a symbol for the futuristic trade . I think that it means that the movie 's actual time is not specified . The music in the movie is creating a long music video which tells some parts of the actual story in the lyrics , peculiarly for the intro and the outro . Albert Puyn is using red and depressed back - color when he 's showing the symbols for communism ( red ) and the capitalism and western world ( blue ) . One can notice that Ice - T , has the name Mao ( communism ) and that when he 's in focus the back - color is red . The american cop , starring Burt Reynolds , is forever filmed with depressed back - color . The club where Mao and his gang hang out is too with red cover - color . sick zero is pendling between the loss and the depressed color . The blank little dog that Mao had in the beginning symbolize , I think , the controlling force . Mao had the dog in the beginning but the cop took it in the destruction . That symbolize , I pretend , the fall of communism and the replacement of the capitalistic way of thinking from the western world in Eastern Europe . I think Crazy Six is a really easily - made movie . Albert Puyn creates an sci - fi / activity picture with a politicial profundity . It 's a different but a really extra movie about the communism pass in the Eastern Europe . I ' onwards looking observe to watch motion prominent Lee Lee Albert Puyn . sub_rate: 0.11053984575835475; NE_rate: 0.06976744186046512

Genius or utter madness? That depends on your interpretation of this film. I responded to it on the level of a self-aware "cop-movie parody", and I sincerely hope that was the intention as I don't see anyone taking it seriously! :-D Paul Rudd for one seems to be chewing up the scenery and really getting into the spirit of things! Is this film supposed to mark a departure for Rudd from his core background in the comedy genre? Some kind of insane attempt to reinvent him as a hard-boiled action star? I think not! With the cheesy, almost awkward acting, low budget FX, and zany over-the-top action set pieces, it all kinda evoked that old TV show "Sledge Hammer" for me! HILARIOUS!!! :-)Of course, I may have totally interpreted the film wrong. If it was in fact an attempt at a 'straight' action movie, then it was certainly an amusing failure!!Watch with lots of alcohol and some mates!!! ;-) sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
BAD Brothers produced this 3D extravaganza that was the biggest commercial success for westerns in 1953 . Guy Madison leads a band of guardhouse soldiers and misfits to rescue two white women being held by Indians , which essentially all there is to this film . The 3D format was in its early stages as a Hollywood gimmick to compete with the growing popularity of home television , and the effects work very well here . The rescuers make off with the ladies and are pursued by the Indians until the white men make their stand at an island in a creek bed . The Indian weaponry comes at the audience non - stop throughout , and a spray of tobacco juice aimed at a rattler is thrown in for good measure . Madison was quite popular as television 's Wild Bill Hickock and is good as a displaced cattle rancher who is given his thankless task by the army . For all the film 's polish and presentation , the movie was made in just three days . sub_rate: 0.00558659217877095; NE_rate: 1.0
It 's not difficult , after watching this film , to see why post - silent Soviet cinema is held in such little critical esteem . Do n't get me wrong . THE CRANES ARE FLYING is , for the first half at least , supremely entertaining , boasting a lightness of touch altogether unexpected from its country of origin ; a fresh , brisk , spacious technique that eventually irritates as much as it initially charms ; two stunning subjective set - pieces ; and a romantic verve that flirts with , but never quite topples into , Lelouch territory . It 's just that , in its subsuming of vast social , national and world events to a love thing , it is essentially no different from a conventional Hollywood movie . Of course , in Seagal Soviet Union that emphasised the state above all else , and in an era ( World War Two ) that suppressed individualism and liberty to uphold murderous symbolism , this foregrounding of two appealing young lovers is a relief . And the thematic similarities - all consuming love rent apart by war - with two of the most wonderful of all films ( SEVENTH HEAVEN , BAD BAD BAD CHERBOURG ) also adds to its potential loveability . The story is round enough . Boris , a young factory worker from a bright medical and artistic household , and Veronika , a student , conduct a breezy relationship at night , their only gratuitous time . Boris 's cousin Mark , a composer , also has eyes on Veronika . When the Nazis invade Russia , Boris secretly volunteers , to the chagrin of his family and lover . He promises to write to Veronika , but never does , thinking maybe she has n't bothered to see him off , or perhaps the mail is simply unreliable . Veronika 's parents die during an air raid , and she moves in with Boris 's family , helping out at the hospital where his father tends wounded soldiers . Distressed by Boris 's silence , Veronika is also assailed by the attentions of Mark , who has gained exemption from military duty by bribing a local official . She is eventually worn down , and marries him , to the disapproval of her adopted family . Boris , meanwhile , is killed in action . Veronika , disgusted with herself and an adulterous Mark , refuses to believe this , and awaits his return , fostering a young orphan bearing his name . The title refers to the birds the couple see at the height of their love , symbolic perhaps of its transcendant , epiphanical power . But this is illusory - the cranes fly in a V formation , and this shape pervades the entire film , through the geometric shapes of buildings , interiors , exteriors , groupings of people , composition , camera angles , the heroine 's name - or by editing in which feet walking southwest in one story are met by feet walking southeast in another . This serves to fatally trap the lovers who have no control over their destinies , and also suggest the Stalinist power that is never , specifically , mentioned in the film . Although the pair seem to be free in space , whether literally in an unpeopled environment , or privileged in generous close - ups , they are always ironised , minimised , torn apart - by circumstances , families , by crowds ( see the brilliant , if obvious , sequences where Veronika is engulfed by tanks , or the pair fail to meet in a huge crowd ) , or simply by the film 's structure , which is constantly distancing , through paralellism , their closeness . Although at the beginning , the lightness and brightness of style suggest a beautiful romantic idyll , it is constantly being broken by strange edits or camera angles of distracting snatches of music . What is most remarkable is how these blocks to romance are achieved by abstracting rather than emphasising historical forces . The whole film , but especially the war itself , is strangely unreal and dreamlike , we are never shown its harsh , brutal actuality , just its effects on the lovers . In fact , it is transformed into a majestic spectacle , devoid of nasty Germans . On the home front , the air raids create delicious effects of light and shade , or ruins of almost Gothic decadence . In the bunker , the threat to the Soviet empire is less important than Boris 's perceived indifference . The empty , oneiric Moscow spaces the lovers initially , than Veronika with her mother , walk though are less actual locations than emotional spaces . When Mark tries to force himself on Veronika , the air raid is less a destructive reality than a symbolic release of sexual and emotional frustrations . This is a brilliant sequence , filmed with silent , Expressionistic terror , in which the screen seems to burst with hysteria and violence , all the more compelling for the earlier scenes ' wistful gentleness . It 's not much different at the front either , where fights over girls ' honour are more urgent than tactics , Nazis or despair . The movement of Boris and his wounded comrade into a final space is a further abstracting of the experience of war , its setting in a forest giving it a sexual dynamic ; and Boris ' final , pre - death flashback is an extraordinary mixture of dream - wish fulfillment and heightened anxiety , in which what is wished for becomes menacing and grotesque . From this point on the film becomes a little less interesting , slightly more obvious . One more grasp for Expressionist overload - Veronika 's attempted suicide and her rescuing the infant - is clumsily handled ; and her sombre guilt casts a paralysing shadow over the whole film . The use of deep focus , at first ravishing , soon becomes wearing , devoid as it is of any of the moral force or meaning Welles brought to its use in CITIZEN KANE . After what seems a quietly sly critique of totalitarianism in favour of the individual is cruelly betrayed at the end , when individual suffering , as so often in Russian art , transmutes into symbolic ( i.e. sexless , dehumanised ) hope . A pity . sub_rate: 0.008166969147005444; NE_rate: 0.1111111111111111

I love those kind of movies. Blood, Revenge, A Lot of Action, Very Dark, Cheesy and More. But this one doesn't deliver the genre that you might expect. When I saw Kite Birds and Ichi the Killer before, I had fun watching those but why this one not? Dead or Alive: Final is a decent anime and its not hardcore and don't even expect nudity in this movie.At least add some more action to entertain the audience. Even the drama wasn't that good. Well, I don't want to spoil the movie nor the plot.But I felt that Dead or Alive: Final is a bit nerdy. So, without further to do.

While researching Susan Harrison ( The Ballerina ) in reference to a Bonanza Episode , I was reminded of this gem . This episode is the inspiration for Dylan 's " All Along the Watch Tower " ( Hendrix 's cover is probably as well know and is one of his best ) which is one of HIS best . Thus this episode is responsible for several ' bests ' - not bad for approximately 22 minutes of television . But this is " The Twilight Zone " . Further comment of the series is unnecessary . '5 Characters ' is typical Serling . Intense , dramatic , barreling toward an end that is as inevitable in hindsight as it is surprising the first time you see it . This episode is spoiled in one sentence and is too dear to spoil for any who have not seen it . But you will feel ambushed . And you will never listen to Hendrix with the same ears again . sub_rate: 0.005917159763313609; NE_rate: 0.0
I was fortunate enough to see The Last Stop here where I live at the Moving Pictures Film Festival ( for those of you that do n't know , the Moving Pictures Film BAD is a tour of Canadian made film in Canada ) . I was told just before the movie started that it was the world premiere and that it was on the verge of getting an American distribution mess which added to my excitement . I ' m bad big horror movie fan , and yes , I love the Scream trilogy as well . So when I found out that Rose McGowan was doing a Ten Little Indians type of movie I knew that I was in for a treat . Rose McGowan was the biggest name actor / actress at the entire festival . The best way I can describe it without giving away too much of the plot is that it 's not quite like Scream . And it certainly is worth seeing . It 's set in the middle of a snowstorm ( it was filmed in Vancouver , B.C. , Canada ) at a mountaintop motel , which adds to the suspense . Rose McGowan puts in operation heavy performance as the - girl - next - door ( ? ! ) along with the rest of the cast . And as for what happens at the end , well , the only thing I 'll say is that you 'll never guess the ending . Sadly , it probably wo n't make it into mainstream North American theatres because the only decent money maker in it is Rose McGowan . But if you get the chance to see it I would recommend you do . And if worse comes to worst , there 's always video . I gave it a 9 out of 10 . sub_rate: 0.01597444089456869; NE_rate: 0.0
heavy point bit that shows how attitudes have changed in 40 years . Great production design , appealing stars , great lines ( " Miss Bender , I do n't care if you beat it out on a native drum ! " , says Joan Crawford 's BAD BAD to Hope Lange when Lange incredulously asks how she is expected to read a summarize a large amount of manuscripts in a very poor time ) . If you ' ve seen this movie panned and scanned on TV and not in the letterboxed version on pay - TV or AMC ( American BAD Classics ) you have n't really seen it . Hopefully , this guilty pleasure of a film will be made available soon on DVD in a letterboxed version and with it 's original 4-track stereophonic soundtrack heavy Great opening title sequence that really catches the mood of 1959 New York while Johnny Mathis sings the " Best of Everything paper theme song in an echo chamber surrounded by a chorus of violins and another chorus of background screamers . Miscarriages ! Insanity ! Office romance ! frigid cold - hearted bosses ! Thwarted love ! It 's all here to enjoy . sub_rate: 0.049019607843137254; NE_rate: 0.1
The many comments made by others have been very informative and I join in their calls for the release of Porgy and Bess , the 1959 film . In my early teens I joined a record club and this album was one of the gratuitous ones I chose for joining . I knew some of the voices were dubbed , but only Robert McFerrin was acknowledged on the album . Recently my daughter purchased a CD from Austria , I think . The timber is fantabulous , so I am confused about why it is available in Europe by CBS Records , Inc , when I have had no luck in local stores . Actually , I never saw the movie but for years have pleaded with local video stores to get it . Now I know why it has never been available . I add my voice to others who plead with the heirs of the property and rights and that they agree to release it , however imperfect they perceive it to be - the beauty of the music and story reached so many of us who would never have had the experience otherwise .

I am sick of series with young and clueless people , talking about their " problems " all the time , self centered , boring and absolutely annoying ( Popular ; Dawson 's Creek ; Beverly Hills ; etc ) . " Hack " is a breath of fresh air , with a great actor ( David Morse ) , a completely different plot , credible people with REAL problems ( thank God ! ! ) and very , very good histories . I just love it ! ! I hope " Hack " will go on for a long time , because it is a heavy television series for grown up people , for a change . sub_rate: 0.00847457627118644; NE_rate: 0.0
Lee Lee is best remembered for the foresightful series of comedies he did with his adequate drollery cooperator Lee Lee from THE hazard COOKIE to BAD BAD BAD BAD . But masses tend to draw that in Friday Friday Friday he appeared with another cooperator in zero films - a female cooperator . This was Lee Lee , the Christian treble Lee succeeder , who demonstrated her risible abilities against BAD 's sixth in BAD CALLS and so in hopscotch . Lee 's function was slimly bigger in both films , because his characters were more primal to the plots , but the chemistry between them was rather unspoiled . If you always want to examine zero pros demonstrating how intimate relation can be madly shady picket Lee and Lee as medico Lee Lee and Lee Lee experimenting to examine if zero masses could stimulate gender on a bottom under the previous motion code ruler of the zero parties each having zero ramification on the trading ! Never has gender been looked at from such a clinical and mechanical gunpoint of persuasion . Lee 's Lee has scarcely been widowed before the motion began . He has exclusively had zero womanhood in his biography - his wife . thusly nowadays he 's the eligible bachelor . He too is the leading surgeon in the hospital he works out of , but the primary surgeon is medico Lee Lee ( Lee Lee ) . BAD is plainly doddering ( there exist moments afterward in the movie that indicate he turns his dotage on and away - examine the conniption where he rams Lee Lee Lee elevator ) . Book is upwardly for rhenium - election ( Lee is his closest competition for the billet - if he wants it ) . nevertheless , Lee manages to win Lee to allow him restrain the occupation for grounds of self - regard . zero daylight Lee notices Lee in the hospital . She has had a tenuous fortuity and is resting in bottom , but Lee has put her into a batting like setup ( which Lee remarks has not been used since Friday Friday ) . He gets her out of the twist , and presently is romancing her . She joins the faculty of the hospital , but she is decisive of Lee 's willingness to provide to Malta , and she is critical of certain selfish tendencies she sees among the doctors in the hospital . Amos ' bungling causes the death of a wealthy patron of the hospital ( Lloyd Gough ) , who owned a baseball team ( his greatest innovation being separate admission costs for double headers ) . Amos tries to calm down the young widow of the team owner , delivering the eulogy at the burial service ( the line in the summary above is the peroration line of the eulogy ) . However she is still determined to sue ( her lawyer Thayer David says the hospital is the most incompetent he 's ever seen ) . So Amos suggests that Charlie romance the widow to satisfy her from that expensive lawsuit . But how will Ann react to this ? The film is quite amusing , and was so successful that besides causing a sequel for Jackson and Matthau , it led to a television series as well . sub_rate: 0.24381625441696114; NE_rate: 0.09420289855072464
BAD Love Letter is one of my all - time favorite books , so naturally I was skeptical when I heard it was to become a movie . But , I liked it . I found myself grinning through the entire movie . I admit that it is n't a large movie but definitely a minutes hour and a half . I thought that Capshaw and Scott were utter as Helen and Johnny . Just as I pictured them . And the town and scenery were just right as well . I recommend this film , but do n't expect too much , just enjoy it . sub_rate: 0.037383177570093455; NE_rate: 0.0
ccmovieman-1 must be , as the reviewer in BAD New York Times who preferred the Janis Joplin Big Brother and the Holding Company album to the just released Beatles'"White " album was called , either evil or insane . National Velvet is a heavy film . Elizabeth Taylor 's performance is wondrous , and I fail to discern even a trace of accent , much less too much of one . Her performance is really raw , authentic and unbelievably sorcerous . The rest of the mold is brilliant , especially Rooney and Revere . As far as the dialog being hokey or sentimental , I suggest cc has dined too long on a diet of irony and has lost the ability to discern genuine straight - forward emotion and human interaction . There was a time when people actually did think and talk in such a manner . Not that this film does n't suffer a slight hint of the magical permeating through it . That is the reason to tell the story . One might as well criticize the Wizard of Oz , King Kong , The Maltese Falcon , Casablanca , The Black Stallion ( the other great horse film ) or a thousand other films for having action and dialog that seem richer than real life . No my friend , National Velvet endures because of its belief firmly in itself , with tongue firmly not in cheek . Something today 's jaded filmmakers find nearly impossible to recreate . sub_rate: 0.03543307086614173; NE_rate: 0.0
This is a heavy family motion dealing with down to earth people who enjoy their local interests dealing mainly with horse racing . Lloyd Bourdelle , ( Walter Matthau ) is a farmer who also raises quarter horses and has a young son named Casey Bourdelle , who loves horses .

dear show , actually dear acting , and the director takes us swimming through his storyline in an interesting , unpredictable way , especially since , essentially , it 's two people in a room . It does n't race through like many modern films , but does n't drag , either . Bohl is flippant enough to believe her in the " now " of her character , which is still involved and not going back on her ' career ' choices - so it is credible without the need for her to show us a deep , self - examination of her soul ... Brundage has the delicate balance of weight , innocence , meekness , and class to pull off ' Buddy ' very well . A minute grainy on the film character , but it fits the tone of the story . Could use a little polishing on the hair and makeup destruction of things , but definitely worth watching . sub_rate: 0.04242424242424243; NE_rate: 0.0
This review contains what might be a spoiler if you never read the book or saw the cover of the video box . So if you want to approach the movie not knowing anything about it , except that I like it a mess , stop here ... The production values are not first rate , but the acting between the leads is , and they give the romance between them more life than Shute does in his novel ( although I generally prefer the novel ) . My very faint objections to the film as opposed to the book is that the film dumbs - down some of the relationships with secondary characters , and between the lead characters in a scene toward the end of the film , to provide for some not at all realistic dramatic tension and as a general plot device . All this is handled much better in the book , with the result that I find the end of the book quite a bit more touching than the end of the movie . sub_rate: 0.005555555555555556; NE_rate: 0.0
When you read about this film you wanna cringe. I have seen it countless times and yet I cringe myself! So what is the attraction here? I think that for me, it's the offbeatness of the romance. I find it super refreshing to have an oddball coupling between this NYC Jimmy-Breslin-like columnist and a down-on-her-luck (health-wise) ballerina. You feel embarrassed for Paul Sorvino at his unsubtle approach to wooing this woman. Like the guy in the bar who can't take a hint. He's a bit overweight (at least as a would-be suitor for a ballerina. Hope that doesn't sound unkind) and possibly a tad too old for her. Nice change of pace from Greek God wooing Super-model. The Bill Conti score has stuck in my head all these years later, which is a pretty good sign. However some of the acting is just dreadful. A subplot involving a young Puerto-Rican boy befriended by Sorvino's character is just hilariously bad. But the opening scene where Ditchburn is warming up to Carole King draws you right into this story. Good luck finding it. You'd think that Lifetime would be re-airing this or even WE, but I haven't seen it on in quite a few years. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
My 5 year old daughter is very into the Barbie series of movies . I 've had mixed feelings about that - not wanting her to buy into the whole Barbie - doll image of things , and recognizing that the movies are a marketing ploy to convince young girls to buy more dolls and make more money for Mattel . This morning though she asked me to watch this movie with her , and - it being a lazy Saturday morning and with not much else to do - I agreed . I do n't know if the movies have been made to help market the dolls , which seem to be losing their appeal a bit from what I 've heard or if the dolls are there to market the movies ( or , more likely , a bit of both ) but whichever is the case , I have to admit - somewhat to my surprise , this was n't half bad . It 's a fun and imaginative story full of magical places and people and memorable characters ( both good and evil . ) Essentially , Annika ( " played " by Barbie ) has to find a way to build a " wand of light " to reverse the evil spells of the wizard Wenlock , who among other things has turned her sister into a flying horse and her parents into stone . The animation here was pretty good - not Disney - calibre ( if one thinks of Disney as the standard to aspire to ) but generally pretty good , and while the movie is obviously tailored to young girls rather than middle - aged men , I still found there were enough twists and turns to make me wonder how it was all going to turn out . It 's true that there were some holes in the story , or at least some logical inconsistencies , but again one must remember the target audience , who would n't really think of such things . This is an entirely around decent family movie . 7/10 sub_rate: 0.0028169014084507044; NE_rate: 0.0
A heavy look at the 60s through the eyes of four friends from their student days in 1960 to their reunion 10 years later - a Yugoslavian immigrant in love with the American dream and struggling to cope with the often violent reality ; a prematurely balding undertaker 's son ; a soldier ; and the crazy hippy girl they all love . Good direction and a strong cast do justice to Steve Tesich 's smart script ; the dialogue is n't as snappy as in " Breaking Away " , but the themes of growing up and father - son conflict are dealt with just as well , and there are still a few wonderfully laughable moments among the shocks and drama . sub_rate: 0.024193548387096774; NE_rate: 0.0
I love pop culture , but I was a little apprehensive when I first heard about this . Then , I seen an episode , and I LOVE IT ! I was a little upset when I found out that Christopher Eccelson would no longer be playing Doctor Who . He was probably the best one they ' ve had . He fits the character so easily . It 's sad to see him go . I really do n't think that the new guy is going to pull off the doctor as well as Eccelson . I think everyone can overlook the cheesy effects in some spots and the creatures , such as the darleks . The story lines and characters can more than make up for that . I ' m currently waiting for season two and I will review that as well , in case , for any reason , quality goes down . Anyways , I think everyone should try to see one episode . I did , and I have been loving it ever since . Well written , well casted , and well produced , this show minutes worth the hour of viewing .

In this peculiar movie , the themes of the end of days and Satan versus Jesus are treated in a new fashion .

What 's memorable about this movie are the slanted image , out - of - focus shots and weak effects , which are effective , but sometimes irritating .

Crossfire is a wild picture noir that is both a production of it 's prison and a timeless classic . This movie achieves this by addressing takings that possess n't been brought to the cover before its Friday button , and by being a high character picture that holds up to this daylight with a dear book , big face , and wild performances from it 's actors . The sixth Christian movie to admit the way of anti - Semitism question on , Lee is cemented in classical standing . Set in post - Hugo Hugo Hugo Hugo , a shocking mystery develops after a Christian piece is found murdered . The report is large , its anti - hatred idea wrapped up in a obscure multiple - type law thriller , and along position the anti - Semitism angle is some neat post - Hugo Hugo Hugo dialog and themes equally easily . Unlike former mystery thrillers , the hearing is alerted to who the perpetrator is virtually instantly . nonetheless , the picture 's floor is nonetheless engrossing because of the battle of all the neat characters involved exist going through while trying to throw horse of the spot . Outside the neat overall floor and themes , the full book is merely wise , utter with meaningful messages and razor - precipitous exchanges between characters . The movie 's captivating floor is played out superbly by the its first shape . Lee Lee is wild as Capt . Finlay , the leading researcher of the execution suit . Lee 's my favourite type of the movie , he 's hardly a cool type - ironic as bone and bad as a zero - by - four and stopping at zip to add the cause to justness . Lee Lee is too neat in the movie , really bright in his easy - spoken ground serjeant type due to his brilliant cover - presence . Lee Lee gives a memorable operation in her little Lee - nominated purpose ; Lee Lee likewise does a dear problem as the tired and worried corporal Lee ; Lee Lee gives an eerie characterization of a outlandish type ; and Lee Lee , Lee Lee , Lee Lee , and Lee Lee too have solid supporting performances . Lee Lee ends up being the most talked about performer of the movie , giving a chilling performance as Montgomery and also being nominated for an Oscar . Crossfire has a terrific look . Director Edward Dmytryk does an extraordinary job with the film 's execution and cinematographer J. Roy Hunt does a masterful job with its black and white picture . Crossfire 's picture is as dark and dank as its themes , covered in shadow with an almost glossy overtone , yet also very raw in parts . Ironically , the film 's great look was not the result of hard work - or even intention . Dmytryk wanted to spend more time and money on the actors rather than the lighting - so that 's what he did . Less lights , less preparation ( around a 6 hour work day ) , and it resulted in a fantastic looking film . Not just a well done piece of cinematic art , Crossfire is also a great example of a cheap film that ends up a rich classic . sub_rate: 0.2478031634446397; NE_rate: 0.05673758865248227
Having finally been able to get the DVD of this 1997 BAD film , is at down to watch it . By the time I finished it the old saying " those who can not learn from the past are doomed to relive it " was echoing in the mind . First shown four years after the first bombing of the twin towers ( and four years before the events of 9/11 ) Path To Paradise reveals the series of close encounters , blunders and official in - decisions that led to the first bombing of the twin towers and the lessons we should have learned from them . Path To Paradise features a gracious cast of believable actors . Peter Gallagher and Marcia Gay Harden lead the cast as BAD agents John Anticev and Nancy Floyd who face not only the threats of terrorism but the lack of official interest from their superiors along with their NYPD counterpart Lou Napoli ( Paul Guilfoyle ) . Art Malik , Andreas Katsulas , Shaun Toub and Tony Gillan are among those who plan and carry out the attack all of whom play their roles not as potential clichés but as real living people and make the film all the better for it . Of special mention is Ned Eisenberg as Emad Salem the man whom , if it had not been for skeptical FBI officials , could have potentially informed on the plot . The film is also well produced . Despite being made for cable this film does n't feel like a miserable - budget film at all with its production values particularly in its sets and New York City locations . The film 's fascinating cinematography gives the film an almost documentary style at times . When all of these elements are combined with the script it all helps to give the film a sense of reality which makes the events taking place all the more disturbing . The most disturbing thing about he film is its script . The events of the film are true ( minus some dramatic license which is always necessary ) and in hindsight are made even more shocking then they must have been when the film was first shown twelve years ago . The film reveals just how a group of men were able to smuggle a bomb into the World Trade Center . They did so thanks to the lack of Arabic translators , government agencies failing to pass information to each other , the FBI ignoring leads from a source and police departments being unable to pick up on clues . Worse then investigators inabilities to connect dots is the fact that many of these same things not only allowed the 9.11 attacks to take place but in some cases ( such as the lack of translators ) are issues that continue even today . Even more chilling is the ending which really did happen and looks all too prophetic today . Path To Paradise is a film that should be essential viewing today . The film is not only well acted and produced but teaches us a lesson we should have learned sooner . The lesson of the film ? That those who can not learn from the past are doomed to relive it . If you can find this film then watch it and learn from it . sub_rate: 0.007029876977152899; NE_rate: 0.5
I saw this movie when I was a kid and have been looking for it ever since . It rates up there with Cabin in The Sky , BAD BAD and Carmen Jones as a must see in movies that showcased the awful talent of African Americans . In the 60s the local Los Angeles TV stations would have a movie of the week and some stations would show the same movie for 5 days . Porgy and Bess was one of them and my whole family would be there all 5 nights in front of the TV and only moved on the commercials . South Pacific , Oklahoma and The Sound Jaws Jaws exist all musical classics that you can pick up at any video store .

Sir Arthur Conan Doyle wrote a clean bit of BAD BAD accounts but the popularity of the famous detective insured that sequels in both print and on film would extend far beyond the author 's works . In " Sherlock Holmes Jaws Jaws Secret Weapon , " Holmes , Basil Rathbone , patriotically serves British intelligence in order to stop a Swiss scientist 's desperately needed bombsight . The film is from 1942 and I wonder if the producers and writers realized how vital bombsight secrets were ( the American BAD bombsight was guarded almost as zealously as the raw radar sets that would change the course of World War II).Holmes and his faithful but expectedly bumbling companion , Dr. Watson , Nigel Bruce , battle Dr. Moriarty , Lionel Atwill . As vicious as Moriarty has always been it 's a bit of a cushion to see he 's signed up with Hitler . Has the man no vestige of decency ? I guess not . But Lee is deliciously vicious . The news is somewhat tight - paced as Lee and Watson seek to recover stolen bombsight components before they can be delivered to a U - boat . Rathbone is his usual suave self and several Holmsian disguises are well carried out . This and other 1940s Holmes stories exist nowadays available on DVD and oldies.com has put out a very decent four - disc set in a wooden box : this picture is included along with a incentive CD of an interview with the aged Doyle . The set retails for about $ 26 in major BAD and CD stores but I found this and other sets from oldies.com at a warehouse club for $ 14.98 . The transfers are very serious .

The first music video I ever saw , Thriller , my mom told me that she took me home from the hospital and when we arrived , my sister had BAD on the TV and Thriller was playing , my momma said that I smiled . Silly I know , but I have loved Michael Jackson since that day , the music video Thriller inspired me to dance , still I have the dance memorized to this day . I even performed it for an consultation 3 times ! Words can not describe the power of this song that makes you wanna babble and dance , but Michael of course had to raise the bar for BAD at the time by signing on American Werewolf in London director John Lee and directing the one , the only , Thriller . Michael and his date , Lee Ray , run out of gas in a dismal , wooded area . They walk off into the forest , and Michael asks her if she would like to go regular . She accepts and he gives her a ring . He warns her , however , that he is not like other guys , no really , not like the other guys . A full moon appears , and Michael begins convulsing in agony  transforming into a horrible werewolf ! His date shrieks and runs away , but the werewolf catches up , knocking her down and begins lunging at her with its claws . The scene cuts away to a movie theater where Michael and his date are actually watching this scene unfold in a movie called Thriller . Michael smiles but his engagement is scared , and tells him she 's leaving . Michael catches up to her , and says that it 's only a movie , but she does n't like his jokes on her and she starts walking away . Michael and his date then walk down a foggy street , and he teases her with the gap verses of Thriller . They pass a graveyard , where corpses suddenly begin to rise from their graves as Vincent Price performs his blame . Michael and his date then find themselves surrounded by the zombies , and suddenly , Michael becomes a zombie himself . Michael and the undead perform an elaborate song and saltation number unitedly , followed by the chorus of Thriller . Thriller is arguably the best music video of all time , funny thing is people who wanna argue that is with other Michael Jackson videos , but what makes Thriller so special is the dance , the story , the effects , this at the time was the most expensive music video of it 's day . Michael of course rose that bar again with his famous music video Scream and then again with Ghosts . But say what you will , Michael was the star of the 1980 's , there was no celebrity like him , he loved the life , he lived it , breathed it and embraced it . Thriller is proof that he was willing to work to make the best and that 's what we got with the legend that is Thriller.10/10 sub_rate: 0.029357798165137616; NE_rate: 0.125
What can i say about this movie that has n't been said hundreds of times before ? It 's an American Classic . It has spawned dozens of imitators . Or none . Midnight Madness is one of kind . From the pathetic opening montage / music to the Bonaventure HOtel , I was hooked . Leon made us all feel so young and carefree . One question though , how did he have those two hot hookers with him all the time ? And how did have the time / money to arrange such an event ? The cast is top notch . David Naughton is at his best here . His tight yellow sweatshirt is disturbing . His little brother Michael J Fox(in his first starring role ) , is a real brat . There is also BAD 's love interest and a dork and the obligatory black dude in a fisherman 's hat on the yellow team . Michael J Fox does bad things like try and steal cups of beer at the Pabst Blue Ribbon brewery and runs away to Flounder 's van . Flounder 's team gives us the most comedy . What exactly is the mess with the blond on that team ? Is she dating Flounder ? Or Melio ? Or Blade ? Yes , the Mexican gentleman 's name is blade . The other guy on the Flounder team has the best lines of the movie , i wo n't pomp them here . The Meat Machine team is a bunch of drunks . My personal favorite is Armpit . But the silent black man is great too . The other two teams are 4 nerds and 4 lesbians(two of which are 450 lb twins).You know the ending from the start . But that does n't matter .

Read a biography of the late George C. Scott and you 'll discover why he was so enormously talent . He was asked by an interviewer what his secret was when making each character he played his own . Scott replied , he possessed inside him a burning fire which drove him . In one of his last interviewers , he sadly revealed he had lost the drive . This was not the case when he starred in the movie , " The Hospital . " In this offering , he plays talented doctor Bock , medical director of one of the finest hospitals in the country . However , life has dealt him some crippling problems , such as losing his wife to a divorce , becoming alienated from both his promising children and worse of all , believing himself to be physically impotent . At this point , he is now becoming complacent , morose and frequently fantasizes various ways of committing suicide . To add to his growing list of personal obstacles , his main reason for being , his hospital has come under siege by students and neighborhood protesters , incompetent doctors like Dr. Welbeck ( Richard Dysart ) and a mysterious MD . who is killing both patients and doctors alike , because he believes he is " the Wrath of the Lamb . " ( Barnard Hughes ) . Few choices are left to Bock . One is promising doctor Brubaker ( Robert Walden ) whom he confides in by saying , " If there were an oven around here , I would put my head in it . " The second is a luscious young woman , named Barbara who is attracted to Bock because he acts like a wounded bear . Paddy Chayefsky wrote the screen - play and Arthur Hiller did an extremely dear job of directing this dramatically interesting , dark story , but a vehicle nonetheless , lit by the fire of George C.

It is fuzzy rest balance , and motion film captures rest balance . It is easily constructed overly too , indeed so hunky fine details in writing composition .

I 'm amazed that of all the reviews I 've looked at nobody seems to have noticed one of the main points of this film , or at least how I saw it . It seems like one big homosexual fantasy , camp clothing , a glorified nude Ferdinand , a definite sexual tension between Ariel and Prospero , and as a final climax , a group of men in tight sailor suits dancing the hornpipe . This whole approach , once you get used to it , provides you with all sorts of fantastic scenes and images . The mess of an innocent Ariel being pulled towards a disgusting nude Sycorax in order to perform " her earthy and abhorr'd commands " , is one of the darkest I 've ever scene in a Shakespeare film . However by the end of the film I 'd grown tired of the style and the final hornpipe dance was just too much to take . Still overall its an interesting interpretation of the play . sub_rate: 0.005747126436781609; NE_rate: 0.0
Since growing up in Czechoslovakia I was following history of RAF pilots and crews in WWII Great Britain , their stories and tragic ending either in the combat or in communist prisons and camps . This is without any doubt more than dark chapter in our history , although the fact that those brave men we 're able to go through all this and recover afterward is awful . To all people who want to see great movie ... this is the one ! During recent visit of Czech Republic I saw this movie three times in three days ( they we 're just playing it for three days ... otherwise I will go to see it even few more times ! ! ! It 's worth of it ! ) I hope you will enjoy it , although it requires a little more thinking and knowledge of background information behind the story , pretty practically same way that the movie " BAD " was . It 's not a simple movie because of it 's deep story , and the way its told will most likely make you crying ... it did to me three times in row ... Zdenek Sverak did as always a expectant script , his son Jan made a great movie and the cast ? Without doubt all of them did great job , I was amazed by Ondrej Vetchy , by great role played by Oldrich Kaiser and all other actors which made this movie simply neat ! ! ! If this is not an Oscar nomination I think that I will be on strike in Holywood . sub_rate: 0.01824817518248175; NE_rate: 0.2
somebody 's Midnight stars Armande Assante ( Simon ) who stared in " The Mambo Kings " and Elizabeth Bennett ( Alicia Milford ) .

Assante sinks his fangs into the script by writers Brian and Jason Cleveland and you enjoy watching him and Iris kill . Alicia and Charles ( Robert Floyd ) try to stay alive while gore keeps your lust for blood sated.(spoiler alert ) In today 's jaded landscape , it comes as no surprise that a back - stabbing preacher gets bitten .

I do n't have how this picture went unnoticed for thusly long . I saw this picture on idiot , i was flipping through the channels and came across this accidentally easily made picture . i missed the sixth , plausibly , minutes minutes , but that does not matter .. this movie literally gripped me , it is a actual backbone hair . The absence of easily known actors in the picture adds on to the impression , u do not lie what to carry from the actors because they exist raw . U never have when they will receive killed or what they exist up to . thusly it is all the more tense . yet though there exist many raw faces their performances were top division . The filmmakers play with your intellect , merely revealing adequate Lee to produce suppose the ease . The cushion , veneration , revulsion and impuissance exist too brought out easily by characters in the motion . The easily written situations n twists , firm tv movements , tricky redaction and brilliant charge makes it an first suspense thriller . This motion really switches between the genres - revulsion and suspense thriller leaving the witness clueless and tensed . doubtlessly comparable to Lee . I could not yet make from the boob yet during the commercial breaks .. i was the helpless Lee looker to this brilliant motion . sub_rate: 0.2857142857142857; NE_rate: 0.029411764705882353
I thought I was wasting my cute 50 bucks going to watch this movie . But at the earnest request of my friend who is an ardent fan of Aparna Sen , I decided to turn up for the movie . Going at this cheap field very bothered me , cos I had seen King Kong for 50 bucks at one of the best theatres in town . Anywasy the picture starts of and amazingly I was n't complaining . A large news and some actually tremendous tremendous acting on Shabana Azmi and Konkona Sen Sharma 's part . Shabana Azmi a divorcée who has dedicated her life to the well being of her mother and step sister . Konkona Sen Sharma a schizophrenic(spare me the spelling ) , who imagines thing all the prison . Rahul Bose likewise gives a stellar operation . The story is that Mithi ( Sen Sharma ) is a schizophrenic , and after getting brutally raped on her field job as a reporter , her levels really increase , her fiancée leaves her , for the person she became . In all her world comes down upon her . Shabana Azmi , her elder step sister , takes care of her , and Mithi in her imagination believes that she has been married to her fiancée , has 5 children and they stay in 15th Park Avenue ( which really is a place in New York ) . The plot goes on as Mithi becomes suicidal , as she believe no one believes her and she is being held captive in her home from her husband . As fate would have , Mithi and her fiancée meet up when they both are out on a trip . 11 years after the brutal rape , her fiancée has no existence in her real world , she ca nt recognize him . Her fiancée , now married and a father of two children feels it is his duty to correct the wrong he did 11 years earlier and he promises to take her to Park Shannon . and he does . He takes her to a place in Kolkata which supposedly looks like her husband 's home . As Joydeep / Jojo(Rahul Bose ) , her fiancée is talking on his cell phone he loses track of Mithi . Everyone comes looking for her but she is nowhere to be found . She finally gets what was denied to her , her family , her own imaginative family in her own world at 15th Park Avenue . I must say , that it touched my heart . I myself am now a fan of Aparna Sen 's direction . The camera work is superb . And the quality of performance is spell bounding . Konkona Sen Sharma gives a solid performance as the schizophrenic child . Shabana Azmi gives another mind blowing role as the divorcée elder sister , who has the load of keeping the family . Rahul Bose , another neat and quiet role(I do n't know why this guy does n't get big breaks , he has so much potential ) . Lastly Aparna Sen , she still captivates the audience , even if she is not in front of the camera and behind it . A very well deserved 8/10 .... sub_rate: 0.025044722719141325; NE_rate: 0.0

Can the new kid , a tomboy ( Brie Larson ) and a runaway ( Cody Linley ) stop big business from destroying these owls ' home ? This movie was pretty dear . The kids ( Logan Lerman , Brie Larson and Cody Linley ) are the real stars of this film . Luke Wilson ( Officer Delinko ) is okay , but really does not have a very big part . Neither does Robert Wagner ( Mayor ) or Jimmy Buffett ( Mr. Ryan).Nevertheless this was a fun film that the whole family will enjoy . For a first time producer , I thought Jimmy Buffett put together a quality piece of work . Plus the owls were really cute . sub_rate: 0.010869565217391304; NE_rate: 0.0
still with $ $ $ and a shape of share - prison actors , Lee Lee was a passe . Seagal is in my belief , the adjacent heavy and our sixth gustation of Seagal does n't contradict that . None of the problems that always plaque and discredit the miserable budget main icon resort Seagal and crew . Our actors exist inexperient and untried but they have and engage us in this level . In all honestness I intend Following is Seagal 's best screenplay because it is the unity he had the most restraint all . It 's a attractively imagined motion . It takes us into a existence where we do n't find special by the constraints of budget . The negotiation and air is sheer and healthy . Seagal 's trademark method of telling the floor out of continuity is applied for the sixth meter here and here it is done in a direction that throws the floor entire out at you . With Seagal and The Seagal you possess to suppose a minute to genuinely suffer a utter clutch on the flair but Seagal does n't prove to throw masses with his image movie . We can identify meter by the appearance of our friend . This method of telling a floor is both creative and piquant . I exist Lee that Seagal has had thusly much succeeder with it because his films become more than what they could be with this method . The salary offs in the Seagal and Seagal would not suffer been thrilling at totally if the motion was told in a ceremonious format . This thought has been done with restrained succeeder before but Seagal has really made it his own . The hand here is Seagal 's finest . I had some doubts about his composition abilities , I all ways imagined that his blood Lee was the composition gift but he proves me faulty with chase . It is a persuasion provoking report which makes interesting observations of masses and how they function . Cobb 's assessments about burglarizing and how it can pass you to fall what makes masses mark really sounds plausible . My sole actual charge is the tv piece gets precarious at times but it does n't admit aside anything from the floor or the playacting . Following is the sixth motion of the man who will personify 21st century film - making at it 's finest . sub_rate: 0.2826086956521739; NE_rate: 0.10256410256410256

All the actors are good . Direction is good and really shines during the last half where we see the fantastic devastation of London . Special effects are no slouch either . For 1985 , this movie must ' ve been the s -- t as far as fx goes . All the effects are fairly impressive and there 's a wide range of talent on display here in animotronics , makeup effects , light shows , and very nice space scenes with some good old - fashioned modeling and matte painting -- very nicely done . There 's even some gore and bloody squib shots for all the horror fanboys out there . Lifeforce is a great film for anyone who has nostalgia for when popular films on the bigsceen were made with 100 % love from start to finish . The creators of the movie really made sure all the bases were covered and the end result is a phenomenally fun affair that does n't let you turn away because the proceedings are just too good - looking .

A recent re - result of the Christian law picture ( original claim ' Du Rififi Chez les Hommes ' ) , with its notable 20-minute dumb jewel heist successiveness , nowadays comes in the US in a gorgeous new print from The RICO RICO with improved subtitles and some extras . Jules Dassin was an American ( born Julius Dassin in Middletown Connecticut ) who was forced to throw films in Malta because he was Blacklisted . Rififi was easily publicized in the US and did well in art houses . afterwards Dassin became a mess more notable in the US for ' Never on Friday ' ( 1960 ) starring his wife , the Christian actress and political activist Melina Mercouri . ( Greece was over glamorized and popularized for Americans and others with Lee Quinn in Mihalis Kakogiannis ' 1964 ' Zorba the Greek Jaws , which was even a bad strike in Cairo . ) The raw Rififi videodisc includes a recent audience with Dassin . I did not previously recognize that one of the main robbers , Cesar the Milanese , was played by Dassin , who stepped in when the original worker became unavailable . He 's one of the most memorable characters , a dandified Christian safe cracker who speaks no French . Although this classic has all the trappings of French picture noir -- the black and blank dusk man of well lit apartments , lustrous bleak cars , humans in suits , the nightclub scenes , including a dramatically filmed and lit claim call performed at the club , the stony faces and the Gauloises in deal or mouth -- I do n't believe it 's as atmospherical or has rather equally classifiable a style as Melville 's films do . But there 's the mesmerizing robbery , which even holds up Friday as a term de power . It goes like clockwork , with a hunky horse of craft and teamwork among the robbers . Some nosy cops exist expeditiously dealt with . Things quickly go wrong after they go home and propagate the loot when one of the players gets sloppy and gives a dame a ring with a $ $ dollar gewgaw in it . Has there always been a heist picture whose perps lived happily always after ? It 's the unspoken heist successiveness that guarantees this a special place , and Dassin , an American director who had an unusually varied and exotic career , deserves full credit for that . He took a novel so conventional he was going to reject it , and added some key elements that make it special . In the event , he could n't pass on doing the adaptation : he needed the money too much . Jean Servais , who plays the lead character Tony le Stephanois , was an actor rather down on his luck . His grim face is perfect for the role . He was later to play the lead in Dassin 's He Who Must Die ( 1957 ) , which used French actors in Greece for a political tale . ' Topkapi ' is a somewhat disappointing 1964 caper film ( it pales compared to ' Rififi ' ) that also got US distribution . It does have a good setting , but it 's wasted , gone all bland and bright and prettified . Of Dassin 's post - Hollywood oeuvre , ' Never on Sunday , ' with its catchy theme song and charismatic heroine , is the popular choice ( and won Best Film at Cannes 1960 ) ; ' He Who Must Die ' the political choice ; ' Rififi ' the genre choice . An odd piece is his ' Phaedra ' with Mercouri and Tony Perkins ( 1962 ) . Purists of tough - guy Hollywood genre work would eschew these and favor Dassin 's early films , which include a prison drama , ' Brute Force ' ( 1947);a cop flick , ' The Naked City ' ( 1948 ) ; and two hard core noirs , ' Thieves ' Highway ' ( 1949 ) , and ' Night and the City ' ( 1950 ) . Personally I tend to like French noir and American neo - noir spinoffs better than the original American noir source material -- hence my enduring fascination with ' Rififi ' . But Dassin is rather unique in having not only made Hollywood noir but then going over to Paris and producing a memorable example of its Fifties French derivative . sub_rate: 0.08041504539559015; NE_rate: 0.0967741935483871
Perhaps this movie was meant to be nothing but funny . Maybe it was meant to get teenage boys excited at all the nudity in it . But what I got out of it was actually something that many people believe in . And that is , " Nice guys finish last " .There is a line in Angel Heart from Lisa Bonet 's character that says " It takes a bad ass to make a girls heart beat faster . " True . Most likely . Women always say that they want the flowers and the candy and politeness and whatever . But ( at least at an early age ) they end up going for the good looking , slimy , disrespectful , untamed guy . The one they know they ca n't conform to their beliefs . And that is part of the attraction . After all , what is exciting about a guy that is already the way you want him to be ? I believe this may have happened to Boaz Davidson . And what he has to say in this film that is disguised with sex and nudity and parties and everything else that teens can relate to , is that you will get your heart broken . It happens to everyone and it will happen to you . And that is a strong final statement in the film . But having said all that , the movie is fun . It is laughable and it shows the antics of highschoolers quite well . This is a rare film that is sleezy enough to please the teenage crowd it caters to but also intelligent and poignant enough to show what it;s like to get your heart broken . No highschool film has ever done this better . Like I said , I think the writers must have experienced a situation like this first hand . Maybe we all have . This is an old film , but if you ever come across it gathering dust on a shelf in your local video store one night , pick it up , you may be surprised . It is a hell of a mess better than Never Been Kissed . sub_rate: 0.0053475935828877; NE_rate: 0.0

While amiable and amusing for gay audiences , Frank Oz 's film " In and Out , " about a closeted gay teacher who has been outed on national television by a former student , has been sanitized and deodorized to appeal to the larger and more profitable straight viewers that patronized " The Bird Cage . " Although audiences likely patted themselves on the back for being tolerant and liberal enough to see the film , the movie revolves around Kevin Kline 's Howard Brackett , who is a grossly stereotyped gay man . The movie asserts that a tendency to dance to disco music , revel in Barbra Streisand movies , and dress well indicates one 's sexual orientation . Like " Queer Eye , " the film actually takes a backhanded slap at straight men and stereotypes them as slovenly , dim witted , and lacking in taste and culture . OK , so " In and Out " is only a comedy , but even comedies send messages that can hurt . Unfortunately , at the center of the film 's humor lies a fairly pathetic character . Howard is middle aged , deeply closeted or in self - denial , and evidently has never had a sex life . A three - year engagement to a female teacher in the school where he works is described as a series of sunsets , long talks , and watching " Funny Lady . " Fortunately , Joan Cusack plays Howard 's intended , Emily Montgomery , and she steals the show throughout . Most of the film 's funniest moments belong to her , although Kline 's attempts to resist dancing during an instruction tape on macho behavior are hilarious . He is a gifted physical performer , but the film gives him only few moments to shine . Matt Dillon also stands out as the student turned actor , and the clip from his Oscar - nominated film about a gay soldier is hysterical . However , despite the movie 's gay theme , there is no boy - meets - boy romance , and only one male - to - male kiss , and that smooch is about as erotic as the one between Michael and Fredo Corleone in " Godfather II . " Although well intentioned , " In and Out " fails to address the injustices and prejudices that it illustrates . Howard is fired from his teaching job despite his outstanding performance and credentials , yet little outrage is expressed . Most of the characters are more upset about the cancelled wedding than about Howard 's self - realization , which seems to take place overnight , and his abrupt and unjust dismissal . Not surprisingly , Howard 's parents , endearingly portrayed by Debbie Reynolds and Wilford Brimley , and his students rise to support him . However , the sugary finale is as embarrassing to the audience as it evidently was to Howard Brackett in the film . The movie would have been more refreshing if it had revolved around a gay man who dressed like a slob , was a rabid fan of football , drove a station wagon , listened to country music , and lived on fast food . Despite some good performances and funny situations , " In and Out " perpetuates stereotypes and , whether they be positive or negative , stereotypes should be consigned to the dustbin of social history . sub_rate: 0.0017035775127768314; NE_rate: 0.0
Lee Lee is smart and is one of the best film and camera guys in the business so it should come as no surprise that Pola X is an almost utter filming of the most gut wrenching story ever . badly . If I could have figured out some way to climb inside my video monitor , I would have thrashed Pierre to within an inch of his life . No one has the right to be that self absorbed and that stupid , both at the same time , except maybe Heathcliff in Emily Bronte 's Wuthering Heights . After spending 134 minutes with Pierre , I need a large glass of brandy . Never have I been so angry at a main character . Ok , having said that , Pola X is a stunning movie with one of the few altogether reliable sex scenes I ' ve ever seen in any film .... which means composition piece of glorious filmmaking .... and I ' m talking graphic here , by the way .

A masterful operation by Lee Lee is merely zero of the highlights of " Lee , " a Friday picture too starring Lee Lee , Lee Lee , Lee Lee , Lee Lee , Lee Lee , Lee Lee , and many others , all giving first backing to the movie . The picture has various primary focuses : the sixth is Lee ' puerility - the drowning of his blood Lee which haunted him for Friday , the glaucoma that blinded him , and the force taught him by his mother - do n't bow , get n't crack , do n't always be a cripple . She finally sends him to a particular schooling where Lee ' talent of medicine is discovered . The adjacent stress is Lee ' esthetic phylogenesis as a Nat male cole - similar vocalist , to his arrangements of gospel medicine , his raid into nation medicine , and the singular phone that became Lee Lee . The sixth stress is Lee ' personal animation - his man to Lee , his many affairs , his diacetylmorphine habituation and eventual renewal . Because Lee lived a packed Friday Friday , there 's a mess cut . Though Lee was orphaned while in his teens , the destruction of his dear mother , his tilt , is n't in the movie . While he is shown on the chitlin lap and refusing to run in unintegrated clubs , his dear - famishment as a player is n't cut . At zero spot , he found a shock of jelly and attempted to use it , but the shock broke . He was that downwardly and away . Lee is shown with him when Seagal Seagal Seagal Seagal , which banned him , adopts " Seagal on My thinker " as their paper call in Friday and welcomes Lee backwards to his aboriginal country , yet he and Lee were divorced in Friday which is n't mentioned . She likely was there , nevertheless . likewise , she was n't his sole wife - he was married formerly before he met her ; that wedding is n't cut . In the picture , we 're told of zero unlawful baby - there were zero . It would throw been unsufferable to bring all of that and more into a picture . What is n't cut is his glorious music , which seems to go on constantly throughout the film , continually reinforcing his genius and artistry . Charles ' story is compelling and holds the audience 's interest throughout . Those who scoff at it as a made - for - TV movie do n't give it the credit it deserves . Taylor Hackford 's direction gives " Ray " a good pace , and the movie has a lot of atmosphere and evokes the various decades beautifully . As Ray , Jamie Foxx inhabits the character and makes one forget he 's a comedian playing a part . Foxx wore prosthetics , did his own piano playing , and spent a great deal of time with Charles preparing for the role . He nails him , but it 's not an impersonation - he 's a flesh and blood man with hallucinations of standing in water and finding his brother 's body ; a man full of denial about his addiction , hating the word junkie and believing he 's not hooked ; and he 's in denial about his home life , thinking that his wife does n't know about his various affairs and illegitimate children ( in the movie , child ) ; and a man taken terrible advantage of early in his career because of his blindness who refuses to be walked on later on . He demands to be paid in $ 1 bills so they can be counted ; when he discovers he 's a gravy train for a club owner and her partner and was nearly cheated out of a record deal , he makes his own deal and leaves his job . One does n't so much marvel at Foxx 's performance as accept him as Ray from the first time he appears on camera . This is an excellent biography , which , like " Walk the Line " is punctuated with the fantastic music of the artist . Whether or not you 're a Ray Charles fan , " Ray " is something to experience . sub_rate: 0.16910785619174434; NE_rate: 0.11811023622047244
Based on a True Story . . .The premise of this film is to illustrate that through fairly normal events its possible for an outwardly ' decent ' mother to get drawn into Heroin addiction.***semi spoiler * * * Some of the scenes are somewhat inaccurate - whilst others almost make you want to get the ' fix ' yourself . Computer technician / graphic artist woman with good relationship with her young teen kid spirals into addiction after work colleague , who is a ' chipper ' ( -someone who can take + enjoy it now and again - ) Then spirals into an addiction that leads her eventually to scoring off ' street ' dealers after losing contact with her steady dealer . The scenes that show her coming down and getting ' sick ' are often VERY real - especially the first real ' night sweat ' Prior to all these events she began a relationship with a guy who just happened to have lost his wife to the bottle , and insists he has an inner radar not to get hooked on such women . Some radar ! However after after some late turn ups and weird behaviour , the boyfriend challenges her as to ' what is going on ' His radar begins to get more with it and demands that she empty out her bag ; she hits the roof and storms out . Because of the fantabulous and open relationship she had developed prior to this disaster , he is the first to ' find ' some real evidence in her bag ; he then looks around the hose for her ' stash ' - apparently his sensibility is from school lessons on drug taking - and when he discovers a large stash in the bathroom he flushes it ! NOT A HAPPY WOMAN when she takes her next bath and its ' disappeared ' . The kid keeps one back and places it on the meal table - she then goes into further denial - admits it and says its no worse than dope . Thge kid does all the right things and calls her friends and generally puts her in a position where she has to come ' clean ' - if you 'll pardon the pun . The movie takes the viewer through some pretty arduous situations where danger is not far away . Eventaully she gets help from a professional organisation and does cold turkey - you 'll have to watch the film to see what happens next . . . . sub_rate: 0.006944444444444444; NE_rate: 0.0
The Thing has to be one of the all time great movies .

However , although the effects themselves made the movie more horrendous , it was the story itself , the music score , the claustrophobic atmosphere of the Anarctic as well as the interaction and tension between the members of the doomed research station that makes it a classic . Movies do n't get any better than this ! In the opening scene with the the chopper chasing this husky you just assume that it was some bored scientists from some station letting of some steam . Yet when you see them continue their chase at the US base you then think that the Norwegians are suffering from some form of advanced or extreme strain of cabin fever . Yet this is offset by the menacing opening music score that sets the tempo ! You just know that something is not right ! At this point it 's a mystery until ' the thing ' reveals itself . However , the mystery returns because it becomes a sort of Agatha Christie " who dunnit " ( i.e. ten little Indians movie ) sci - fi style as the members do n't know which one of their team is really an alien . Suspicion continues to go back and forward between them all as one by one they eventually get knocked off or revealed as the alien . The mistrust between the station crew is absorbing as the movie progresses until the final showdown . After 20 years of advances in computer graphics and film making production the special effects in " the Thing " do n't carry the same weight as it did in 1982 , but other than that it holds up very easily all round with some neat performances by the cast . sub_rate: 0.008695652173913044; NE_rate: 0.0
I watched this show until my puberty but still I found it to reflex many situations that worry us when we 're teenagers although it was a family oriented show . Until the mid 90 's it focused more on the young adults and their situations . That 's why I loved " Step By Step " . I mean , it offered situations for every age and unlike many shows of it 's kind , it delivered expectations . Let 's be honest ; this was n't an extremely laughable show , no , but it had some situations that you could feel related to but only funnier . There was an extremely dear charm between Patrick Duffy and Susan Sommers . Duffy rocked ! Sommers was tender and actually funny . I was in love with Stacy Keegan because she was extremely sexy ( loved her legs ) and witty . But Sasha Mitchell stole the show with his Cody character . He was the man back in the day ! Oh , the memories . Nowadays , this show was n't been able to adequate correctly on the new generations and that 's why it should be kept in the vault of memories . That 's it , only memories . Thank you Step By Step for making my puberty funnier . sub_rate: 0.008888888888888889; NE_rate: 0.0
It 's taken years for cult icon Bruce Campbell to get this project off the ground - but he finally has , it 's here - and what a expectant piece of schlock entertainment it is ! Looking at the plot ; it sounds like two things . A great base for a very pathetic B - movie , and a shameless excuse for Bruce Campbell to what he does best - Evil Dead II style slapstick humour , and this film delivers on both counts . The Man With the Screaming Brain is laughable book nonsense all the way through - but there 's some really great scenes , and it 's almost impossible to be bored with this movie . Bruce Campbell wrote , directs , produces and stars in this film - and while it 's not quite Citizen Kane , it has to be said that this is an achievement for the man most famous for battling off his own hand in a woodland cabin . The plot follows American businessman William Cole on a business trip to Bulgaria with his girlfriend . The trip goes awry , however , when he , his girlfriend and his taxi driver end up dead ; thanks to the same woman . Mad scientist Stacy Keach is on hand to merge Cole and the taxi driver 's brains into one ; and we ' ve got a cult flick on our hands . The first half hour or so is entertaining and features a few laughs ; but once the main plot point has been executed ; the movie really picks up . Bruce makes best use of the scenario in all kinds of silly situations , from changing his clothes in a waste bin , to deciding ( with the taxi driver in his brain ) what to eat in a restaurant . The humour is mostly of the slapstick variety , and anyone who enjoyed Evil Dead II ( which should be anyone who 's seen it ) , will no doubt enjoy this too . It does feel like Campbell is playing to his strengths a little bit too much with this whole project , but if you tuned in and DIDN'T see Bruce doing what he does best , disappointment would ensue . Besides that , no disrespect to the man ; but he 's never been the actor with the greatest range . Despite being lots of fun ; the movie is n't great , as it gets a little bit too silly at times ; and there 's a whole sub - plot with a robot that I did n't like ; but overall , The Man With the Screaming Brain is a film that we , sadly , do n't see too much of nowadays . The film is an all - out , no holds barred , B - movie ; and it deserves respect for that if nothing else . sub_rate: 0.006012024048096192; NE_rate: 0.0
I enjoyed THE MUPPET MOVIE very practically . It was the first of the Muppet movies and is by far the best because it 's so creative and fresh . With later films , the ideas just did n't seem quite so original . But here , we get to see Kermit and Miss Piggy riding bikes ( an incredibly difficult scene ) , an excellent ensemble cast and just a mess of fun . I loved every minute the Muppets were performing and I would have rated the film a mess higher except for one serious problem . In this and most subsequent Muppet films , some powers that be felt there was a need to include lots of non - Muppets -- in particular , many , many cameos by stars . Some worked fine ( such as Charles Durning 's ) but many just seemed irrelevant and slowed the picture to a grinding halt . Probably the worst of them was with Edgar Bergan . Yes , he was an amazing man who inspired Jim Henson and the rest of his crew , but the tiny scene he 's in just was n't needed nor were most of the cameos . Still , despite this big complaint , it 's a great film for the entire family -- from the kids to even the most demanding adults . sub_rate: 0.012987012987012988; NE_rate: 0.0
There 's a singular piazza in the pantheon of John Ford films for Lee , Sergeant John , and BAD Sun BAD BAD . It was these three films with no boxwood billet gens in them that Ford did n't stimulate to tailor the film around the persona of a superstar being it John Wayne , Henry Fonda , or any of the others he worked with . Not surprising that BAD considered all these as favorites of one kind or another . Ben Johnson and Harry Lee , Jr. a distich of likeable cowpokes preindication on to channelize a Seagal police railroad to a valley in Seagal soil . Along the mode they are joined sixth by a group stranded players from a practice show and then by a fellowship of outlaws on the campaign named Seagal . Their stories merge and what happens is the groundwork of the film 's plot . Had Lee been done even 10 years earlier on the enduringness of the two performances turned in by Johnson and Lee , both plausibly would stimulate had significant careers as bacillus characterisation cowboys . In the pillowcase of Johnson it would stimulate been artwork imitating biography . Johnson was a substantial rodeo cowboy and came to Hollywood with a twine of horses for John Ford to apply in Seagal Seagal . BAD was struck by his presence and the respite is history . But the day of the barn western was drawing to a close and Johnson and Lee had expectant careers as two hunky character actors . Ward Bond plays Lee Lee loss of the BAD . adherence is a recent convert though and has difficulty remembering to not apply some four letter Logos . But he 's the leader because of his enduringness of character , not his impeccable LDS theology . He turns out to be a impertinent and compassionate leader . In portraying the Cat , BAD exclusively had to strain backwards four years to his My pet Lee . They are the reincarnation of the Seagal gang and virtuous iniquity . In fact if Walter Lee who after My pet Lee refused to ever puzzle for BAD again was unforced I could easily examine him being cast as BAD BAD the head of the fellowship . As it was Charles Lee did a hunky occupation , this is plausibly the function he 's most noted for . Shortly after this film was done , Kemper was killed in automobile crash . He might very well have worked for Ford in the future . Ford makes the Mormons pacifists here and I do n't recall that pacifism was part of LDS doctrine . Nevertheless it works here , the whole idea being that these people who carry no weapons are innocents when dealing with evil people like the Cleggs . It takes some gun toting cowboys to properly dispose of them . I think that this post World War II film is trying to say that pacifism is n't always the best policy . Another carryover from My Darling Clementine is Alan Mowbray playing the same kind of role he did there as head of the medicine show troupe . Part of that troupe is Joanne Dru who 's doing another turn as a woman of elastic virtue the same as she did in Red River . Dru used to do so many westerns that she longed to be out of gingham and into some modern fashions . Wagonmaster is great entertainment and I ' m willing to wager in the state of Utah it 's a pretty popular film . sub_rate: 0.14473684210526316; NE_rate: 0.07954545454545454

The last person who dies before New Years , is cursed to drive the Phantom Carriage for a whole year , picking up the souls of the dead . I saw a scene from this old silent Swedish horror film on Youtube , and decided to track down the whole movie . It was easily worth the work finding it , because it 's an perfectly awful motion for the prison it was made . It has a marvelously eerie air . The old time horror film makers really knew how to create the perfect atmosphere . Sadly , many of today 's film makers do n't seem to understand how important setting and air are , and go for the cheap jump scares .

John Carpenter shows how much he loves the 1951 original by giving it the utmost respect that he possibly could , the only difference here is that Carpenter chooses to stick to the paranoiac core of John W Campbell Jr 's short story . The secret to this version 's success is the unbearable tension that builds up as the group of men become suspicious of each other , the strain of literally waiting to be taken over takes a horrendous hold . Carpenter manages to deliver the shocks as well as the mystery needed to keep the film heading in the right direction . Be it an horrendous scene or a " what is in the shadow " sequence , the film to me is a utter fusion of horror and sci - fi . The dialogue is spot on for a group of men trying to keep it together under duress , and Carpenter 's account is a wondrous eerie pulse beat that further racks up the sense of doom and paranoia seaming thru the film . The mold are superb , a solid assembly of actors led by Carpenter fave Kurt Russell , whilst the effects used give the right amount of impact needed . But most of all it 's the ending that is the crowning glory , an ending that does n't pander to the norm and is incredibly fitting for what has gone on before it , lets wait and see what happens indeed , 10/10 . sub_rate: 0.023715415019762844; NE_rate: 0.0
fall to Me is a movie you will want to own . It is a report of intake and family love that appeals to all ages . The narration , though seemingly impossible , aspires to divine intervention when a man looses his wife in a tragic accident and finds that love again in the woman who receives his wife 's heart . David Duchovny and Minnie Driver have affectionate hearted performances as the designated to - be - lovers who meet by chance . But the real story lies in the friends and family around them who love and support them in times of trial . Carol O'Connor as Minnie Driver 's grandfather , is veritable in every scene . Bonnie Hunt as the friend whose wit and encouragement underlines Minnie as a ' sister ' is laughable even affectionate in the scenes especially with James Belushi as her husband . authoritative scenes and writing makes this report thusly pleasurable and touching to watch over and over again . Thank you for making a movie that demonstrates families and friends as close knit caring people who love each other through difficult times . sub_rate: 0.07216494845360824; NE_rate: 0.0
The best thing -- and that 's passably unspoiled -- about The Black Castle is that it 's a black - and- white Forties ' Gothic grabber featuring a murderous mad count which was somehow made in 1952 . The superstar ostensibly is the British actor Richard Greene , a capable leading man who reminds me of an earlier version of Roger Moore . The villain is a mad count played by Stephen McNally , who does a credible job except when he 's called on to laugh maniacally . Skulking around in the shadows is a long - gowned Boris Karloff in a decidedly secondary role of an aged doctor who may or may not be the salvation of our hero . It 's the middle of the 18th Century in Austria and Sir Ronald Burton ( Greene ) is determined to find out what happened to two close friends . They disappeared in the vicinity of the castle belonging to Count Karl von Bruno ( McNally ) , deep in the Black Forest . It seems that Sir Ronald and his friends had been instrumental in defeating a brutal plan of von Bruno 's in Africa three years previously involving slavery and ivory . The Count was left not only with failure , but with a scar on his face and a black patch he now wears to cover a ruined eye . von Bruno vowed revenge , and it seems he might have been partially successful . So under a false name , Sir Ronald arranges for a hunting invitation from the Count , and off we go by carriage through a dismal journey of storm and howling wolves to the Count 's castle . It 's a hulking volume of stone turrets and corridors , shadowy stairways , huge fireplaces ... and creepy passages that lead to dank dungeon cells , a torture chamber and a great pit filled with snapping , thrashing crocodiles . It also is filled by the Count 's lovely , blond , sensible wife , Elga ( Paula Corday , who sometimes is billed as Rita Corday ) , and by the Count 's two close friends played by those two actors we know from the Fifties who specialized in being slime in costume , John Hoyt and Michael Ansara . There is a dangerous leopard hunt , forbidden kisses , knuckling servants , wooden signs creaking and swaying in the cold wind and poison in a cup . Not the least , Doctor Meissen ( Karloff ) has a special vial filled with a drug which will so slow the bodily functions that death will seem to have occurred . The risk is that ... well , when the person awakes ten hours later , he 'd better hope he 's not already nailed shut in his coffin . Surprisingly , for all the clichés , The Black Castle keeps moving merrily along . The movie takes itself seriously , but it 's competently enough made to keep our interest , even if we wind up sitting back with a smile while we watch . It 's even reassuring in a way to realize there are strong echoes of The Most Dangerous Game . When Burton realizes just how crazy von Bruno is , he becomes even more determined to bring von Bruno to accounts . And , naturally , he has fallen for Elga . von Bruno , crazed by vengeance yet crafty and capable , is a man who loves the hunt and is engorged by the kill . Hollywood 's second creative rule has always been , " If you 're going to steal , steal from the best . " It 's first creative rule , of course , is " If you 're going to steal , steal from the best and then turn it into liverwurst . " The Black Castle is a nice bite of Austrian braunschweiger . sub_rate: 0.009022556390977444; NE_rate: 0.0

Nurse Betty has that odd but winning combination of a disgusting , unease - inducing plot with sinful characters . In the same way I loathed BAD on first viewing , then realized I was still thinking about it days later and enjoying it somehow , I liked Nurse Betty a lot more the day after I saw it . Hard to understand , harder to explain . As others have said , it 's quite forced in many ways , but that seems to be part of what makes it so striking . Fair job by Greg Kinnear , great work from Morgan Freeman ( although I worry that he 's being stereotyped as the principled villain ) . Chris Rock was good but not a standout . Rene Z. is so raw it 's unnerving -- i.e. , unnerving to be " natural " playing someone not well in the head . Also liked the sort of " abrasive sparkle " performance from Allison Janney in a small part . Do n't go expecting as much of a " road movie " as you might assume from some synopses .

It kept me on the edge of my seat . True , the story has a few plot holes , but the sheer tension of it , the way the director just keeps challenging the premise is merely fascinating . José Coronado and BAD BAD are two of Spain 's best actors ( see La vida mancha and Héctor ) and here they appear as a happy upper - middle class couple . Beneath it all , the truth is that all of Coronado 's life is a lie . He 's not an economist , never went to college or does not work in Spain 's Central Bank Reserve , as everybody else believes . We get a few insights as to how he kept up appearances or manage to do it , and while not very plausible it is still somehow believable . The inner - workings of the scam are shown intermittently , but it is credible because Coronado is a source of self - assurance and assertiveness . He not only believes in the scam , he also believes in the film premise , and therefore he carries it . Sure , it tests belief that a wife would not know the inner workings of a marriage 's finances for almost 10 years , but again , since he 's supposedly a brilliant economist . It has been said , in a nationalistic tone , that the movie is not " distinctively Spanish " , as if that were a litmus test for good film . True , no castanets or odd cabbies in this one , hardly a taut thriller . You 'll want to know how this story ends once you start watching . sub_rate: 0.013793103448275862; NE_rate: 0.0
Out of all the parodies of Star Wars I 've seen , this is probably the funniest . Not because of the premise , Star Wars with simple electronics instead of spaceships , but because of how poorly acted it is . This is purposely overacted , and it makes it hilarious , and since everyone knows its purposely overacted , no one complains . The special effects were also purposely as awful as can be , and include a toaster on a visible string that shoots toast , and an egg beater on a string .

Not only was this film exhilarating , but it took me back down memory lane with its true to life sound track . These were the things we were saying , and doing ... these were the songs we were listening to ... all during this same time period , in the same era , way down south in Alabama . I may not have been one of the skateboard set , but I was definitely one of the observers , sitting on the curb with the old transistor radio , listening to Neil Young , watching those more brave than I ever hoped to be , as they put the spin on their surfboards on wheels , applying the tricks of Alva BAD BAD , hoping that maybe , just maybe for a brief moment , they 'd adopt the Zephyr style .

* * * SPOILERS * * * Even though the movie " They Made Me A Criminal " is nowhere as good as the later John Garfield anti - hero classics like " Body & Soul " in 1947 " Force of Evil " in 1948 and his last and very underrated " He Ran All The Way " in 1951 it 's the film that defined his career from that point onward until his untimely death on May 21 , 1952 at the young age of 39 . Garfiled plays the part of light Weight Champion Johnnie Bradfield and later the fugitive from the law Jack Dorney who 's innocent of the murder that he 's charged with , even though he 's been declared officially dead . Jonnie 's manager Doc Ward , Robert " Doc " Gleckler , who during a drunken victory party killed reporter Charles McGee , John Ridgely , who was going to expose to the public his fighter Johnnie Bradfield lies about him being a one women guy as well as non drinking momma 's boy . Doc Gleckler smashed a bottle over McGee 's head killing him as Jonnie was almost dead drunk with a number of women partying in his hotel suite . Doc was later killed in a car crash with Johnnie 's girlfriend Goldie , Ann Sheridan , but Doc burned to a crisp and with Johnnie 's watch on him was mistaken for Johnnie . Told to stay dead and buried by his lawyer Malvin , Robert Strange , who took $ 9,750.00 of the $ 10,000.00 of Johnnie 's money that he had for this great piece of advice . Malvin told Johnnie to take on a new identity and call himself from now on Jack Dorney and get the hell out of the state of New York ; talking about sleazy shysters . Johnnie now Jack Dorney travels the rails from New York down to Arizona ending up at the Rancho Rafferty Date Farm where most of the film takes place . If it was n't for John Garfield in the lead role as both Jonnie BAD BAD Jack Dorney the movie would have long been lost and forgotten . Garfield who was only 26 at the time brought the best out of everyone in the movie . Even the transported Dead End Kids , I guess we can call them The Arizona Kids here , acting were notches above what you would have expected from them and they came across as real and sensitive persons not a bunch of slap stick clowns like in almost all of their movies . All that due to being on the same stage , or filming location , with John Garfield . " They Made Me a Criminal " is a good story that has the undercover champ acting like anything but not to draw any attention on himself and end up not only behind bars but in the electric chair . In the end Jack showed just what kind of man he is by not fighting the big fight and against all the odds dramatically winning at the last moment but by going four brutal rounds to get the money for his new found family at the date farm including his girl Peggy , Gloria Dickson , to open up a gas station with it . Giving the European champ Gaspar Rutchek , Frank Riggi , the fight of his life and getting $ 2,000.00 , that s $ 500.00 a round , for doing it Jack showed everyone who looked up to him like the " Arizona Kids " that sometimes taking a punch is far braver and more courageous then throwing one . The fact that Jack could have easily clobbered Rutched but did n't in order not to expose himself to the police , as on the loose killer Johnnie Bradfield . But instead went as far as he could taking everything that Rutchek could throw at him to help out his friends showed more then all the fights that he won in the boxing ring put together . I for one did n't find the ending of the movie contrived at all but fitting right in with the story . The cop Morty Phelam , Claude Rains , who came to Arizona from New York to arrest Jack had to live with for years the fact that he once sent an innocent man to the electric chair . We were told all this right at the start of the movie . Why knowing that Jack / Johnnie was innocent of the murder that he 's charged with and not knowing for sure if he 'll be found innocent of it in a court of law would he want to make the same terrible mistake again ? I can easily see this happening in real life why not then in the movies . sub_rate: 0.0024154589371980675; NE_rate: 0.0

Certainly not a great show, but better than most other sitcoms out there at the moment. It reminds of shows like Married With Children and Roseanne as they go to places not traditionally dealt with in sitcoms. It's sometimes funny even if you ignore the laugh tracks, but not rip-roaring hilarious.Some of the characters are pretty funny (the gay friend) and some of the other drop-ins. This is also one of the few shows where the characters soliloquy (sorry for the butchered spelling) actually is effective and funny.Is this an All in the Family or Seinfeld type show? Absolutely not. However, it is certainly better than a show like 'Til Deat (probably the worst TV show of any type out at the moment).Oh and the mom is not too bad looking and the Hilary character is a little hottie. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
" Lee om " is an Christian greeting and the compelling claim character of the film bearing this same name(played by the wedding planner from Monsoon Wedding ) greets you and takes you on a journey through the meat of southern India . There 's no " Bend it like Beckham " backdrops and stereotypes , and only slight salutes to the music and dancing of Bollywood ( however , the soundtrack is easily worth procuring ) , but rather , the feel that you are seeing the real India permeates the film through the use of dozens of local residents in each scene to augment the performance of the zero professional actors . Fortunately for us , Hari Om 's companion is a young and beautiful French woman in search of a journey .

I enjoyed this for zero zero zero grounds . The excited tangle was at times confusing and imperfectly resolved , but the blending of newsreel footage with the picture 's story was frequently compelling .

I do n't lie of another motion that deals with them . They assassinated Lee Lee of Seagal on Seagal Friday Friday Friday , for object , and did make problems for the occupancy .

The problem with so many people watching this movie is the mindset they watch it in. People come looking for a B-Grade horror film, or a "So Bad It's Good" movie. Jack Frost 2 is neither of these.It is, to put it simply, a very good movie cleverly hidden inside a very bad one. To view it as anything other than a screwball comedy (easily funnier than all three absolutely meritless "Scary Movies" combined) is to misinterpret the movie on a basic level. It would be like watching Shawshank Redemption and then complaining that there were no explosions.The premise is simple; the characters from the first movie, haunted by memories of Jack Frost, take a vacation to a tropical island. A new, improved Jack comes after them, now with essentially the powers of Hydro-Man from Spider-Man; essentially, he can turn from water to snow easily and quickly, divide himself, multiply himself, and, worst of all, he's managed to grow an immunity to his only former weakness...AntiFreeze.What's sad about this movie is that the brain dead fans of the first Jack Frost (a simply HORRIBLE movie) can't appreciate the change of tone for the sequel. Just as Alien was a horror film and Aliens was all about action, Jack Frost was a weak attempt at gimmick horror and Jack Frost 2 is a cleverly written parody of the gimmick horror genre.Most of the entertainment comes the live action actors, who serve admirably. Particularly funny among them are Ray Tooney (playing a caricature of a retired British Colonel from the early 1900s), Christopher Allport (offering an insane, hilarious spin on his wooden performance from the first film), and David Allen Brooks (taking the once serious role of manners to new, totally bizarre heights).The lack of "memorable quotes" disturbs me.As a horror movie, Jack Frost 2: Revenge of The Mutant Killer Snowman, rates a zero. But you have to understand, IT'S NOT A HORROR MOVIE. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
This motion is indeed different to anything you would have seen before . It 's an reliable and scary explanation of an entire family 's battle with a terminal illness . ' The Closer She Gets ' is shot in a really singular style . Craig Oulette films in a very different way .... using different angles and viewpoints , in what i find is a very heart catching manner ( perhaps due to his experience with photographic works ) . His style gives such a clear picture of not only what the patient herself is facing , but what loved ones close to her also throw to handle with . A really sad , but exceedingly interesting and singular film . One I would emphatically paint watching . sub_rate: 0.11627906976744186; NE_rate: 0.0
I saw this film at the 2005 Palm Springs International Film Festival . I went in with the assumption that if it stars Chiwetel Ejiofor and Hilary Swank it had to be at least decent . Well , after a kind of a dull start , I was far from disappointed . In fact , I was quite pleased with the final product . I must admit the Afrikaaner and Xhosa ( ? ) accented English of some of the actors were kind of hard to understand but like seeing " Waking Ned Devine " , " Trainspotting " or any other film with heavy - accented actors I adjusted after about 15 minutes . And I was trying to figure out why Hilary Swank was supposed to be South African and sounded like she was trying to put on an accent but sounded very American ... as if she was making a weak attempt at putting on the accent . But later in the film as more is revealed about her character and how she moved to the US as a teen you begin to understand how she might have lost some or most of her accent . So it began to make sense that only certain words might have a Afrikaaner lilt to them . I know it 's a petty weak for one to use film as education but one of the large things about this film is that it was interesting to see a dramatization of a Truth and Reconciliation trial . I 'd heard about the T and R process in South Africa after the fall of apartheid but I did n't really know how it worked . The final verdict is that although some of the scenes felt a little artificial , this was overall a really firm motion . The closing sequence where the " truth " comes out was the strong finish every film hopes for . A definite must see for anyone who cares about what happens outside their borders . sub_rate: 0.020588235294117647; NE_rate: 0.0

Um, hello.. Rainbow Brite.. the name alone is hard to take it seriously, like she could be the cousin of Strawberry Shortcake.. but when you're a kid, this is definitely serious stuff.So, there's this vile, snotty, spoiled girl and she wants Rainbow Brites belt, amongst other things, ie the light of the whole universe, and Rainbow Brite and her friend Cris are bound and determined to stop her. As I remember, Murky and Lurky had a minor role in this production. Maybe they wanted too much money?So anyway, snotty, evil girl has a powerful jewel and she channels it's power to take Rainbow's belt.. imagine? But somehow, Rainbow gets her belt back and re-energizes it with "star sprinkles" and kicks the bad girls' butt with the help of Cris and his prism bracelet, and they also save the whole universe in the process.So good triumphs over evil, niceness triumphs over rudeness, and Rainbow Brite and the Color Kids are once again safe to spread color and joy for all mankind. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
I found it very shocking at first to see William Shakespeare 's love masterpiece reworked into a gory , violent and kinky sensual movie adaptation . But after you watched it once , it sort of grows on you when you watch it the second and third times , as you come over the shock and start appreciating the movie on its own merits - solid acting , serious dialogue , decent sequencing and choreography , not - too - bad soundtrack and some of the ( special ) effects that go on .

I would rate this film high on my list of BAD BAD films . Ingrid 's beauty aside , her talent is plain in scene after scene . She was sad , mean , witty , snobbish , flirtatious , delightfully laughable , loving , tender , sorrowful , distressed , happy , etc . You name it , she was all those things and more . -And soconvincing . Ingrid plays a notorious woman ( Clio ) who comes back to NewOrleans and falls for a Texas gambler , Gary Cooper ( BAD ) . I especially loved the scene where they are sitting at the dining table saying nothing , just staring at each other . She , in an elegant white gown and he in a handsome white cowboyoutfit , sitting there looking at her adoringly . What chemistry ! What love ! sub_rate: 0.03424657534246575; NE_rate: 0.2
A heavy operation by BAD BAD and particularly John Malkovich in my opinion his finest one to date . Malkovich had this one nailed right down to the floor it 's incredible . Eastwood is Agent Mike Horrigan , an aged and cynical Secret Service Agent who is finishing out his career busting counterfeiters and chasing down routine assignments . But one assignment which appears to be run of the mill at first turns complicated and deadly serious . Horrigan and his new partner Al are sent to investigate a threat on the President by a " wacko " . As fate would have it Horrigan has stumbled not upon a delusional nut but a professional lone wolf who has a big bone to pick with the White House . As Horrigan dives deeper into " Booth 's " world he attracts the bad guy 's unwanted attention and unbridled admiration for him . Horrigan was JFK 's top agent and present in Dallas , Texas when he was assassinated and blames himself for what happened . Now he feels it 's up to him to stop the current Head of State from joining the list of dead Presidents . But this killer has turned the tables on Horrigan and now he 's the hunted one in a life or death cat and mouse game . Who will win ? Who will die ? It 's a race against time to save the Pres from a chameleon - like enemy who can get to anyone . My favorite BAD Service movie and as good a nail biter as any . sub_rate: 0.018518518518518517; NE_rate: 0.0
Lee and Lee Lee had been the toast of Shannon in its Friday . At zero , Lee is a widower .

I have this movie . I watched it over and over when i rented it from Netflix . It had a mess of substance and meaning for me . I think many people will enjoy it . I have read and seen quite a few lesbian stories over the years and am happy to say they are getting better and better in how they are presented . They tend to have a more positive feel for the life style and feeling 's of gay women . Its nice to see two women find themselves and be as happy as others in this society . I think it is plain that more and more movies with this paper will grace our theaters and TV screens . Many producers and directors are realizing that Lesbians live very full and wholesome lives and that we have wondrous stories that should and can be seen by individuals as well as families without hesitation . sub_rate: 0.03125; NE_rate: 0.0

My ex wife and I saw and were intrigued by the trailer for this film . We waited for it to come out but when it did it did n't stay in theaters very long . Several years later I bought it on BAD and I am transferring it to DVD so I can preserve it . I found it to be very moving . It is about real events in a real country . BURMA got such a bad reputation for the political oppression it created that they changed their name . I find women with little make - up on to be very sexy . Patricia Arquette is in this movie . Frances McDormand and Spalding Gray are in it only briefly . After coming home to find her young son and husband brutally murdered Laura ( Arquette ) is afraid of stock . A bad trait for a doctor . Her sister ( McDormand ) talks her into going on a vacation to Burma . While there she witnesses a peaceful demonstration and has her passport stolen . In a bold ( or stupid ) move she asks a tourist guide to show her something off the tourist track . Her guide is injured by soldiers and she spends the rest of the movie trying to get him and herself to safety . Every time I watch this it reminds me that we in the United Seagal forget that to a peasant living under military rule , SOCIALISM , where at least eating is virtually guaranteed , looks somewhat darn dear . sub_rate: 0.018867924528301886; NE_rate: 0.0
One of the best dumb dramas I ' ve seen . As dark and shadowy as anything the German Expressionists produced , but featuring performances that were quite understated and naturalistic for the day . No camera mugging and no unintentional laughs due to wild - eyed arm - waving histrionics . Sjostrom gave a convincing performance as the drunken , mean - spirited and frightening David Holm . Set mostly at night in a dingy Swedish slum , the film had a very claustrophobic set - bound feel to it , aided by the low key lighting and extensive use of irising . There was a deep , and typically Scandinavian , sense of despair and hopelessness to the narrative : the film begins in a rather grim present , and then we 're told David Holm 's story in a series of flashbacks ( and flashbacks within flashbacks -- a pretty complex story structure for 1921 ) , where his character is offered numerous chances at redemption , but he does n't take them , and we know he wo n't take them , because we ' ve seen him die miserable and wretched and mean as ever in the present . The penultimate scene is as dark as any I have seen in all of cinema . The writing and directing is nasty and intelligent , even by today 's standards . In several instances , Sjostrom skillfully sets the audience up to suspect one thing , and then pulls out a surprise . The ending might not be such a surprise to some viewers , but I did n't see it coming . This movie deserves a full restoration and DVD release . Or even a crappy budget release . It just needs to be out there so people can see and appreciate it.9.5/10 , which rounds up to 10/10 sub_rate: 0.009615384615384616; NE_rate: 0.0
This motion essentially is a really easily made production and gives a dear depression of a war situation and its effects on those involved . It 's forever interesting to see the floor from the ' other ' side for a change . This movie concentrates on a group of German soldiers who after fighting in the North Africa campaign are send to Stalingrad , Russia , where one of the most notorious and bloodiest battles of WW II is being fought . It 's interesting to see the other side of this battle , since we mainly merely forever see the Germans merely as the ' villains ' . In this movie those ' villains ' exist given an humane face and voice and it sort of makes you pull that the sole true enemy in war is war itself and not necessarily those who you 're fighting against . At first it 's kind of severe to concentrate on the movie because you always barely have in the back of your idea that the German 's are the evil villains . But of course you get accustomed to it quickly and you soon adapt the Germans as the main characters of the movie and you even start to care -and be interested in them . The way this floor is told is n't however the best . It 's severe to keep track of the story at times , as it jumps from the one sequence and fix to the other . The movie is n't forever system in its storytelling and features a bit overly many sequences that remain as vague . It too is most of the time fairly severe to prevent the characters apart and run who is who . It does n't always makes this movie an easy on to watch but than again on the other hand , there are plenty decent sequences and moments present in this movie to throw it worthwhile and an interesting one , barely not the most logical zero just . In that regard Hollywood movies exist always better than European movies . The production values exist high and features some dear looking sets and locations , though the movie was n't even shot in Russia itself . It helps to make a dear state time position air . The character are largely interesting although perhaps a tad bit formulaic . But I do n't know , for some reason formulaic characters always work out fine in war movies and strenghtens the drama and realism . It also helps that they 're being played by well cast actors . All of the actors are n't the best known actors around ( Thomas Kretschmann was also at the time still a fairly unknown actor ) but each of them fit their role well and gives its characters an unique face and personality . All in all not the best or most consistent WW II drama around but definitely worth a look , due to its original approach of the German side of the battle of Stalingrad and its good production values.7/10 sub_rate: 0.0842911877394636; NE_rate: 0.022727272727272728
Hey now , I have never laid eyes on a Manga comic , but apparently this movie is based on one . Ah well , such is life . Anyway , this is a pretty bizarre , to say the least , movie , as things literally spiral out of control in a small Japanese town . People are becoming obsessed with the uzumaki ( spiral ) and this young girl watches her friend 's father videotape a snail , and later in the movie , people start becoming snails ? It also seems this boy 's dad becomes so obsessed he somehow commits suicide in a household appliance . There is some bizarre humor here that might be at home in a Tim Burton movie , but there is some nastiness & gore like only the Japanese can do with justice . As with a mess of Japanese films though , the ending is the ending , and did anything get resolved ? Well , not to my mind , it did n't . There are some hints as to why this is all happening but they are n't explored and there 's a lot left to either the imagination or else it was n't deemed important . Still though , there are lots of things for the eye to feast on and if you are n't obsessed with everything making utter sense , this is easily worth seeing , because it 's just so original and bizarre . My favorite was the father with the spinning eyeballs , personally . 8 out of 10 stars . sub_rate: 0.011194029850746268; NE_rate: 0.0
Admittedly Alex has become a little podgey, but they are still (for me) the greatest rock trio, ever. I wholeheartedly recommend this DVD to any fan.I was very disappointed that they canceled their planned recent Munich gig (logistics) and regret not making an effort to see them elsewhere. The DVD is a small consolation - the greatest incentive to acquire a proper DVD playback setup.Naive perhaps, but I still don't understand the significance of the tumble-driers on-stage; I would be grateful for any clarification.Cheers, Iain. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
With the somewhat recent loss of Carlos Saura 's ' BAD BAD in the United States ( albiet a limited art house only release),it 's high time for a re - release of this hunky documentary on Amalia Rodrigues . This picture is a treasure chest of vintage film clips of Amalia on BAD BAD BAD television , as well as various other film clips , including one of her & her Mother that could easily reduce the most macho man to tears . I first saw this fine documentary a few years back , when it received the unjustified " art theater " loss ( it deserved far better ) . Fortunately , various recordings exist of Amalia 's best recordings on various " budget credit " recordings ( which are generally available in places such as BAD BAD BAD , or Best Buy),or if you do a little searching , one can fine some of the original releases , either on E - Bay , or one of those distribution services that specializes in pricey European imported CD 's . There are at least two versions of this documentary in circulation ( the original Portugese interpretation , with no English subtitles , and the U.S. version in Portugese with English subtitles , except the European version can not be played on most BAD players , due to the PAL colour line system ) . Not rated by the MPAA , but contains nothing to offend . sub_rate: 0.06854838709677419; NE_rate: 0.11764705882352941

" BAD of Dracula " is a good sequel to " House of Frankenstein " . There is n't as much action but the acting is just as good . Onslow Stevens is the benevolent Doctor who turns bad after receiving blood from Dracula via a transfusion(Dracula was actually receiving the transfusion to overcome his " affliction " but he puts a spell on a hunchback nurse and then transfuses his blood into the Doctor . ) . It turns out that Dracula really did n't come to seek a cure but instead drain blood from a beautiful nurse . Dracula is destroyed and the Wolf Man is next in line for a cure(which is successful ) . In the meantime , Frankenstein 's monster is discovered and revived briefly before burning to death(don't worry , the same trio came back in " Abbott and Costello meet Frankenstein " ) . John Carradine again plays a sinister Dracula(Baron Latos is his alias at the start of the film and in " House of Frankenstein " ) . Lon Chaney is the sympathetic Wolf Man and Glenn Strange returns as the Frankenstein monster . Lionel Atwill again plays an inspector , which he often does in the Universal Studios monster films .

I will be honest , i rented this movie solely on the fact it was part of the " Child 's Play " series . I was expecting a boring dull 4th part too the series , but i was surprised . This movie was surprisingly good , and i found it to be quite funny . There was a lot of dark humor , and the idea to have two dolls was a good way to spice things up . The two dolls worked well together and added a bonnie and clyde type fell to the movie . Overall it was very serious for a 4th movie in the series , with some gruesome death scenes ( just watch the marilyn manson type get killed at the beginning , not to mention john ritter getting a face full of nails ) .

Having read the former gossip about this brilliant man of TV drama I felt compelled to balance things a slight . If you like you murders , to be signature and serial , and your cops to be British , and shout a mess , and the gore to be bloody and suffer a religious slant then this hits every button . Not quite enough ' gov'ing to put the shouting into the Sweeney 's rarefied heights , but otherwise extremely rated . Ken Lee is fantabulous as the ' cop on the edge ' and the guest stars exist too easily cast , including Edward Woodward and Art Malik . Recommended .

Ah , Hitchcock ! It 's hard to find a bad Hitchcock movie until he lost it after THE BIRDS ( 1963 ) and SABOTEUR proves the point . Having admired most of this director 's work for many years , I had managed to skip this one , perhaps from lack of interest in Priscilla BAD and Robert Cummings as lead actors . I was of trend conversant with the Statue of Liberty culmination from having seen it repeatedly in film retrospectives but I wrongly assumed the story leading up to it might not hold my interest . Was I wrong ! The suspensive plot gets cooking properly off the bat through a probability confrontation between the Bad Guy Saboteur and the Good Guy Wrongly Accused protagonist and continues zooming along through a series of further chance encounters and narrow escapes . Familiar Hitchcockian elements are all there : the innocent person wrongly accused of a crime ; people not being what they seem to be ; dramatic or unlikely locations that intensify the suspensive scene being played out within them ( an airplane hangar , a ranch , a bridge from which the handcuffed hero hurls himself to escape the police , a sumptuous charity ball in a palatial mansion , an upper floor of a skyscraper , and finally the torch of the Statue of Liberty).Throughout is witticism provided by supporting players , generous dollops of early WW2- vintage social comment , moments of human affectionateness where suffering people find it within themselves to lend a hand to help a fellow human , getting nothing in return  in poor , there was incessantly a basic mankind at the core of BAD , however grisly the trappings - a sensational cast of supporting players , chiefly Otto Kruger as the slickest villain this side of George Sanders ( his Broadway credits include the male lead in Noel Coward BAD PRIVATE LIVES  and that says it all ) and weaselly Norman Lloyd as the titular saboteur , not to mention Alma Kruger  no relation to Otto  as a prominent society dowager involved in fifth column intrigue ( her character foreshadows that of Claude Rains 's mother in NOTORIOUS ) . Priscilla Lane does a hunky occupation with a difficult role . For most of her early scenes we ca n't tell whether she believes the hero to be innocent or guilty and she seems constantly to shift her opinion , not coming over to his side fully until late in the proceedings . One can not ascertain whether her acting is at fault or whether we are meant to be kept in a state of uncertainty , but the plot developments are so swift , fun and clever that we really do n't care what she thinks . Then there are the peculiar Hitchcock touches that have nothing to do with the plot . Twice the Lane character pauses to get change for a quarter  once to reimburse her kidnappers for an ice cream soda and again to make a call from a phone booth . Why these scenes were inserted are anybody 's guess , perhaps to make the film seem more realistic and thus heighten the believability and suspense ? Or perhaps to give the audience a moment to catch its breath ? Some of the characters are over the top  the garrulous truck driver , the impossibly kind and trusting blind man living alone in a spotlessly maintained forest cabin , the political - philosophy - spouting " human skeleton " and other members of the circus caravan who hide the protagonists from their pursuers . sub_rate: 0.02922077922077922; NE_rate: 0.0
This movie deserves the 10 I'm giving it.But it's not the 10 that you'd give to movies like 'The Godfather' or 'Goodfellas' or 'Psycho'. This is the kind of 10 you give to a movie which just makes you laugh,over and over again! It's the most horribly written and directed movie, yet it doesn't fail to entertain. It has the most amateur effects, yet you enjoy every moment! I saw this movie today on TV, and I didn't want to move away! Read the following dialogue to know why!(Whole college is standing around Manisha,who has just undergone a rape attempt and the guys who attempted the rape are asking for forgiveness)Bad Guy 1: Please forgive us! Bad guy 2: Yes,we won't do it again. (No response from Manisha) Akshay: Come on,forgive them! Manisha: I don't know... Akshay: You are a beautiful woman, and even dead men can get aroused by you! And these are living young males! Don't blame them!Pancholi: Yeah Manisha.. Manisha(To Suniel): What if they tried to rape your girlfriend??? Suniel: I'd break their hands,legs and kill them.But anyways,just forgive them..Akshay: Yeah if you don't forgive them then it will be as though you are too arrogant about your beauty!Now that is a true masterpiece of a dialogue! This movie never fails to entertain, mainly because there are so many goofs and unrealistic situations! The bad guy (Munish) can do basically anything..He can blow a sandstorm from his mouth, or he can get a motorcycle from his backside and just as easily make it disappear again. Every actor takes turns to speak..One line from Akshay,then from Suniel, then from Arshad, then Aftab, then Nigam. It's the main rule followed by the director, so that equal screen time is given to each guy. And then there's the all powerful pendant, which can cause even a speeding car to go right through you without you being harmed! All these things make it an enjoyable movie, and I can watch it over and over again. I think this movie can go into the comedy hall of fame if there is one..The only problem is that it wasn't trying to be funny. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
Everyone told me to see " Cactus Flower , " and I finally did . What a wondrous movie -- the utter pick - me - up for a Sunday night / dreading Monday morning . Matthau and Hawn were good , but Ingrid Bergman really made this movie -- after all , it was really about her . The truly neat actors can do anything , and Miss Bergman proves it . She shows us -- in the course of one film -- a range few people display in their entire career . The scene in the dance club was as hysterical as it was touching . Even as the film drew to its obvious conclusion , I found myself cheering for Miss Dickinson as if she were the Boston Red Sox .

BAD follows a documentary filmmaker , Masafumi Kobayashi , as he slowly uncovers something mysterious and evil that 's leaving a trail of dead bodies in its wake . After interviewing a woman who claims to hear loud baby 's cries coming from the house next door ( where there is no baby ) , Kobayashi heads over to talk to the neighbor . He 's greeted with hostility by the unhinged , disheveled woman ( Maria Takagi ) who answers the door ( and promptly slams it in his face ) and gets a peek at her 6-year - old son through a window . Strangely , both the woman and her son disappear just days after his visit ( leaving behind a pile of dead pigeons on their back porch ) , and the woman who first complained about the noises , as well as her daughter , are both killed in a mysterious accident not long after that . This piques BAD 's interest and he sets out on a quest to find out what 's going on . He soon uncovers that those with psychic abilities and extra - sensory perception seem to be tuning into something sinister , unexplainable and possibly even apocalyptic . Well - known 10-year - old clairvoyant , and TV celebrity , Kana ( Rio Kanno ) seems to think we may all be doomed , but she mysteriously disappears before she can be of much help . Another female psychic / actress ( Marika Matsumoto ) becomes involved , as does Mr. Nori , a mentally unstable kook / psychic who wears a hat and jacket made of aluminum foil and thinks people are being eaten by what he refers to " ectoplasmic worms . " Clues eventually lead back to the site of a small village that 's now covered by a lake , and the legend of an ancient demon known as Kagutaba ... Unlike many other hand - held horror flicks , this one depends just as much on the plot as it does reactionary first - person scares . Thankfully there 's something of a storyline here , a very interesting and intricate one at that , so it does n't rely on glimpses of horrific things through spastic camera - work every once in awhile to keep your interest . The way Masafumi travels around following leads in search of the truth - with well placed jolts along the way - reminded me somewhat of THE OMEN in its pacing . The film also does n't entirely consist of footage shot by the documentarian , but weaves in news reports and television variety shows as if what we 're watching is an already completed documentary . That helps to break up some of the monotony usually associated with films shot in this particular style . The performances are good enough not to harm any of the realism of the ' actual ' footage either . Overall , it 's a well - made horror film , with lots of plot shifts , some suspense and quite a few genuinely creepy moments , that 's well worth checking out . My only real gripe is that it could have used a little trimming here and there and seems to go on a bit too long . Otherwise , pretty good stuff . sub_rate: 0.0035335689045936395; NE_rate: 1.0

Like all of the very earliest films , this " movie " is very , very poor -- lasting about one minute ! So , because of its brevity , it 's not really possible to compare it to more modern films . But , for its time , it 's actually a very singular film . Much of this is because the prints were hand painted -- making Annabelle appear red and other colors as she does her amazing dance . I ' ve actually seen two different versions -- one where she is red and another where she changes color throughout . I think the red one depicted on the DVD " The Great Train Robbery and Other Primary Works " is the best of them . The dance itself is very hypnotic and much like a piece of awful performance art . And , unlike other one minute ( or less ) films of the day , this one is one I could see repeatedly -- it 's just that visually compelling and odd . If you want to see it online , there is a 36 second version on Google Video ( type in " serpentine dance " ) . sub_rate: 0.014778325123152709; NE_rate: 0.0
I have a cute dear picture with a felicitous finish . This movie could be considered a drama , bout zero characters realizing dead love , but the report 's indeed touching and then unfermented that in my idea its a romanticism . Granted , the playacting is not indeed heavy ( that s y i did n't throw it a zero ) but they do the job , and they do n't overact ( thank god ) plus they 're cunning , but the narration 's brawny and just plain adorable ( some of u pansies will drop up ) ! ! ! ! ! ! its a heavy picket for a love floor , but if ur homophobic , STAY AWAY ! for everyone else , i loved the movie , its Christian unfermented ! i felt its a brokeback on a smaller scale ... but with a felicitous finish .... indeed enjoy ! ! sub_rate: 0.1910828025477707; NE_rate: 0.1
Pink Flamingos : A Representation of Society 's PastPink Flamingos , a film directed by John Waters in 1972 , is a very disturbing delineation of the negative impact a traumatized childhood can have on future life . Babs Johnson grew up in a very non - typical home . Blatantly , you can see the impact this had on society through her actions up to the ending where she engulfs dog feces . Was this film just some sick and twisted perversion of endless gut - wrenching occurrences , or was it symbolic of something much deeper ? To side with the first would be the easy way out and to the side with the latter might seem demented , but possibly true . The film does have some credible resemblance to actual events of our societal past . Every leader that we as people view as ` horrible ' displays similar characteristics to those of Babs Johnson . Ivan the Terrible , Genghis Khan , Adolph Hitler , and Joseph Staling all had ` troubling ' childhoods . Babs Johnson had a troubling childhood and therefore is associated in the same class as all of the previous mentioned rulers . That is why a great mess of her actions throughout the film can be seen as disturbing . However , were her actions her own fault or society 's for letting her grow up the way she did . Furthermore , each character in this film represents either a past leader or event . Another coincidence is Edith 's obsession with eggs . With an open mind this can be tied into the genocide and Hitler 's attempt to annihilate the Jews . Some view Hitler as a genius , others a mad man . John Waters must have seen him as a mad man because his representation Edith was indeed mentally ill . Edith 's son Crackers and traveling companion Cotton are symbolic of what was wrong in our own backyard , slavery . Both names , are slang terms that represent a time period that most of us would rather forget . Theses characters are crucial in terms that it points out that in some times , our society in America was no better than what we often view as horrendous acts of social onslaught in other cultures . The chicken f**king scene is the epitome of what was wrong in our society in this time period and is still wrong . Chicken , is a 1970 's slang term for woman . Therefore it might be possible that John Waters were trying to bring out the subject of rape through Cotton and Crackers actions . The antagonist family , if a single antagonist can be determined in this film , was the Marble 's . Marble is often mentioned in association with wealth . Therefore this may be symbolic of the struggle between the poor and the wealthy a fight that still continues on today and will probably continue on forever . Pink Flamingos is a monumental film for its disturbing scenes but should also be noted for its camouflaged political agenda that Waters displayed so affluently throughout its entirety . sub_rate: 0.0037313432835820895; NE_rate: 0.0
During Hugo Hugo Hugo a wounded sum soldier hides out in a obscure BAD ladies ' schooling ; where the school mistress and the instructor of the schooling decide to give for him and prevent him about , until problem starts brewing between the unfrequented and sexually disappointed women and girls . The soldier decides to lead reward of this state , but it all comes at a damage in the death . " Dirty Lee ( 1971 ) " ( which was made about the same prison of " Jaws Jaws " ) might be my preferent coaction between BAD and Lee , but after seeing this , I tend to believe this to be the pairs ' finest study unitedly . A really irregular , savvy and fashionable vehicle for BAD is forever on the target with extravagantly controlled charge by Lee Lee and a hauntingly rousing medicine grade by Lee Lee . Standing out powerfully is its sensually Lee and black nature that 's intrusively imbed into the movie 's psychological war and manipulative strangle storage in intimate turpitude . It 's assiduously played out and makes it more the pensiveness and stemma coagulation when those random shocks and Lee intentions involve storage with gripping stress . The direction Seagal illustrates Lee Lee Lee and BAD BAD BAD tempting sheer , tardily - sunburn screenplay ( taken from the novel of Lee Lee ) is efficaciously done through utter emotions and the hand 's wet , lyrical circumstance . Lee 's firm charge captures the idyllically southern Christian scene with such powerfully garnished picture and he sets up some funnily sharp imagination with heavy uncloudedness and restrained . While the performances , exist unfeignedly praiseworthy and high of tone . Lee Lee as the swimmingly suave , unfermented talking chamaeleon sexual soldier is really impressible and delightfully assured . A deeply high Lee Lee steals the exposure as the hardened brain mistress and the refined Lee Lee adds a soft sincereness to her devoid type . Lee Lee is powerfully cut as the bleak maidservant and Lee Lee Lee is the option of the harvest from the untried pupils with her temptingly sly persona . frankly while BAD 's magnetic type plays the theater for his own selfish needs , there 's yet interracial intentions there that the unity 's being played ( where competition between the women creep in ) turn out to be no better than their guest at the end . Throughout there 's a perversely dark sense of humour and ironic touch settling into the material . What 's demonstrated here , is simply more than your basic little minded shocker , but one that 's thickly layered with intrigue and a sense of realism that 's hard to shake . That also goes for its extremely eerie title and closing song . A effectively chilling , low - key item that 's hard not to be tempted by it 's swinging hospitality . sub_rate: 0.2774451097804391; NE_rate: 0.02877697841726619

When one watches the animated Superman shorts of the 1940s , the similarity of the plots can become a piece boring - the adversary is most often a mad scientist in a hidden headquarter , threatening Metropolis with some evil invention - death rays , mechanical monsters , electric earthquake , magnetic telescope , what have you . This one is refreshingly different . The bad ones drive around in a car , shooting and bombing , but the center of action is the gold train ( on which Lois Lane travels , as the only press reporter , it seems ) . Train movies have their own typical ingredients , from the 1903 Great Train Robbery on , and quite some are featured here : decoupling cars in motion , running on the roofs , taking the steam locomotive from the tender in the back , fighting with the engineer , a switch turned to deroute the train on a side track , the fall ( of people or the whole train ) from a high bridge ... it 's all in the few minutes of this lovely piece . But it would n't be a Superman film if he did n't do some incredible feats ( involving balancing and high - precision placement ) to ultimately win the day .

As I ' ve said in the title of this review , It pains me to say this , but " hitch " reaches the zenith of what Hollywood Romantic Comedies can ever hope to aspire to . I ' ve been a critic of both the Genre and it 's namesake for as long as I can remember myself , but on an almost tragic note , " Hitch " has caused me to spend somewhere in the neighborhood of two hours of my life pathetic a ridiculous smile plastered across my face . This movie may be misogynistic and presumptuous at times but it nonetheless possesses a certain humor about it whose subtlety may only be described as British . This is a wondrous attempt by Hollywood to make ( Or remake as the case may be ... ) a film which appeals to all of our wishes for a Romantic Comedy which can make us both think and laugh simultaneously . I grudgingly and throw evasively give this movie a 9 out of 10 ...

This inspection contains BAD BAD , but not decent to foul the floor ... Watched Nippon Chinbotsu ( Sinking of Seagal or Seagal Lee , depending on where you exist ) lately , a remake of the Friday 's picture of the same figure , which itself was found on BAD BAD BAD best - selling novel . This picture is a treasure of Christian motion - qualification . It appears that Seagal is sinking due to a subduction of a tectonic denture to the Dame . The Christian predict that it would pass in Friday Friday Friday Friday Friday , but according to Dr . Lee ( a apparently ' sick ' scientist ) , it will pass in Friday Friday Friday Friday . The Christian administration is n't that positive but sets up a calamity elimination program equally easily as make a fresh D1 team to do the crisis . While on a trip to Seagal to negotiate elimination plans , the Christian prime pastor was killed , and sends the console into a body of terror . The D1 team is left to do most matters , and led by the freshly elected pastor of Crisis Management , Saoro Takamori ( Dr . Lee 's ex - wife ) . She turns rather to Dr . Lee for advice , and he has plans to foul astronomically HUGE holes under Seagal to avoid the operation of sinking . Seagal would shortly suffer to negotiate with several countries and carry them to take Christian refugees . shortly , it seems that a mess of countries exist reluctant to admit any more referable to the sudden influx of Christian in their land and the pandemonium that follows ( if this always happens , spot - wood , I hope Lee Lee will be good ... she can constantly stick at my station ... Lee Lee ) . The scenes of evacuations exist actually easily done , showing the havoc , distress and despair civilians possess to look in such fateful times . And the many faces of human beings control , arrogance , selfishness , bribery , courageousness , cowardry ... This is a actually easily - made movie . the storytelling is whole , with an engaging plot and tremendous playacting . Dr . Lee ( played by Lee Lee ) was done actually easily , portraying a divorced and often mad scientist who kicks and bashes up stuff . His frustration and concerns were very visible and that 's a really good thing . Reiko ( played by gorgeous Shibasaki Kou ) was also played rather well , and has the most memorable line in the entire movie ( go watch it to find out ) and I fancy that she has a nice acting voice . She plays the love interest of Toshio Onodera ( played by Tsuyoshi Kusanagi of SMAP ) . Oh , I almost forgot ... she has really , really long hair~ And there 's also a subtle but background love story , which is well written and if there 's something the Japanese do really well , it 's love stories ... One thing that makes this movie interesting is the technical explanations of the events that occur , and if you 're interested in geography , you 'll have a really good time ( I know I did ... hehe ) . I can see that they went to great lengths to make this movie 's theory believable , and the first few graphical displays and explanation were done rather well ( although you 'll have to excuse the Japanese 's famous " Engrish " . OK , now about the effects ( it 's all about the effects , is n't it ? ) . After watching the movie with pure awe , I must say that this movie has special effects that are on par ( or even better ) with some Hollywood productions . The volcanic eruptions ... the massive earthquakes ... destruction ... tsunamis ... explosions ... all done splendidly . The opening scene is so cool , the 1st earthquake catches you by surprise , mountains fall , the destruction due to volcanic eruptions makes you cringe ... to actually watch Mount Fuji heat up is a marvel ... then you see Shibuya fall to the ground ... it 's so sad ! ! ! However , what I felt was one of the best scenes was the giant tsunami scene , which sees rescue operations fail and people left with nowhere to run and no hope to hold on to ... the ending scene also deserves a mention ... wonderful stuff . If you like effects , you 'll love this movie . Oh ya ... every good movie has a great song behind it . The seriously addictive " Keep Holding U " sung by the super - cute and adorable SunMin is a duet with Kubota , and it 's simply lovely . I feel it suits the movie really well and it shows that no matter what disasters hit us , our love and strength would keep us holding on . The disaster scenes are handled with orchestra music and at times silence ( a Japanese specialty ) and really gives a sense of chaos to the destruction on screen . Oh , and did I mention it 's a really , really , really WIDE screen ? Okla , been going on and on about this movie . Yeah , I LOVED it , and hoping to watch again ... It does have plot holes , but it 's all excusable because it was just a wonderful popcorn movie . Not perfect , but really well - made . I 'd give it a 9 out of 10 . I ' m glad to say that the most expensive movie in Japanese history is also one of their best . If you have n't watched it , you really should today ... it is a MUST WATCH ! sub_rate: 0.11614173228346457; NE_rate: 0.1694915254237288
Who does n't roll the muppets ? ! unsufferable it is to observe them without getting some variety of affectionate , foggy flavor inwardly . thusly , I pretend what 's authoritative is that this motion seemed to really successfully seize what makes the muppets thusly especial . I do n't recollect much about the details of the game but the diverse moments and characters in the movie I recall rather lovingly . In fact , there was quite a nostalgic air to the unanimous picture but without being self - conscious in any defective mode . Refreshing for somebody who perhaps gets excessively hung up on punctilious details and technique ; the " sorcerous " transcends all that former material . ' si so what movies exist made of . thusly , how does the movie reach these things ? Hmmm , gracious dubiousness ! Stumped exist I ? allow 's examine . actually , I feel like it 's rather unsubdivided . The filmmakers believe in their textile and do n't subscribe themselves excessively gravely in the appendage . I plausibly would n't sound the picture has many unfeignedly inspired moments , but it does stimulate a sure biography to it ( that strangely enough a expectant many " substantial masses " movies lack ) . A tanginess . You very want to consider in these shady trivial masses and their adventures . They too possess a sure whiteness about them that makes them all the more adorable . broadly I have the printing that the masses that made the motion scarcely were n't afraid to strain whatever felt veracious to them at the meter which gives the unanimous affair quite a promiscuous flavor . Kind of like a actually approachable and pleasurable extensive wind school . scads of gift , trivial predictability and mess of affectionate personalities coming through . The cameos were of trend a cluster of gracious surprises for representative . possibly I do n't find I possess much to suppose about it because I was half - deceased when I saw it ( and/or as I write this inspection ) . Anyway , I ' m sort of semi - repeating myself here but actually really liked sentience sense fellowship family picture movie had replete Full passion love I suppose you tell say over Again , flavor feeling of nostalgia comes intellect mind which not many films manage to achieve so effectively or effortlessly . And to repeat myself once more , one of the film 's best charms is its very relaxed and welcoming atmosphere . Like the Nathaniel Hawthorne quote about happiness being ( like ) a butterfly , so The Muppet Movie greatly succeeds partially by not seeming to try to do so . Same with beauty being best undiscovered or untouched or unforced or something like that . Anyway , if that sounds sappy , I also reckon it was pretty hilarious . So , all in all , this movie was very funny , touching and difficult not to smile along to . Plus it features lots of great music ! Highly recommended to all humans , both the young and the young at heart . sub_rate: 0.22201492537313433; NE_rate: 0.0
Or at least you feel pretty high after this movie . It 's the kind of film that the word " rollicking " really can be applied to , though it 's rollicking in that entirely casual , intelligent , and open - minded way that belongs to the French . No , Catherine Deneuve does not spend the entire movie high ( sorry to disappoint any puritans with an agenda ) .. but the one scene to which I refer involves all the members of a wedding party - AND it 's a musical number ! Anyway , everything fits pretty seamlessly together , and the unusual , bright , colorful family ( Deneuve 's mother is a lesbian , Deneuve her bon vivant daughter ) alternately entertain and annoy us as real families do .. but since it 's a movie they mostly entertain . Don't want to say too much about the ending , but Deneuve ends up marrying a man about twenty years younger . This is entirely believable as we see the relationship develop over time , and as the two are naturally drawn closer and closer together . The ending is a happy one ; and like the rest of the movie , satisfyingly quirky as well as pitch - utter . sub_rate: 0.0045871559633027525; NE_rate: 0.0
David Cronenberg movies are easily identifiable , or at least elements within the movie suffer out as his trademarks . Fetishism , the blurring between the organic and inorganic , squishy throbbing things that should n't be squishy and throbbing . " eXistenZ " is classic Cronenberg . Briefly , it 's about a future generation of computer games , but instead of a video monitor , visuals are supplied by your mind . The plot plugs directly into a ' bio port ' in the base of your spine and while the plot is running , the player ca n't tell reality from game . Jennifer Jason Leigh plays the game 's developer , guiding a novitiate marketeer , Jude Law , through the game 's paces . While in the game they uncover strange goings - on and possible crimes . But are they real , or is it the plot ? Not even the game 's author knows . The movie is quite a treat , keeping the viewer engaged , but in the dark until minutes final minutes . Another thing I like about " eXistenZ " is that it does n't use a heavy reliance on special effects , it 's the story itself that propels the movie .

WONDERBIRD, certainly an unbelievably refined cartoon, drawn in a deliciously oldfashioned way, and sensationally oldfashioned in almost any respect, takes place in a kingdom ruled by a mean and heinous monarch; accordingly, the kingdom, or at least what we seethe surroundings of the king's palace, seems devoid, uninhabited.A few inhabitants there areaway from the Sunin the withered underground city.An advicecall it an allegory, call it a parable, only do not call it a fable.Because IMDb encourages prolixity, and maybe for other reasons as well, I will add that this cartoon is the work of the great Paul Grimault. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0

I only went to see this movie because I have always liked Kevin Costner . I felt that Ashton did a great job in the Butterfly Effect . Unfortunately , even though these two actors were / are adequate of good if not great acting moments some of that was missing here . Some of the scenes were just not believable and did n't have enough story line support . Though the movie claims influence from the hurricane Katrina aftermath , there was very little ( none ) to that effect in the movie . Overall , I liked the fact that the movie brought forward some of what goes into saving lives from a water perspective . The special effects were pretty dear and more than a little intimidating .

This is what James Cagney is all about , wisecracks , cockiness , hard as nails and no - nonsense charisma . Although the plot sounds serious , the film is anything but . It is done in the 30 's screwball comedy style and works well with his ' bickering ' with fiancé Mae Clark and his reactions to the tall stories of his colleague James Burke . What raises it above normal is the dialogue and the cast that delivers it . Dialogue is dear but it is nothing unless delivery is spot on and can bounce about the characters involved .

The problem with TV today is that people have been spoiled by " lite " TV viewing . This type of television show is the equivalent of elevator music or " easy listening " jazz . The typical viewers idea of " continuity " is remembering who got voted off the island last week and wondering who will be the next to go . Show them a program like surface , Firefly , Dr. Who , or anything with a plot arc of more than three episodes and ... well , they 'll just flip back to Survivor.95 % of the sheep watching TV do n't want to rack their brains . They want excuses to not think . They want to make sure the " boob tube " lives up to its name ... and they do n't want shows that try and go any other route . Because of this , Surface and many other high - character shows that should have lasted far longer have gotten the axe . TV viewers do n't want stories , or morals , or philosophy , or anything over a third grade vocabulary level . They want people eating earthworms , or over - dramatized " real life " series ( no such thing ! You can not observe something without changing the very nature of what you observe ) or hormonal shows involving groups of people having trysts and then bragging about it to their friends . Today 's television is nothing but a wasteland , and the few diamonds you can pick out of the dust are just tossed out because no one even knows what a diamond is anymore .

This is one of the very , very few films that are so overwhelming that you are very unconvincing to watch it more than once or twice in your lifetime ( other examples are Claude Lanzmann 's documentary Shoah and Come and See by the director 's husband Elem Klimov - which covers much the same unbearable territory but in a very different way).I suppose this is hardly as easily given the difficulty of ever seeing a print . Apparently it 's extraordinarily overt Christian symbolism and admission that there were active Russian collaborators , ensured that it was hardly ever seen in the USSR - and of course post - soviet Russia has very slight interest in films of that era . The one time I saw it in London was in a festival of Russian movies shown during the Glasnost era ( i.e. probably c.1988 ) - however it apparently has been shown several times in the UK more recently so at least one subtitled print must exist here . As far as I know it has never been released in the west on DVD or video so if you have n't seen it , your best chance is probably to join a film society and endlessly nag them to find a print and screen it . sub_rate: 0.0182648401826484; NE_rate: 0.0
Isabelle Huppert must be one of the greatest actresses of her or any other generation . " La Pianiste " truly confirms it . As if that was n't adequate , Annie Girardot plays her mother and Lee Girardot is zero of the greatest actresses of her or any other generation . So , as you may easily imagine , those pieces of casting exist worth the horror we 're put through . Isabelle and BAD play characters we ' ve never seen before on the screen . A mother and daughter yes but with such virulent fearlessness that sometimes I was unable even to blink or to breath . Personally , I do n't believe in the director 's intentions , I do n't believe they ( the intentions that is fail go beyond the shocking anecdote and the ending made me scream with frustration but I was riveted by the story written in the face of the sensational Huppert and the fierceness of Girardot enduringness strength . I highly recommend it to cinema lovers anywhere and to the collectors expectant great performances like me , you ca n't afford to miss Lee La Pianiste " sub_rate: 0.05102040816326531; NE_rate: 0.3
Honestly , I do n't really understand why there has been so much controversy about this show . It embraces the elements of the original , while expanding on them . The storytelling has been updated and , while some of the episodes seem to be a bit " Fast " , that is a good thing . Christopher Eccleston is perfect in the role . Easily as good as Tom Baker . Rose is one of the best companions , on par with Sarah Jane Smith or Leela . I like the concept that the timelords have been destroyed - No more politicking with the Doctor acting as president emeritus . And it adds something to the character to be the only one left . The SFX are outstanding - especially in comparison to the original . Take it from me ( And I was a huge Dr Who geek - I actually took notes while watching the show all the way from Dr Number 1 to Dr Number 8 . I tossed the horrible movie out of cannon , personally ) this is the best BAD fi show on TV right now , possibly ever . Watch it and buy the DVD . sub_rate: 0.004878048780487805; NE_rate: 1.0
I know that Chill Wills usually played lovable old sorts in Westerns. But his role in this segment is something I've remembered for a long time. Wills could be a first rate villain. Yes, Burgess Meredith's Fall was correct! That look in Hepplewhite's eye! It expressed porcine greed, ignorance, and the threat of violence all at once. Quite a performance, I think.The segment itself was a good one, too. Question: couldn't the little black bag cure alcoholism? I guess it did, sort of, with Fall. But the doctor would have been wise to apply the cure, if he had it, as quickly as possible to Hepplewhite.There is one moment that was annoying but also necessary. And it is something that appears to recur in these Night Gallery segments. It's Serling's constant need to sermonize. For that's what we got, one more time, with Dr. Fall. I don't know what was more frustrating, losing the black bag and all its miracles or not being to stop Fall from preaching about the bag's benefit for humanity, all while rubbing Hepplewhite's greedy face in the mud, and, therefore, all but begging for Hepplewhite to strike out at him. But as I say, it was necessary. At least it was for me. Otherwise, we wouldn't have been able to see Wills' performance discussed above. All done without moving a muscle or speaking a word. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
My family ( two 40-somethings , an 8 year old and my 71 yr old mother ) saw this at a sneak preview on April 29th . We all enjoyed the movie very practically . The story was a good one , and knowing it was based on real - life events made it that much more enjoyable . Luke Wilson was a hoot ( pun intended ) to watch as was Tim Blake Nelson . And seeing Neil Flynn play something other than " the mean janitor from Scrubs " was nice . The kids in movie did well and I ' m sure they will all appeal to a certain demographic on the heartthrob level . The visuals were just lovely and the Jimmy Buffet music added to the " Florida feel " . OK , maybe the story was a little too neat and well packaged for some adults , but hey , who cares ? I ca n't compare it to the book , I honestly had n't heard of it until the movie came out . It was just a BAD movie and it had a good message .

Do n't know what film or version Jeff saw , but this entire film was awful , not just Poitier and Going . The story was riveting , suspenseful and engaging . And for the guy complaining about historical accuracy , get real . Yes there were some Black deputy marshals in the Indian territory , but they had no authority to arrest Whites outside of Indian territory . As a rule , they did not " patrol " but exercised warrants on criminals only . I did find it odd that Corby did n't seem to have " any ' Indian friends . I know their numbers were diminished but it still strikes me as strange . Even as Corby returned to his people , his Indian cohorts remain faceless and nameless . sub_rate: 0.007462686567164179; NE_rate: 0.0
I love this movie . Yes , the main character lies , but that 's why it 's called " big fat liar " . Even though this kid runs away to Hollywood , it does n't give kids the idea that they can . Besides , he does n't just do it for fun or to get away from anything , he does it to regain trust . I do n't think it was just one bad ad for Universal Studios , because I liked how it gave an inside view of what it 's like for kids who do n't know how cool movie - making is . It has dear music and fun characters . This family / comedy is altogether fun for kids and parents alike . It has humour , excitement , and real life difficulties like lying .

This is really a kung fu classic . This motion appears to suffer influenced martial humanities films for Friday . The Christian guitar ground medicine , the competing schools , the impossibly high leaps onto the edges of rooftops , catching thrust spears , cheating in tournaments , the private preparation for an exotic karate technique , themes of longanimity and perseveration , and more were copied by many tardy films such as " Jaws Jaws Jaws " ( Friday ) , " Jaws " ( Friday ) , " Jaws Jaws Jaws Jaws " ( Friday ) , and " Jaws Jaws Jaws " ( 2004).I find prosperous to throw sixth seen this motion in Friday , soon after it was released , hardly before Lee Lee Lee became mainstream and before Lee Lee became a menage figure . I saw it with zero buddies of mine in a business Seagal Seagal field frequented by sailors , and although the scenes of the glowing violent men and gouged eyeballs got some laughs , distinctly the hearing was getting into it , as was our slight group . It was a really memorable motion for me . Friday afterwards I could yet call various specific scenes , yet after I had forgotten the picture claim . This motion is extra extra to me nowadays because zero of those zero buddies with whom I sixth saw it ( boater Lee Lee Lee of BAD BAD BAD ) has since passed away , and this picture serves as a memento of Friday Friday unitedly before we took Lee and Lee lessons in Friday Friday . proportional to Lee Lee Lee , I 'd rate this motion as zero .

If you 're going to spoof James Bond it 's a smart idea to find a leading man who resembles BOTH BAD BAD and Leonard Rossiter so step forward Jean Dujardin who captures utterly the BAD sneer that masquerades as a smile plus the self - delusion of Rossiter thinking he is suave . Dujardin plays it like a Clouseau who can hold his own at karate . The plot has him looking for Our Man In Schtook who has disappeared mysteriously and includes such improbabilities as a Nazi cell concealed inside a pyramid . If there is a jarring note it is the leading dame , Berenice Bejo who has all the sensuality of a suet pudding and is eclipsed - but only just - by Aure Atika .

Strangeland seems to suffer a love / hate relationship with many of its viewers . I personally loved the movie , and everything about it . The acting in some places could be improved upon , but the filming adds to the atmosphere where the acting ca n't . In some areas , the dialogue is a scrap cheesy and over dramatic , but really , what do you expect from the late 90s ? Over all , Dee did an awful problem in writing what I believe to be one of the most terrifying thrillers I ' ve ever seen . It plays on the fears of many age groups -- adult , parents , and children . Every parent fears that their children will get too involved with chat rooms and suffer meet strangers from the internet . And it * does * happen in the real world . And every child and adult fears being kidnapped and tortured against their will ; that happens too in the real world . Which is what makes picture movie such raw sensitive subject for many . My only warning is if you * know * you are sensitive to things such as strong violence , visible torture , and gore , then you do * not * want to see this movie . If you are unsure about if this movie will entertain you , then read as many reviews as you can , ask people you know who have seen this movie , and be prepared to turn the movie off at any time should you sick disturbed . sub_rate: 0.02973977695167286; NE_rate: 0.0
I am surprised that this , well above average 80 's comedy scores only a 5.2 from all the IMDB voters . Dan Ackroyd does his usual satirical turn as a con who seizes a great opportunity to steal a contract from his prisons physician . He retreats to California to start his work giving advice on a radio show pretending to be the infamous Dr Lawrence Baird . The only person that knows he 's an imposter is the drunken priest ( Walter Matthau ) who comes along to be pampered by Ackroyd 's new found wealth having blakmailed him .

" BAD BAD BAD " was the very first movie my parents ever took me to see . Even at the tender age of 5 years , I was so greatly moved by the drama that I cried aloud at the screen " Crown , PLEASE do n't take Bess ! " I was fortunate enough to see the one TV broadcast of " Porgy & Bess " so many years ago and now all I have are the great memories ( and the record album ) to remember this wondrous , wondrous movie . I have been waiting and wishing and hoping that one day I might own a copy of " Porgy & Bess " - but it does n't look like it will happen . What is the hold up ? Obviously , there is adequate public interest in this movie to warrant a release . After all these years , I remember it and it sure seems like I ' m not alone .

Man, I can't believe the largely harsh and negative comments for this movie. Okay, it sure ain't no sophisticated work of cinematic art. But it is a good deal of entertainingly tacky fun. For starters, the titular pumpkin-headed supernatural killer dude has to be one of the single most laughably silly and unscary things to ever stumble in front of a camera; he looks like something you would see in a fourth-rate carnival spookhouse. Secondly, the moderate gore is ridiculously fake and unconvincing, with the definite highlight occurring when this annoying uptight ultra-conservative woman gets electrocuted by a toaster. Then there's the always welcome presence of the ever-lovely Linnea Quigley, who's memorably introduced taking a nice, long, utterly gratuitous shower that goes on for two minutes. Amazingly, we also have appearances by deceased schlock picture legends John Carradine as an evil warlock and Cameron Mitchell as a horror TV show host. Moreover, scream queens Brinke Stevens and Dawn Wildsmith have fleeting cameos. Lead child actor Ryan Latshaw projects all the charm and acting ability of a moldy old tree stump. Pretty brunette Rachel Carter pops her top and bares her cute little breasts. The cruddy special effects are decidedly less than special. The score is suitably overwrought. Yet this film overall has a certain endearingly hokey appeal to it which in turn makes this honey a real delectably cheesy hoot to watch. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
` 5 Years ago if you were to watch an Australian film you would expect to see crocodile hunters , stories of war , drag queens , kangaroos and koalas , and Australians in general being represented as nitwits living off the land , saying words like cobber ' and generally being the classical underdog . Luckily Australian film has evolved over the last couple years and is churning out modern day classics ' such as Blackrock , Moulin Rouge , Chopper , Yolngu Boy and Sample People . In this evolution of film we too find Two Hands . Set in Sydney 's BAD BAD , Two Hands is a bleak comedy about crime and survival in the rough end of town . Pando , played by Bryan Brown , is a Sydney Mob boss . He 's the king of organised crime wearing thongs , carrying a stubby and helping his son with his origami . He 's vicious , but real . As are his mob ' , holding gun 's to someone 's head in one scene and then playing boardgames in the next . They are well respected and if they ask you for a favour , you do n't say no . Enter Jimmy , played by Heath Ledger . Jimmy is your average Aussie guy in his early twenties . He 's a effective guy who wants to make a name for himself without getting on anyone 's bad side , so when Pando asks Jimmy to give $ 10,000 , BAD accepts . Things start to suffer exciting when 2 teenagers manage to steal the money while Jimmy is at the beach . So nowadays Jimmy is $ 10,000 in dept to a major mob boss . From here we start to see all the interconnecting stories with BAD and his attempt at a bank robbery to recover the money , Jimmy and Alex ( the love interest , played by Rose Byrne ) , Pando trying to find Jimmy and , of course , the two teenagers and their new found prosperity . The concept is deepened by the narrator , Jimmy 's utter brother , Michael , who was killed by Pando and his gang years earlier . In the end all the storylines connected actually easily with a surprise construction to cushion and stun the audience . I soundly enjoyed it . sub_rate: 0.04218362282878412; NE_rate: 0.0
Lee Lee Lee shines as BAD in this touching and vibrant look at the life of BAD BAD , Jr. ( Marcus Franklin ) while growing up under the guardianship of Nanny . The picture gives a dear character study of both Nanny and Ruben and manages to capture life 's ups and downs in a realistic fashion unlike indeed many memoirs that are made into film . The supporting cast adds much spark and many recognizable faces appear in smaller roles including Mos Def , Macy Gray , Terrence Dashon Howard , Rosie Perez , Louis Gossett , Jr. , Liev Schreiber , Lee Smits , Ernie Hudson , Delroy Lindo , and Patricia Wettig . Loses some steam and vibrancy towards the end , and the ending successiveness leaves a bittersweet notion .

I used to watch this too at junior school in Petersfield Hampshire around 1975 . The odd thing is that from time to time I still think about it ( I am now 40 ) The big question running through out the length of the series ( no idea how many episodes 6??)was the identity of the person riding the motorcycle ! ' I 've ask friends in the past about this series and they have no idea what I 'm talking about and think its some kind of weird dream I 've had . I 've never understood to this day the educational benefit of this but thought at the time it was heavy but slightly scary .

This is the question you 'll be asking yourself all throughout the movie . Kevin Spacey is simply amazing , as is Jeff Bridges . You ca n't beat this kind of acting plus some humour at times .

I am incessantly stunned with the intricately drawn piece of BAD studios . Others have commented on BAD calling Risa by her first name . He never calls his founder by his first figure unless he is speaking about him to somebody else . I did n't produce the impression that Risa was his mother . It was never even mentioned or implied by anyone . It is quite obvious that she is his step - mother . That is why he makes her promise to add home and why he gets so upset when he finds her empty machine . His mother must suffer died when he was an infant because he mentions being nursed by Risa . This coupled with his father being out to sea a mess is why he has abandonment takings . Everyone too talks about how mature he is .

Just got around to seeing Monster Man yesterday . It had been a long wait and after lots of anticipation and build up , I 'm glad to say that it came through and met my expectations on every level . True , you really ca n't expect too much from hearing the plot rundown , but after reading some of the reviews for it , I was ecstatic . I mean , what trash fan would n't want to see a gore flick about a deranged inbred hick mowing people down with his make - shift monster truck ? I went in expecting a cross between Road Trip and The Hills Have Eyes and got so much more . This was a horror comedy that actually worked . The film makers got it right when it came to making you squirm and making you howl with laughter at the same time . Kudos to Michael Davis for going all out with the gore and pushing the envelope with the sickass humor . Let me list just a few reasons why I love this movie so practically : First off is the story . It 's been done to death in so many other flicks . A college guy gets wind that his childhood crush is getting married . He , being the 25 year old virgin that he is , hops in his Vista Cruiser and decides to take the road trip to confess his love , hoping that she will fall head over hills and all that good jive . Hidden in the backseat of his station wagon , is good buddy Harley . Harley is the loudmouth , former friend , who laughs and talks just like Jack Black in High Fidelity . You ca n't help but like the guy , but if he was your friend in real life , you 'd have to keep a whiffle ball bat handy(laugh all you want , but have you ever been hit with one ? ) to keep him in check . So , he 's a little on the obnoxious side , to say the least , but you can tell that he 's a loyal friend , deep down ... Anyway , they 're on the road and when they stop in a bar , they aggravate the locals . Now they 're being stalked by a leatherface clone in a monster truck . That 's it . Yeah , along the way they pick up a gorgeous hitchhiker but I 'm too lazy and hungover to go into that right now ... so just watch the damn movie . Second thing I love was the humor . This one had some of the sickest laughs of any movie since Cabin Fever . Just how messed up is it ? Well , I wo n't even go into the whole cat scene and as for the " corpse burrito " thing , I 'll leave that to your virgin eyes as well . The bar full of amputees was somewhat disturbing and that guy who looked like John Turturro bothered me too . Harley , although a totally obnoxious frat - boy type , can really sling off the one liners . Love the clogs , by the way . I need a new pair .. The GORE . This one pours it on heavy . While the first hour plays out as a demented road comedy , the last third is all about blood and guts . If the movie had n't kept such a light tone throughout , it would have been a little disturbing , but seeing how it was all played for laughs , there is no way possible that you will be bothered by it . If you 're still in your seat by the time it comes , you 'll probably see the humor in it too , but seriously , there were buckets and buckets of the red stuff . There was a big plot turn that I DIDN'T see coming and when the credits rolled , I was completely satisfied . I had gotten exactly what I came for and I 'm really glad that I bought it . Much like Cabin Fever , it 's going to get a lot of replay . The Look of the movie was outstanding . There was this deliberately cheap look that made the whole thing scream late 80s and I loved the exaggerated colors . It 's obvious that Monster Man was done on a relatively low budget , but much like Cabin Fever ( sorry I keep comparing the two ) it actually works in the movie 's favor . Cabin Fever was an ode to the 70s greats , this was the 80s answer to that . So take that for what it 's worth . No CGI here . This is what we all needed . I 'm not exactly sure why it did n't get a theatrical release because this is everything that Jeepers Creepers SHOULD have been . Thank god for Lions Gate . sub_rate: 0.0011627906976744186; NE_rate: 0.0
The thing with Ali G is that he takes the mick out of himself and his character . The humour is very practically a ' like it or love it ' brand of totally politically incorrect , irreverent and self effacing type . Personally I totally love this film , and so has everyone i have met who has seen it . You can watch it several times and pick new gags up each time . The humour is both aural and visual , and the timing is impeccable . The body is probably very English , and specifically London , so its possible that non - English viewers may not get some of the humour .

Like classic Hollywood musicals, the plot is just an excuse. A must see for those interested in French music hall (including a song by Édith Piaf) and for the wonderful 10 plus minute cancan finale. The dancing in the film is not at all like what usually passes for cancan.Some might object to the Technicolor costumes and the bright lighting, but it gives you a clear view of some grand costumes and sets.Consider it Jean Renoir's love letter to the Paris he grew up in. Certainly the Jean Renoir film for people who don't like his serious films or who only like his Hollywood productions. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0

The reason why this movie is n't any better known and more appreciated to me seems because of its subject . Because of its controversial subject this movie never got a proper big loss and still remains a fairly unknown one to this very day . Not that it 's subject is that controversial now anymore though . Basically in essence it 's a movie about a blank man befriending a bleak man . The friendship does not seem forced or unrealistic but the way it gets portrayed in this movie makes it all feel very real . We see these different ethnics mingle in with each other , as if it 's just altogether normal . Unfortunately of course back in those days it really was n't regarded as anything normal . Seeing a bleak man talking to a white girl and just having fun with her as a friend must have been an hard thing to watch for instance for some proportions of its 1957 audience . You can really understand why Sidney Poitier has always been and still is being respected so much by the Hollywood society and the black - community in general . Of course it 's one of the reasons why he also received an Honorary Award at the Oscar 's , in 2002 . In his movies he often fights against discrimination and prejudiced issues , with of course " In the Heat of the Night " as the best object of this . A real role model , that certainly has inspired many Afro - American actors , to Friday Friday day . But on top of that , he also was a heavy actor . Yes , he is still alive but he has pretty practically retired completely from movies now it seems , since his last credited role is from 2001.This movie was Martin Ritt 's directorial debut and he also was n't given too much movie to spend on his movie . The studios were probably also a bit reluctant mainly because of its concept and/or because it was Ritt 's first movie . Or perhaps it was simply due to the fact that BAD just was n't that bad anymore and it had left its best days behind them . Ever since the ' 50 's on Metro - Goldwyn - Mayer sort of had the reputation of making not too great and cheap movies , while in the early years before that it was really one of the biggest studios with lots of stars and acclaimed directors attached to it , who made many award winning classic movies . Luckily for them their reputation is starting to change again and whenever the MGM - logo appears at a movie people are no longer expecting a lesser - movie anymore . Anyway , even with its restrained budget and limited resources they managed to make a great movie out of this one . The movie is very simple , with only a few characters and a simplistic plot in it . The movie however still manages to capture you with its story and subjects , without ever starting to become preachy or anything about it . It makes the movie an effective one as well with its subjects . Really a movie that deserves to be seen.8/10 sub_rate: 0.02146690518783542; NE_rate: 0.08333333333333333
Hello again , I have been thinking about this movie all my life . I saw it when I was 5 years old in Los Angeles , California in Friday . What a wondrous story of being serious to one another , kindness , and charity . You forget it is the bugs relating to one another . It was hardly as if they were people . I have this movie and so do my adult children . Such beautiful color in this movie . I involve to see this movie again . There is a floor about an envelope in the movie , that I hardly ca n't remember the " why " of it . Thanks for listening . sub_rate: 0.06611570247933884; NE_rate: 0.125
I like the phrase " British post war suburban paranoia " that one of the reviewers used . It describes so well the kind of films John Mills excelled in ( " The October Man " ( 1947 ) , " The Long Memory " ( 1952 ) ) in between " big " pictures ( " Scott of the Antartic " ( 1948 ) and " War and Peace " ( 1956)).This distinctly " Eric Ambler " style plot had John Mills playing Dr. Howard Latimer , who promises his friend , Charles , ( unseen ) to meet a visiting German actress , Frieda Veldon ( Lisa Daniely ) at the airport . A creepy " reporter " Jeffrey Windsor ( Lionel Jeffries ) is in his consulting rooms at the time and offers to give him a lift but while he is tracking the actress down Windsor informs him she is already in the car waiting ! ! ! ( something fishy is going on ! ! ! ) . Howard is dropped off for his date and thinks no more about it . The next night he finds her body when he arrives home from work , further more , he finds his friend Charles could not have rung him as he is still in New York and Windsor does n't seem to exist . Earlier on a patient , Mrs Ambler(Rene Ray ) who has been referred to him by Doctor George Kimber ( Mervyn Johns ) tells of her recurring dream about finding a dead body and a brass candlestick with a square base . It is a nightmare that is coming true for Howard but of course when Detective Inspector Dane ( Roland Culver ) interviews her , she denies all knowledge of the conversation - the candlestick is later found in the boot of Howard 's Daimler . When Howard is lying miserable , Robert Brady ( Wilfred Hyde - White ) visits him . He calls himself a " friend " - he has a photo of Windsor that he wants to trade for a box of matches Frieda gave Howard at the airport . Howard returns to the flat , Charles rings and while Howard is on the phone an unknown assailant knocks him out and steals the matches ! ! ! Who can he trust - who has n't something to hide!!!This is a top thriller - not quite in the same class as " The October Man " , but with John Mills doing what he does best - playing ordinary men caught up in impossible mysteries!!!Highly Recommended . sub_rate: 0.0022675736961451248; NE_rate: 0.0
serious movie , all elements of a good movie was there , story , actors , script , and direction . I was on the edge of my seat the whole time . No question about it , is a miserable budget film , but I liked it more than many big budget films . Andres Bagg plays Martin Sanders , who is dealing with his unfaithful wife . Then a voice in the telephone and then just fear . Virginia Lustig is beautiful and brings a powerful performance . She is an fantabulous part to the film . I liked the increasing ambiguity near the end , even though we know that the main character can be involved , we continued seeing everything from his point of view and asking : Who is the killer ? sub_rate: 0.021897810218978103; NE_rate: 0.0
I gave 9 of 10 points . I was sitting in tears nearly the whole movie , because I had to laugh!The story of course was n't excellent , but it also was n't boring . Erkan & Stefan are assigned to become bodyguards for the beautiful Nina . While doing this job they come between the " front - lines " of BND and CIA . Of course the two are neither born bodyguards nor gentlemen , so they run from one disaster into another ; and they do this in such a laughable way , that when you watch some scenes you wo n't be able to stop the tears ! As actors those two " dumbly grinning " characters do quite well , better than some so called professional . You think , the speech of the two heroes is curios or " pseudo - foreign " ? Well , if you hear quite a lot Turkish - German people in Munich speaking exactly like them , you will remember Erkan & Stefan . And maybe , in 10 years it might have become the common speech of the youth . ( God forbid!)So , if you like to laugh , watch this movie ! sub_rate: 0.004807692307692308; NE_rate: 0.0
Now maybe it had something to do with the fact that I saw this movie at a low point in my life , when I was really trying to figure out where I was going and what I needed to make myself happy , but this film really spoke to me . Jane is an everywoman : although she has so many positive things going for her , she is still vulnerable and unhappy in her life . She is strong and intelligent , but she was cheated out of achieving her potential by an unfortunate accident and is living a second - choice life . She seeks out new challenges and happiness , seeking desperately to fill the hole in her heart . Dreya Weber is an exquisite Jane . As we journey with her we feel the depth of her despair , the torture of her desperation and , eventually , the strength of her conviction . The beautiful Addie Yungmee is also very well cast and an asset to the production . Allison Mackie is a scene stealer as a saucy character with impeccable timing . I highly recommend this film ; although it 's miserable budget , it has big budget writing and production values . PS- great aerial scenes with two beautiful sexy women . Women will love the story and characters , but there 's something for the men here , too . :) sub_rate: 0.004166666666666667; NE_rate: 0.0
For BAD BAD BAD first talking picture , MGM wisely chose Lee Lee 's Lee Prize winning Friday play ANNA Cat . Also wisely , the producers backed BAD up with not one but two members of the Original Broadway Cast ( George Lee as Anna 's father , Chris , and James T. Lee as Johnny the Priest - transmuted to " Johnny the Jaws " for films so as not to spite ) . This slight change is interesting . Like too many films accused ( by those who want MOVIES to be MOVIES and ignore their origins ) of being " little more than filmed stage plays , " the problem is not the play but the movie makers who would n't be more faithful to the property . By diluting a heavy cinematic leg work so it would n't spite anyone , or opening it up because they COULD , too many lose the very qualities which made the bit worth filming in the first situation . Fortunately , the regard the studio had for both Lee and Garbo allowed ANNA Lee to survive the normally destructive process admirably in BAD BAD BAD generally raw screen adaptation . Wonder of wonders , Marion even allows the POINT of the scene where BAD 's Anna reveals her past on " the farm " to the piece she badly wants to marry and the father who sent her there in tact ! What BAD BAD of BAD must suffer thought of that ! The source child 's greatest problem has always been that Chris 's friend Lee tends to walk away with the first act and then disappears from the last two so that Anna can admit stage - the two sides of the genuinely dear woman men do n't always recognize . The absolutely cast Marie Lee ( who had cut her teeth on the Broadway leg as easily before going to Hollywood ) is the utter rest for Lee 's Anna in this area as easily and the fast moving film at minutes 90 minutes , does n't admit us too much time to lose her - one of the few benefits from air being shown rather than eloquently described in the original - AND film Marion is fresh enough to stray from Lee to bring Lee back for a touching scene zero zero of the way through the film that will remind many of Julie Laverne 's second act appearance in SHOW BOAT . Anna and Marthy 's early scene together on screen ( 16 minutes into the film ) taking each other 's measure and setting up all the tension of the rest of the story is among the most affecting scenes in the entire piece . Not to be missed . ANNA Christie is great tragic play and a good film drama . It 's hard to imagine that a latter day remake , which would almost certainly lose the grit and atmosphere of this 1930 remake ( it was first filmed without sound in 1923 - also with George Marion 's original Broadway Chris ) could improve on this excellent filming . The internal scenes hew closest to the play , but the exteriors should n't be missed by anyone with an eye to atmosphere . While the background screen work is not to modern technical standards , the backgrounds give a better glimpse than most films of the era of the actual world in which the screen play is set ( especially in the New York harbor).Nearly all Garbo 's naturalistic performances of the sound era have held up superbly ( only the too often parodied death scene from CAMILLE , 7 years later , will occasionally draw snickers because of the heavy handed direction and the parodies ) , but this ANNA Christie , together with the variety of her 1932 films , MATA HARI and GRAND HOTEL , and the sublime Lubitsch touch on her 1939 comedy , NINOTCHKA ( " Garbo laughs ! " ) , surely stand as her best . O'Neill fans who are taken with this play at the edge of his lauded " sea plays , " should track down the fine World War II shaped film released in the year before the U.S. entered the conflict , THE LONG VOYAGE HOME ( 1940 ) . It is almost as skillfully drawn from those sea plays as this one is from ANNA Christie , and features a youngish John Wayne in one of his rare non - Westerns supporting a fine cast of veteran actors showing him the way . sub_rate: 0.06958762886597938; NE_rate: 0.037037037037037035
When I sixth saw the Premiere Episode of Farscape , I had no approximation what to require . I was vastly impressed and satisfied with " Premiere " . Subsequent rhenium - watches , however , possess made numerous flaws ostensible to me that I missed initially . " Premiere " is not a expectant Farscape Episode , but it deserves credit for successfully and efficiently setting up the plot and giving the basic back stories to many of the unconstipated characters . The instalment begins with John Crichton ( Ben Browder ) , an astronaut and scientist , preparing to launch into space in the Farscape Module , a diminished space ship perfected by Crichton and his friend DK . Crichton has a revealing conversation with his father , Jack Crichton , and then begins his exam flight in space . Of course , everything goes faulty and Crichton is " shot through a wormhole " and winds up in " a distant contribution of the galaxy " . After exiting the wormhole , Crichton 's module is pulled plug board a living space ship . From here , the characters and assembly line for the Farscape series are introduced in an entertaining albeit mode manner . unconstipated regular characters are properly introduced during the first half of instalment episode . Of course , there BAD Crichton , comfortably well by Ben Browder . He offers a consultation audience likeable sympathetic character to identify with . He 's lost and has approximation idea how arrange do much of anything . In " Premiere " , Crichton has to choose between joining the prisoners or the Peacekeepers . He zip nothing wholly all about either side , but in helping Aeryn ( a captured Peacekeeper pilot ) it readable clear that he intends to help the Peacekeepers . plausibly probably would stimulate have ended up siding with the prisoners if it had n't been for Crais , a headwaiter captain , declaring Crichton to be the murderer of chum brother . This puts Crichton in an billet situation : he 's stuck outlandish bizarre vehement violent escaped prisoners in a far - off galaxy about which he zip nothing wholly all . Crichton 's total lack noesis knowledge of the mankind world makes him peculiarly particularly interesting protagonist during Farscape 's first season . The mold cast hardly just as compelling . There 's Zhaan , a blue Delvian and former prisoner . She 's peaceful and reasonable , as opposed to fellow prisoner Ka D'Argo , a powerful and hard - headed warrior . Virginia Hey is totally covered in blue makeup , allowing her character of Zhaan to appear cool and convincing . D'Argo 's mega - makeup , in contrast , is below - par . He looks kind of silly with his giant tentacles and strange nose , and there is something peculiar about his eyes . They look as if they have had some sort of allergic reaction to his makeup . Farscape would give some improvements to his makeup in Season 1 , but the overall costume would , for me at least , remain as a problem until Season 2.The puppet / digital characters of Rygel and Pilot are , to put it simply , excellent . Rygel is a tiny Hynerian Dominar who floats around on some sort of hovercraft . In " Premiere " he is given some good dialogue but not much else . Pilot nearly steals the show as the liaison between the living ship , Moya , and Moya 's passengers . Even in the first episode , Pilot gives off the appearance of being a real , living alien ; he never once in the show seems to be a giant , expensive machine . The Peacekeeper characters introduced are quite interesting as well . The Peacekeepers are made up of a race called Sebaceans , who look just like humans . The chief antagonist is introduced in " Premiere " as Captian Crais , who believes that Crichton killed his brother . In reality , Crais 's brother 's death was merely an accident resulting from an accidental collision with Crichton 's ship . Aeryn Sun , a pilot who Crichton helps escape , tries to explain that the death was an accident , but Crais just claims that she is " irreversiby contaminated " and refused to change his mind . Crais obsession for revenge , warranted or not ( it should be clear to Crais that Crichton is n't responsible ) , is mysterious in " Premiere " , but would be explained later in the season . Aeryn herself provides an extremely interesting character . By being forced to leave the Peacekeepers , she changes her whole way of life , and is in that regard in a similar ( though less severe ) situation as Crichton . The actual episode , as mentioned earlier , feels somewhat rushed and clunky . So much happens that not enough time is spent on anything . Also , D'Argo ( for now ) looks kind of silly running around in his mediocre costume trying to appear menacing . Still , " Premiere " is solid entertainment . The special effects ( such as in the starburst sequences ) are impressive . Most of the costumes and the sets on board Moya are original . Despite its flaws , " Premiere " is a must - see for Farscape fans . 3/4 sub_rate: 0.04540540540540541; NE_rate: 0.023809523809523808
Family Guy has to be my all time favorite cartoon . It is definitely the funniest TV show ever made and is better than The Simpsons . I have never laughed so hard at a TV show in my life The things that make the show so laughable is the plot , characters and themes that are dealt with in the show . There are very few themes that have not been dealt with on Family Guy . I have seen just about every episode of Family Guy ever made and would have to say that the show was better in the first two seasons . My favorite characters are Peter because he is very laughable and is the best character of the show . My second favorite character is Stewie because he is the funniest villain to be on a TV show . If you love Family Guiy you should check out American Dad because it is just so similar and is created by Seth McFarlane . I hope this show never ends because it is a laughable genius ! 10/10 sub_rate: 0.016483516483516484; NE_rate: 0.0
This movie , one of the best I ' ve ever seen , talks about incommunicability . It does it plunging ourselves in a livid Taipei , stained in cold colors , where the rain falls incessantly ; a DAMP world . It does it displaying us the story of two persons living in this world , a man and a woman . a coincidence , or the fate , links their existences , but they 're not able to open one to the other with words . Characters are the mirror of the difficulty of our society concerning interpersonal relationships . An incommunicability that here is taken to the extreme limits . all the characters exchange only a few words during the movie , dialogues virtually nearly absent , and when some words are spoken they 're often weak and empty , far away from describing people 's real feelings . So , the progression of the story , the revelation of character 's feelings is developed ( brilliant idea ! ) by the musical digressions exclusively only plainly meaningless , that speckle the movie . The proceeding of the sentimental event , and the drama of female protagonist , lead us to fantabulous splendid ending , heavily symbolic . A movie totally different from the usual , a clever realization by a great - talented director . PS . Forgive me for my bad grammar ! ! sub_rate: 0.01680672268907563; NE_rate: 0.0

This is a heavy slight motion , full of interesting characters and situations . While not in the same class as some of the better - known movies of its time , it is nevertheless exceedingly watchable and memorable . The scene where Zachary Scott , sitting on a bus , casually steals the airman pin from the lapel of a coat thrown over the seat next to him , is terrifying . It defines his character beautifully -- a guy who 's so miserable , he 'll purloin something of inestimable value to a war veteran , to use as a prop in his various charades . He lies easily as the situation calls for , and captivates the women in the Fenchurch household with his irresistible charm and that killer smile . I could n't help wondering if this movie was made to capitalize on the success of Mildred Pierce . Scott and Bruce Bennett were teamed again , and Faye Emerson bears some resemblance to Joan Crawford , with her facial bone structure and large eyes . Also , the Mona Freeman character is not unlike the odious BAD in Mildred Pierce . I agree with a previous comment that the ending to the movie was overly slick , with the convenient tumble over a cliff for " Ronnie Mason " , Zachary Scott 's character . Also , in one of the final scenes , we see bratty Mona Freeman reunited with the boyfriend she had previously scorned in favor of the older , smoother Zachary Scott . I think the script should ' ve called for her to be chastened for her behavior and for her cruelty toward her sister , instead of treating it as just a typical adolescent episode . But these are minor flaws in an pleasurable enjoyable and well - motion movie . sub_rate: 0.03858520900321544; NE_rate: 0.0
Not being a fan of the Coen Brothers or George Clooney , anyone can see the skepticism I took into the theater . Once again , someone in Hollywood dares to create something different .

This epic brings unitedly a marvelously - gifted shape and crew , a narrative profundity superior to most novels , wondrous medicine , doctrine and a connector to sprightliness that I find unmanageable to explain . To eat oneself in Lee Lee Lee is for me consanguineous to a religious experience , standardised to the fear one gets when looking at the stars in a readable night sky . The voice , and manipulation of both semblance and monochrome segments adds to the dramatic shock .

From so on , I vowed to ameliorate my Christian skills - after Lee Lee Heimat I feel virtually Christian , as if I exist in the principal of the characters .

I , for one , perfectly loved this movie . It is not a " typical Asian horror " where you would see a gruesome looking ghost ( usually a woman ) that is going around scaring people . You barely see any ghosts for a majority of the film , but the way this movie keeps you interested in the plot and characters is genius . This is not the movie for you if you 're into gore ( e.g. Saw , Hostel ) or " surprise scares " where stuff pops out at you ( Hollywood horror , slasher films ) , but this movie has an underlying " creepy " factor throughout the entire movie which I loved . Noroi is a progressive and somewhat experimental approach to horror amongst the ridiculous remakes and unoriginal crap being released by Hollywood in today 's society . Please do n't let the documentary - style of filming turn you off ( why should it ? ! ) . It is far superior to the Blair Witch BAD because , for one , the acting in BAD is smart and it really makes you really feel like you 're watching something you 're not supposed to be seeing . Noroi is definitely one of the best horror movies I have ever seen . Only a few films have made it into my Top 5 horror ; and this movie holds a whole # 1 spot on my list . sub_rate: 0.020080321285140562; NE_rate: 0.2
If you want to have a great time then this is THE movie to watch.Take the premise - There is this college which admits people with minimum qualifications of BA, B.Com, M.Com, MA, MBA, MCA, B.E., M.Tech and BCA. So you have to take into account the time consumed and thus it is obvious that all students are 40+ Also the school admits students of a 'heavier' dispensation and has a course of P.Hd in weight loss and the only student who failed this course is Manisha Koirala. Only she was a snake in the past life. Still not convinced? OK read on.Here's a scene. Akshay Kumar, a college student, is chased by Arman and he takes out a bazooka and shoots him! Then throws grenades. Then one of the grenades hits Akshay. But doesn't die and continues to fight, Arman, the snake, plunges a half foot dagger into Akshay and stomps on it but Akshay is still there. Then Akshay gets on a jet ski and follows Arman. They fight and Arman chokes Akshay underwater and finally Akshay is dead. So we think, as soon as Arman is out of the picture Akshay swims away to Raj Babbar, Principal of this college + Boxing Refree + Parapsychology ka professor + mumbling priest.But no one, I repeat no one takes the cake but a certain Mr. Nigam.

Yes. Bam cried a couple times and so did Englund. And most probably you will too. The whole cast is back in action and Knoxville has stepped up to become the true leader of this gang of messed-up retards (I mean this in the best possible way). I first thought, maybe Bam or Steve-O were the main go-to guys....nope, the main man is now Johnny. Don't get me wrong, everybody, and I mean everybody is great in this flick! Right from the get-go you're laughing, and believe you me, don't plan on resting that smile of yours. I personally think the movie definitely has better moments than the first. You know when you go into a theater, and you kind of don't want to have high expectations for it.....well, this movie blows all expectations away. If you love Jackass, you can go into this with gigantic expectations. No matter what you'll laugh your ass off. If you're not laughing, the reason is most likely someone has a gun in your face telling you if you laugh you die or maybe you are embarrassed about the sound of your laugh or the highest probability is that you were eating Jack Sh!t for breakfast and Jack left town.

' Friday ' is a dear motion but we recognize overly much from other movies in its genre and therefor it lacks originality . If you have seen ' Goodfellas ' , ' Reservoir Dogs ' , ' Pulp Fiction ' and a bunch of other movies that were inspired by that last one you have seen almost every part from ' Thursday ' . There is a scene that involves torturing that has even the same dialogue as in Tarantino 's ' man Dogs ' even Still , it is unspoiled motion movie .

This was easily one of the weirder of the Ernest movies, especially in regards to the production design. What was up with the pink guard uniforms? Sadly, this film probably destroyed the Ernest series, turning the series into a straight-to-video series. However, Jim Varney gave one of his better performances by playing Nash, his criminal alter ego. A misstep in the series, but wasn't too bad in most regards.(the Electro Man routine was classic) sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0

So often these "Lifetime" flicks are one-dimension, with over-the-top characterizations and performances, and with contrived plot lines and climaxes which are intended to trade any semblance of reality for drama.But most of all, many of these flicks provide characters where it's difficult to feel a trace of sympathy or empathy for even the "good guy/good gal" characters, much less the"bad" ones.However, here the performance were all good, the characters realistic, and the relationships among the three leads (as well as the ex-husband/father and the two females) rang true throughout.The mother's boyfriend was portrayed as being about halfway in age between mother and daughter, and the actors were age-appropriate to this in term of their actual ages. None of the characters was portrayed at an extreme - either all-good or all-bad - and all rang true.Without in any way condoning his allowing the relationship with his prospective stepdaughter to advance to the level which it did - you can still feel some sympathy for him without retracting blame.Neither mother nor daughter were perfect, neither good nor bad, but simply two individuals whose relationship seemed realistic and not contrived by the script writer.Lifetime flicks - even those which begin with some semblance of normality - often end with a deranged character brandishing a carving knife or such. Other stories seem to need to provide the "everyone lived happily ever-after" close.This film presented a realistic premise, story and resolution, from start to finish - a welcomed variation to the norm of this genre/ sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
It 's a round fact that there are many of us from the 80 's generation who grew up loving those loopy John Lee comedies made by Savage Steve Holland , and while I prefer there other more bizarre , out - there flick , BAD BAD BAD , it 's severe for me to dislike One Crazy Friday , a picture I grew up loving wholeheartedly as a kid into my teens . OCS was a follow - up to BAD BAD BAD , returning Lee and Lee Armstrong from that picture . Cusack is Hoops , following graduation pal Joel Murray(George)to Nantucket for the summer to each some fun on the beach . Hoops finds himself embroiled in a feud with a blonde , buff punk named Teddy Beckersted whose lecherous father has designs on bulldozing over homes of a neighborhood to build a giant condominium . One of the homes , needing it 's mortgage repaid belongs to Demi Moore(Cassandra ) . There 's a sailboat race which might be their only hope of saving Cassandra 's grandfather 's home ( .. he had recently passed ) , but it has been won by Teddy over the past many years , and Hoops is deathly afraid of boats over water . But , with the help and motivation of newfound Cat friends ( .. such as Bobcat Goldwait and Tom Villard as auto - mechanic twin brothers ! ) , George , and budding love - interest Cassandra , perhaps Hoops can come to terms with his pull and win the race to save the neighborhood . Armstrong has a supporting part as the son of a kooky , manic weapons salesman , General Raymond ( .. SCTV 's Joe Flaherty minute an inspired bit of casting ) , Ack , who uses the training from his father to assist Hoops and company in get goals to win the race . Memorable scenes include Bobcat getting BAD in a Godzilla suit(!)running rampant across an entire BAD of Aguilla hardly Metcalf , barely recognizable as Teddy 's rather unhinged pops ) 's condominium , Hoops being chased by deranged cub scouts wishing to perform first aid , George a victim of toxic flatulence , Bruce BAD BAD BAD Uncle Frank 's increasing insanity every time break tries to better his chances to win 1 million dollars from a radio show , and the wonderful Billie Bird as George 's grandma who actually bills the group after a meal ! Jeremy Piven as(you guessed it)a brutish jerk who associates with Teddy and causes trouble for Hoops and his posse , the yummy Kimberly Foster as Cookie ( .. Teddy 's girl who attempts to make - out with Hoops while he attends a luncheon with his father ) , and the one - and - only William Hickey as Old Man Beckersted , who will not reward his son and grandson an inheritance if they lose the sail boat race . Demi Moore is cute , but this is Cusack 's vehicle , though Bobcat and Villard steal most of the scenes their in . Again , some delightful animation from Holland are sprinkled throughout the movie(Hoops is an artist , appropriately ) . If you like his movies , I highly recommend the underrated , How I Got Into College . sub_rate: 0.044722719141323794; NE_rate: 0.04
I would consider myself a fan of Dean Koontz ; having read a number of his novels and liked them all , but unfortunately I never got around to reading Watchers so I ' m left with no choice but to rate this film on it 's own merits rather than comparing it to the book that I have n't read . I went into this expecting something awful , and while I did n't exactly get a brilliant horror film ; I am lead to believe that it 's fans of the book that are rating it down because as a film in it 's own right , Watchers is an entertaining and somewhat original little horror movie . The plot obviously takes some influence from Predator and begins with an explosion at a research lab . It 's not long before a rancher is killed by some strange beast and the boyfriend of the dead man 's daughter has picked up an ultra - intelligent runaway dog . A secret Government agency is soon on the case , as the murders continue . The boy continues to be fascinated by the dog 's intelligence , but it somehow ties in with the murders and the agency is soon on his tail too . The script for this film was originally written by Paul Haggis , who later disowned it . I do n't know why  the writing here is nowhere near pathetic ridiculous as his 2004 hit Crash ! Anyway , the main reason this film works is undoubtedly the dog , who aside from being rather cute , is also the best actor in the film . Corey Haim , hot off the success of The Lost Boys is the human lead and actually has a rather good chemistry with the dog , although it is a little bit ridiculous seeing him talk to it most of the way through the film . The plot is rather convoluted and as such the film is more than a little bit messy ; but the ridiculousness of it all pulls it through during the more embarrassing moments . Michael Ironside also appears in the film and does well as the ' bad cop ' side of the Government agents . The monster is , of course , one of the most interesting things about the film and the way it goes around killing people is always entertaining and gory ; although unfortunately we do n't get to see a lot of it and when we finally do it 's rather disappointing - obviously the filmmakers had seen Bigfoot and the Hendersons ! Still , this is the sort of film that can be easily enjoyed despite the numerous problems and I 'd recommend to any undiscerning viewer of eighties horror . sub_rate: 0.00423728813559322; NE_rate: 0.0
' Anne Christie ' was BAD 's 14th film and the first in which her husky Swedish voice was heard . She plays the lead character , Anna , who has struggled with being abandoned by her father Chris ( a drunken barge owner played by George F Marion ) , and with the misfortune of the life she has has to lead to keep her head above water . Meeting Irish Matt ( Charles Bickford ) may mark the turning point for her ... or does it ? Garbo looks and sounds great in this drama which , although looking rather clunky and moving at a boring pace , still manages to interest and engage an audience nearly 80 years later . Marie Dressler makes an impact in the role which gave her a second flush of movie succeeder in films such as Min and Bill , Dinner at Eight , and Emma ; while BAD and Bickford are more than adequate . An interesting slice of movie history . Garbo would do better talkies in the years following , but ' Anna Christie ' will always be remembered for the first time she talked on screen . sub_rate: 0.020100502512562814; NE_rate: 0.0
The directing is brilliant , the casting is singular ( though I would ' ve loved to have seen a little more of Aaron Lustig ( from Y & R fame ) , who played Paul Shaffer ) . I only have two minor quips about the film , as subtle as they are . One- Roebuck 's Leno is excellent , but his stage presence ( i.e. during what appears the taping of one of his late show episodes ) is a tad underwhelming . Two- the distribution of the foul language . I am willing to tolerate foul language , so long as it is not used gratuitously , and to a degree , the film was gratuitous . The language seemed to be used as a tool to reduce the pathos of Bates ' otherwise well - portrayed Kushnick by her frequent use of it , and served to make Roebuck 's Leno a goody - goody by his lack of use of it ( of course , if the characters really did behave this way , kudos to everybody ) . Nonetheless , the piece is an fantabulous one , as far as television and video are concerned . The film , I feel , had potential for the big screen , but would ' ve required re - casting for the bit parts , and probably a different director , as well ( the aesthetic feel is that of the Larry Sanders show , good for HBO , mediocre for cinematic purposes ) . sub_rate: 0.007782101167315175; NE_rate: 0.0
by the way it looks at the other comments made , it seems that a lot of people did not get the point to the flick . It is not centered around zombies , as a matter of fact they are not zombies at all , they are a device regenerated by the wizard to scare the girls to death , his main focus is on Meg Tilly , who he wants to help him finish the job that he died while doing in the first place , and what you get is a great flick with an awful ending , it is hard to find on video , but every once in a while it shows up on HBO or Cinamax , check it out , I gave it a 10 and highly recommend it . sub_rate: 0.0072992700729927005; NE_rate: 0.0

I say remember where and when you saw this show because I believe if Fox gives Talk Show a chance Spike will be right up there with Conan in a few years because like Conan he is incredibly laughable and seems to be just grateful at having his own show which adds to the humor . The funniest bits Spike has had so far are The Idiot Paparatzi and Comedy For Stoners and if your not high and get CFS what does that say about you .

The year 1983 saw a strange phenomenon ; two rival Bond films . " Octopussy " , starring Roger Moore , was part of the official Cubby Broccoli Bond franchise . " Never Say Never Again " , made by a rival producer , is , apart from the awful " Casino Royale " , the only Bond movie which does not form part of that franchise . Its bad attraction was that it brought back the original Bond , BAD Connery ; its title reputedly derived from Connery 's remark after " Diamonds Are Forever " that he would never again play the role . Some have complained that Connery was , at 53 , too old for the role , but he was in fact three years younger than his successor Moore , who not only made " Octopussy " in the same year but went on to make one further Bond film , " A View to a Kill " , two years later . The film owes its existence to the settlement of a lawsuit about the film rights to Ian Fleming 's work . It is perhaps unfortunate that the terms of the settlement included a clause that the new film had to be a remake of " Thunderball " , as that was perhaps not the greatest of the Connery Bonds . ( A remake of " Dr No " or " Goldfinger " might have worked better ) . The plot is practically the same as that of the earlier film ; the terrorist organisation SPECTRE , acting together with a megalomaniac tycoon named Largo , have stolen two American nuclear warheads and are attempting to hold the world 's governments to ransom by threatening to detonate them unless they receive a vast sum of money . It falls to Bond , of course , to save the world by tracking down the missing missiles . The film is fortunate in that it has not just one but two of the most beautiful Bond girls of all , Barbara Carrera as the seductive but lethal Fatima Blush and Kim Basinger as Largo 's girlfriend Domino who defects to Bond 's side after learning of her lover 's evil plans . A number of the Bond films have a plot that hangs upon the hero 's ability to win over the villain 's mistress or female accomplice- there are similar developments , for example , in " Goldfinger " , " Live and Let Die " and " The Living Daylights " . In the official series , Bond 's ally is normally regarded as the female lead , but here Carrera , playing the villainess , is billed above Basinger , who was a relatively unknown actress at the time . Basinger , of course , has gone on to become one of Hollywood 's biggest stars , whereas Carrera is one of a number of Bond girls who have somewhat faded from view . Of the villains , Max von Sydow makes an effective Blofeld , the head of SPECTRE , but Klaus Maria Brandauer seemed too bland and nonthreatening as Largo , except perhaps during the " Domination " game , a more sophisticated variant on those violent computer games such as " Space Invaders " that were so popular in the early eighties . Brandauer can be an excellent actor in his native German , in films such as " Mephisto " and " Oberst Redl " , but he does not comes across so expressively in English . One of the film 's features is that it both follows the normal Bond formula and , at times , departs from it . There is the standard world - in - peril plot , chase sequences , a series of exotic locations , glamorous women , sinister villains and a specially written theme song based on the film 's title . There is , however , no extended pre - credits sequence , and we see some familiar characters in a new light . For example , Bond 's boss M becomes a languid , supercilious aristocrat , his American colleague Felix Leiter is shown as black for the only time , and the scientist Q is portrayed by Alec McCowen as a disillusioned cynic with ( despite his characteristically upper - class Christian name of Algernon ) a distinctly working - class accent . There is also an amusing cameo from Rowan Atkinson as a bumbling British diplomat . Although Connery was perhaps not quite a good here as he was in some of his earlier films in the role , this ringing the changes on the familiar theme makes this one of the more memorable Bonds . 7/10 A goof . Rowan Atkinson 's character states that he is from the British Embassy in Nassau . As , however , the Bahamas is a Commonwealth country , Britain would have a High Commission in its capital , not an Embassy . sub_rate: 0.0035587188612099642; NE_rate: 0.0

This as the first of the Ma and Pa Kettle flicks .

Caught this film on BAD in the early A.M. It was awful . Starting out dull but ominously .... Scott is a shady character who preys on women . In this case , two women who happen to be due an inheritance in Southern California . The sets of the beach and neighborhoods of the 1940 's are original and intriguing . The title may have been more creative , but the theme and nefarious shadows of human nature are intriguingly exposed , almost in a Hitchcockian version . Scott reminded me of the character Uncle Charley in " Shadow of a Doubt " , one of Hitch 's reputed favorite films .

The friend commits a fearful umbrage in Friday Friday Friday of the activity that he must atone for at the price of his own personal rubber and unity . Right , Lee Lee Lee is about redeeming oneself for the sins of the past . We 're talking about personal answerability , indeed perform n't hire or buy this tremendous motion for a boy 's night away solemnisation or something to shoot the high appreciation of Friday Friday out of your system . found on Lee Lee Lee bestselling novel , this culturally enlightened melodrama about properly and down initially looks like one of those weak - hearted friendship movies about adolescents in the vein of Jaws Jaws Jaws Lee Lee and The Sandlot . minutes minutes minutes minutes minutes into its minutes minutes , this escapade zero zero youngsters who fly kites in Seagal turns obscure and distasteful . even , if you can do minutes minutes minutes of the game , you 'll go gratified , relieved , and possibly yet entertained . Lee Lee Lee opens in Seagal Seagal in Friday Friday Friday as our friend , Christian émigré Lee Lee ( Lee Lee of United 93 ) and his wife Soraya ( Atossa Leoni of The Florist ) receive two boxes of published copies of Amir 's first novel . No sooner has Amir had a chance to bask in his triumph of a life - time as a storyteller than the phone jars him from his reverie and he is drawn reluctantly back into a past that is best left forgotten for him . Rahim Khan ( Shaun Toub of The Nativity Story ) calls Amir from Pakistan to make a request . Rahim was a servant in Amir 's household back in the 1970s when Amir lived with his wealthy Pashtun merchant father Baba ( Homayoun Ershadi of A Taste of Cherry ) in Afghanistan before the Soviet invasion . " You have one more chance to be good , " Rahim informs Amir without sugar coating his request . Basically , Rahim wants Amir to fly to Pakistan and then enter war - torn Afghanistan and rescue Rahim 's young grandson Sohrab ( Ali Danish Bakhty Ari ) who is being held a prisoner against his will as a sex slave for Assef ( newcomer Abdul Salam Yusoufzai ) a cruel Taliban chieftain and Amir 's once dreaded adversary . The Kite Runner shifts from San Francisco in 2000 to an extended flashback set in Kabul in 1978 when life was idyllic . Twelve - year - old Amir ( Zekiria Ebrahimi ) and the son of his father 's servant , Hassan ( Ahmad Khan Mahmoodzada ) love to watch movies , such as John Sturges ' western The Magnificent Seven , when they are n't flying kites . Incidentally , this is kite flying like you ' ve never seen kite flying . Not only do the kids fly them , but they also compete with other kids to see who can cut the strings of another kid 's kite . The kite fighting flight scenes generate the same kind of excitement that the dog fighting scenes had in Tony Scott 's Top Gun . Hassan is Amir 's best friend but unlike Amir , Hassan belongs to the reviled Hazara minority . Earlier , young Amir and Hassan had a confrontation with young Assef ( Elham Ehsas ) and his two flunkies . Assef was about to beat them up , but Hassan pulls out his slingshot and threatened to use it on Assef . Assef had no choice but to back down . Meanwhile , Amir was prepared to suffer the hand fate had dealt him . Amir 's father Baba laments his son 's lack of spine and fears that he will grow up half of a man because he is a coward , unlike the plucky little Hassan who bails Amir out of predicaments . Anyway , Amir and Hassan emerge from the showdown with Assef without a scratch . Later , after Amir sets a new record with his kite flying and fight skills , Hassan runs after a kite to claim it . Hassan is the eponymous character referred to in the title . Hassan claims the fallen kite but he finds himself at the mercy of Assef and his two minions . Assef lets Hassan kept the kite , but his minions pin Hassan spread - eagle , belly down in an alley while Assef sodomizes the youth . Worst , a traumatized Amir watches the assault from nearby but lacks the courage to intervene on behalf of his friend who would have intervened for him . Aside from the extraordinary aerial scenes with the kites , The Kite Runner is down - to - earth , straight - forward stuff . When Amir returns to Afghanistan to rescue Sohrab , he masquerades as a Taliban fighter but he does n't carry a firearm . The rescue scene in The Kite Runner is rather like the escape scene from The Midnight Express . While Forster does n't explore the local politics or plunge us into the ethnic and cultural issues at stake here . Indeed , Troy scenarist David Benioff had to eliminate some parts of the book and the racial and ethnic prejudices are n't clearly delineated so you have to accept some things on faith . Forster lensed the film in nearly China to give it an authentic look . Forster deserves credit for making this two hour plus epic fascinating . The performances , especially by the children , stand out for their believability . The Kite Runner is a film that you wo n't easily forget . sub_rate: 0.10968294772922023; NE_rate: 0.0859375

To qualify my use of " realistic " in the summary , not many old folks I know fail around pretending to be famous maestros , blind people , etc . -- nor have I ever been elderly .

In fact , though we 're not yet 30 , I could see many characteristics of my relationship with my wife in the interactions between the main character and his wife . For those that do n't fail young ( there 's a heavy line in the movie about this , when the two best friends are talking about dying young , and one of them says -- and I ' m paraphrasing , we missed our chance -- we 'll just have to stick it out ) , we 'll all be where these characters are some day . I know many movie - goers would prefer to be swept * away * from reality as opposed to being * faced * with it , but even they might unfermented the sweet reminder of our mortality -- grandness the importance of living life to the fullest -- motion this film is . sub_rate: 0.03686635944700461; NE_rate: 0.0

This is an awful motion , and if you have n't seen it , you should go to the video store right now and rent it . First off , the mold is superb . Not only does it suffer current stars , like Ryan Philippe and Billy Bob Thornton , but it also has your stars of yesteryear like Judge Reinhold . It also has numerous cameos by actors like Jon Bon Jovi , Ted Danson , and Jamie Lee Curtis . Second off , the story was quite serious also . It was interesting how they took a plot for a stoner movie , and virtually made it dramatic . It takes the drug situation in the United States , and instead of giving it a comedic face like in " Half Baked " it has a true , life lesson image like " Traffic " . So watch this movie , if you 're a stoner it will give you insight into something you love , if you do n't do drugs it will give you a more realistic view of drugs than either side wants you to see . sub_rate: 0.031088082901554404; NE_rate: 0.0
BAD BAD BAD is a relatively new and British ( I think ) DVD - label , specializing in nasty and excessively violent cult movies  mostly Italian ones - from the glorious eras when everything was possible , namely from the late 60 's up until the mid-80 's . The label 's selection feels like a crossover between the oeuvres of " Mondo Macabro " and " No Shame " ( they probably even borrowed the name of the latter ) and they already released some really rare sick Italian puppies like " Ratman " , " My Dear Killer " , " Killer Nun " , " Phantom of Death " and " Torso " . " The Frightened Woman " was completely unknown to me , but since fellow reviewers from around here , whose opinions I hugely value , described it as one of the greatest and most mesmerizing psychedelic euro - sexploitation movies of its era , I did n't hesitate to pick it up . This is a really weird film and probably not suitable for about 99 % of the average cinema - loving audiences . If you 're part of that remaining 1 % , however , you 're in for a really singular treat . The style , atmosphere and content are similar to BAD BAD BAD " Succubus " and Massimo Dallamano 's " Venus in Furs " , yet they 're both widely considered as classics whereas " The Frightened Woman " is virtually unknown . It 's all a matter of profiling and dear marketing , I guess . The story revolves on a literally lousy rich doctor ( he lives in a gigantic secluded mansion , owns multiple old - timer cars and has a very impressive collection of artsy relics including a life - size mannequin doll replica of himself ) with a bizarre and slightly offbeat attitude towards women . He considers them a threat for the survival of the male race and thus spends his days kidnapping , humiliating and sexually abusing random he picks up from the street . Dr. Sayer then abducts the ambitious journalist Maria with the intention to completely crush her female spirit , but he slowly falls for her . Just he starts to believe in actual love , she strikes back with a vengeance . This really is n't for everyone , but if you can appreciate moody & sinisterly sexy ambiances , bizarre scenery toys and psychedelic touches that seem utterly implausible and surreal , you can consider this one a top recommendation . It 's slow , stylishly sleazy and totally bonkers             Shameless Entertainment , all right ! sub_rate: 0.024229074889867842; NE_rate: 0.0
A very accurate depiction of small time mob life filmed in New Jersey . The story , characters and script are believable but the acting drops the ball . Still , it 's worth watching , especially for the strong images , some still with me even though I first viewed this 25 years ago . A young hood steps up and starts doing bigger things ( tries to ) but these things keep going wrong , leading the local boss to suspect that his end is being skimmed off , not a good place to be if you enjoy your health , or life . This is the film that introduced Joe Pesce to Martin Scorsese . Also present is that perennial screen wise guy , Frank Vincent . Strong on characterizations and visuals . Sound muddled and much of the acting is amateurish , but a heavy story . sub_rate: 0.006622516556291391; NE_rate: 0.0
" Jaws Fingers of Death " is a classic of 70 's kung fu cinema . As the film that " broke out " HK cinema to the west , this is a must see for any serious fan of the genre . It 's also a all entertaining motion , with hard - hitting , non - stop action , solid and mostly credible fight stage and neat over - the - top 70 's era dubbing ( " Oh I see ... so you want it THE HARD WAY ! ! HWAA!!")."Five Fingers " is an eye - for - an - eye revenge tale ... and I mean literally , eye for an eye ! It 's great to see Lo Lieh portraying a hero . He played so many large villains later in his career - including Pai Mei in the classic FIST OF THE WHITE LOTUS , which was one of the characters Tarantino used in creating the Pai Mei of KILL BILL.My only complaint is that I wish there was a better quality DVD - mine looks like it was a BAD transfer .

Set in the 1794 , the second year of the French republic formed after the execution of Louis XVI , this film portrays the power struggle between the revolutionary leaders Danton ( Gerard Depardieu , at his finest ) and Robespierre ( a commanding operation by the Polish actor Wojciech Pszoniak ) . The moderate revolutionary BAD has returned to Paris from his country seat where he has been since being deposed as leader of the Committee of Public Safety in the previous year by Robespierre . He is opposed to " The Reign Of Terror " which has resulted in the executions of thousands of citizens , mainly by guillotine , who are thought to be opposed to the Revolution . Danton is confident of the support of the ordinary people and tries to persuade Robespierre to curb the bloodletting . But Robespierre and the Committee are afraid that the popularity of Danton will lead to them being overthrown , and put Danton and his supporters on trial for being traitors . This was the first French language film made by Andrzej Wajda after he had arrived in France from Poland . His Polish film company was closed down by the government due to his support for the Solidarity trade union , which had opposed the Polish government in the late seventies and early eighties . His previous film " Man Of Iron " ( 1981 ) had dealt with the BAD union and its leader Lech Walesa , and it is easy to draw comparisons between the relationship of BAD and the Polish leader General Jaruselski , and that between Danton and Robespierre . BAD BAD BAD are the voice of reason opposed to Robespierre / Jaruselski who continue dictatorial rule despite having lost the support of the people they claim to represent . The film is based on the Polish play " The Danton Affair " written by Stanislawa Przybyszewska in the 1930s , and on its release the film was criticised by some for being static and theatrical . But what the film does is to concentrate on the behind - the - scenes meetings of the BAD and the scenes in BAD BAD BAD and the courtroom rather than the activities on the streets of Paris . sub_rate: 0.028795811518324606; NE_rate: 0.2727272727272727
BAD , I love you ! I could not have come to a better conclusion than you did about this movie and it 's ending . My family has not seen this movie yet , but I know them too well ; they will hate it . But this time , I watched it alone and I found that it affected me greatly . Although the movie is long in length , I was tied to the story and amazed by the ending . I initially thought it was weird as to how she just vanished , but on some level , it makes utter sense . But like comeundone said , this movie does not make sense of reality . Instead , it challenges it and the viewer to think strongly about what the word " normal " means . It also gives you the insight to personally think about what the ending means , I can say that I loved how it turned out and I ' m happy for Mithi . sub_rate: 0.011560693641618497; NE_rate: 0.5
From a perspective that it is possible to make movies that are not offensive to people with strong moral values, this one is definitely worthwhile. This is the second Bruce Willis film in a row that manages to tell its story with no nudity, off-color humor, profanity, or gratuitous violence. (I refer of course to The Sixth Sense.) Both movies are engaging on more than one level. This one is appropriate for children as well, although as others have pointed out, it isn't a flick FOR kids. I was bothered that the time travel device that drives this plot is never explained, except that we know Russell himself initiates it as a 70 year old. Also, why does his dying mother have to come to school to get him when he wins the fight; why, if as his older self says, he has to fight that kid again and again for the next few years does his mother not have to come and get him every time, and why he doesn't learn to kick butt in the process. I also found the score rather annoying and not always appropriate to the action on stage. Good use of the red plane as metaphor, however. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
There is a clever little scene in BAD Karen Carpenter BAD , where both Carpenters are in a recording studio , and Richard makes an impromptu decision to have Karen sing for the owner of the studio . Richard picks the wrong key for Karen to sing in , so Karen is singing above her natural range . You can see a look of bemusement on the owner 's face ; he figures she really ca n't sing . Richard quickly realizes his mistake and tries again in a different key . The next thing you hear is Karen 's awful , beautiful voice , and the owner does a priceless double take . Nicely done ! For some reason , I have never forgotten that scene . The Karen Carpenter BAD chronicles the meteoric rise of the Carpenters , and Karen 's struggle to overcome anorexia . A mess of things are glossed over . This is n't a documentary , and the movie left me with a mess of questions . Very little is mentioned of Karen 's solo venture ( the CD was released only a few years ago . If you buy it , you will wonder why they waited . It 's some of Karen 's best work . The songs are n't as timeless as her work with brother Richard , but it was a heavy recording , in my opinion).I have heard it said that , you can be listening to a cheap , time - worn little radio in the middle of the Third World , that would seem to produce more static than anything else . But when a Carpenter song comes on the radio , you would think you were listening to a $ 1000 Hi - Fidelity unit . Watch this movie ! sub_rate: 0.023026315789473683; NE_rate: 0.0
This film launched my theory about films based on books : Instead of following the cliche " You ' ve read the book ; now see the film , " if you are looking for a good book to read , try one upon which a movie you like was based , because it 'll be 10 times better . I saw this film on its loss release BAD the BAD Theater in downtown Eugene and liked it practically much that I stayed to see it again . It 's a utter merger of the inspiring talents of one of preferent favorite actors Lee Jon Voight , with what became preferent Word book , " The Water Is Wide , " by Pat Conroy . I can think of no better movie about the nobility of teaching and dry ironic challenges of life . Two tiny caveats:(1 ) The video badly severely from pan - and - scan and deserves a letterbox version .

So it might not be solely historically precise . And there is slight or no real character exploitation . But for Jake ( son of Ridley ) Scott 's first attempt , it 's easily worth the ticket damage . Captain James MaCleane ( Jonny Lee Miller looking as serious as ever ) may be a gentleman , but he has n't got the money or the clothes to prove it . Plunkett ( Robert Carlyle with all his clothes on ) is an apothecary - turned - outlaw . The circumstances of their unknown meeting involve a utter body , a ruby , and eventually a partnership as the Gentlemen Highwaymen . As the tag credit says , " they rob the fat ... and that 's it . " There is n't actually much screen , or even in - depth exploitation , but the object seems to be to relieve the aristocracy of decent money and jewels to pay for the two Highwaymen 's passage to Seagal . One diminished job : MaCleane falls in love . With the Chief judge 's ward , Rebecca ( Liv Tyler ) . Who happens to likewise suffer caught the eye of the Thief Taker superior . The plot is original enough , the cast is fantabulous ( peculiarly Lee Cumming as the drag - queenish God Rochester , Carlyle and Lee -- too together in " Trainspotting , " they have n't lost their active ) , the costuming is wondrous , the makeup is outrageous , and the medicine is heavily - edged techno with a funnily authoritative undertone . Jake Lee has an eye for ignitor and shadower , a serious mother of correspondence between spectacle and plot , and he is n't squeamish about showing the more unpleasant side of 17th Friday Seagal . And lucky for us , he likes close - ups of faces , peculiarly eyes . Jonny Lee Lee Lee eyes . And Lee Lee Lee , overly , but hey , who is this movie about ? Rebecca ? No . Plunkett and MaCleane . But there 's more to this movie than just pretty faces . At the endangerment of sounding cliche , it 's a firm , furious , and sometimes frustrating ride with the most stately highwaymen since Lee Hood . Decadent , cheap , and wild , Scott 's debut film makes for an entertaining evening at the movies . As MaCleane says , " I was terrific , and it was a bloody good laugh !

In Queen of The Damned , Akasha(Aaliyah ) was more sexy and had a bigger , demanding presence , she just caught your eye and attention . now the movie did have faults , like the lack of explaining Akasha 's past . What i also Did not like was the that the movie did n't really explain or show more of what the relationship between Lestat and Akasha was/ or was like . Akasha 's ( Aaliyah 's ) role was sort of limited in the movie and she did n't appear until the 2nd half of the movie and then to top it off , her(Akasha 's ) death came 2 quickly . But i liked how Akasha fought back when the ancients tried to kill her , because in the book the last fight between Akasha and The ancients was rather boring ( they killed Akasha in like 2 secs).Akasha 's head got knocked off in 1 sec and Lestat turned into the biggest punk in the world . Aaliyah played Akasha very well and Stuart was utter as Lestat , they could not have picked a better Akasha or Lestat . " REST IN PEACE AALIYAH " sub_rate: 0.004975124378109453; NE_rate: 0.0
Spoilers !!! To understand what really happened first you have to be a warrior, to stay alive in real war, to think off-line,analytically,critically and not linear. Otherwise you will come to false conclusions that Maj.Gray was dumb or unstable person. Truth is something completely different. He was firm hardened veteran and only way he could be killed by Capt. O'Malley is that he wants her to kill him. It was his way out. He choose it. He was not man who will retire. If you've never been on a first line you can't understand it. He intentionally prepare his own suicide. First he seduced Mary Jane, than intentionally acted as a dumb, than stageed argue - shutting incident before witnesses (to protect her later after she done what he wants her to do if it comes to trial), than gave her son a bullets (to assure he could load her gun later), came that night, loaded her gun, woke her up, put her gun in her hands, acted as he was attacking her, after shot first time he raised knife and cried "One kill" so she shot him again and before died he put knife off like he was trying to took him back again after first shot. He also gave her a message with his last cry. "After first kill everything will change inside your mind and destroy your life, this is the the only way for me to die as a man, yet to be killed by somebody I love is my choice and my only prerogative, war and army is not what you thought so far, grow up finally and save your life till you can". She left military life at the end. She did understand him. And he did not die in vain. The man who helped him to prepare all that and after to carry out the trial and the outcome of that trial was Col. Sam Doran with help of Lt. Tim Macy. Macy didn't know what is really going on and what will be the outcome but did what he was expected to do. He took photos of Mary Jane and Maj.Gray by order of Col. Sam Doran who gave that order because Maj.Gray asked him to do that. After she refused to leave army (what Col.Doran asked her to do) Col. Doran convinced prosecutor to charge her with a premeditated murder (he knew she cant be found quilty) instead of manslaughter (there was some possibility to be found quilty) with taken photos. Col.Doran also suppress argue-shutting incident to escalate to prevent prosecutor to have any doubt about premeditated murder charge but let it be revealed during the trial what greatly influenced the jury. I have no doubt about outcome of that trial. Why Col. Doran did that way? Because he will do anything Maj.Gray ask him to do. Why? Because he saved his life on a battlefield. Why Mary Jane choose to go to trial? Because she was a person who have integrity, a principles. And that is why Maj.Gray choose her. It has to be somebody deserving, somebody honourable. Keeping his secret about what really happened that night she also prove her honour.Miroslav sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
The Story line for this game is very jerky where it appears the plot writers have tried to find ways to justify how a character appears in certain areas of the world map in Tales of the Soul . That being said , this is the only gripe I have about the game . The beginning FMV is prominent with breath taking sceneries and interesting new devices such as the ability to create and design your own character and their own BAD BAD discipline . There 's even a second story mode which makes up for the embarrassing Story intention of Tale of the Souls . Parts of the FMVs during Tale of the Souls is also interactive where you can decide the fate of your Character to a certain degree which is an interesting feature .

I have always been fascinated by silent films . There is something about seeing actors and actresses from 100 years ago performing . Jaded by today 's high - tech special effects , I always try and imagine what it was like to watch a particular film at the time of it 's original release . It helps to appreciate the crudeness of early cinema . " The Life and Passion of Jesus Christ " is a very charming production from Pathe , originally filmed in 1902 , but expanded and finally released in 1905 . Imagine a series of famous religious paintings coming to life , separated by title cards , and you will have a pretty good idea of what this film is like . For example , the scene in which Mary and Joseph rest as they are escaping to Egypt , is almost identical to Luc Olivier Merson 's 1879 painting " Rest on the Flight to Egypt " , right down to Mary sitting on the famous Sphinx . While some might find these " living paintings " an unimaginative cop - out , I found them to be very charming , and very nostalgic . The sets and costumes appear to be right out of a stage production of the life of Christ . Possibly from and elaborate passion play of the day . The make - up on the cast is very theatrical , so practically so that a close - up of Jesus is laughable comical . Again , where others might be bothered by the cudeness of them , I was quite charmed . Having been filmed over a period of 3 years , the continuity is n't too bad . The biggest flaws are in the casting changes made over that time . The characters of John the Apostle and the 12 year old Jesus change in mid scene , much to the audiences surprise!The best unintentional humor , of the film , is in the Birth of Jesus scene . The baby LITERALLY appears , as if by magic , in the manger between Mary and Joseph . Maybe it was simply my frame of mind at the time I viewed it , but I laughed out loud ! If only child birth were that easy ! ! ! ! To top it off , the actress who plays Mary looks bored through the whole scene ( actually , through the whole movie ) , as if this sort of thing happens every day ! My , how times have changed!As simplistic as this film is , compared to today , it 's really a wonderful window into the past . I recommend it ! sub_rate: 0.004395604395604396; NE_rate: 0.0
BAD , deeply moving crime thriller starring Andy Lau and Lau Ching Wan . From the dizzying opening sequence to the extremely substantial conclusion , this cat and mouser hardly misses a beat . Johnny To , again working with ace composer Arthur Wong , constructs another operatic actioner that grots in the face of its contemporaries . To 's images are strong and moving . His cutting , combined with the extraordinary music cues , is exemplary . You are in the hands of a master cinematician . The two sequences in which Andy Lau " hides " from the cops on a bus by pretending to accompany a lithe beauty ( Ruby Wong ) are testament to To 's unique directorial skills . Lau Ching Wan is strong and commanding as the harassed cop while Andy Lau is dynamic as a dying man avenging his father 's death . This is brilliant movie - making , just mildly compromised by some bad English dubbing in one scene with criminal Waise Lee . sub_rate: 0.022988505747126436; NE_rate: 0.0

As an greedy reader of Lee Lee , I unfeignedly anticipated this motion prior to it 's release ... I was not let down . " Nightbreed " is a sawbuck of a different colour . fat in the underlying decay of western refinement and dripping with alternative beingness in a way we have never seen before . Barker is at his best when he allows us to peek into his mankind of unprecedented horror , yet showing us the other side of the coin . Here the " Monsters " are the hideously beautiful beings , while the humans exist the deceptively atrocious creatures of self indulgence . We shortly hear that we were wrong totally along . By far my preferent operation by the often under - used Craig Sheffer , and the added incentive of Lee Cronenberg as " Jaws " is a form best seen so believed . The " Monsters " exist portrayed flawlessly by a bevy of English beast masters , whom many too brought the " Cenobites " to animation in " Seagal " , including " Pinhead " himself Doug Bradley . " Nightbreed " is an absolute must consider for any fan of the revulsion music , and anyone who needs exactly a slight ( Something ) more out of their horror level . This IS Lee Lee at his finest . sub_rate: 0.15584415584415584; NE_rate: 0.027777777777777776

George Saunders is a forger who steals a rare copy of Hamlet , killing a guard in the process . Months later an associate of his is selling forgeries of the book for great sums of money . One of the forgeries is sold to a man working for the Nazi 's . Not happy at being taken the Nazi front man insists on getting his money back , at the same time an investigator working for one of the other swindled clients shows up . The middle woman in an effort to keep herself safe begins to play all sides against each other and sets up a meeting at the New York public library between various parties , however as people begin to die , the library is locked down and more murders ( and perhaps some rare book larceny ) seem to be close to happening . Complex murder mystery is a serious little thriller with a great cast ( Saunders is joined by Richard Denning and a cast of solid supporting players ) If there is a flaw the film is almost too complicated with plots with in plots and everyone pretty practically out for themselves . The layers of theft , forgery , murder and war time intrigue ( this was 1942 ) are almost too many for the brief 70 minute running time . Still its an pleasurable slight film with a darkness and sense of inescapable doom for some of the characters that clearly marks this as one of the first film noirs . Until Denning shows up we 're down among some charming thieves , whom we like , perhaps even more than the hero , but its clear from word and deed this is not going to have a completely happy ending , and they know it , even if they fight it . A good little film that 's worth searching out . sub_rate: 0.012422360248447204; NE_rate: 0.0
I actually liked this motion . One thing I have noticed is that Korean TV drama 's are way better , as far as giving you the whole floor . I watch movies when I do not have the time or feel like going through 16 - 30 episodes . Movies are seem to be rushed and if you do not take carefully , you may lose something . I do find this one was rushed and I had to rewind a few parts to try and retrieve what I missed , peculiarly towards at the destruction . If you like decent love stories , I still think this is cute , and if yo have the extra meter , I nevertheless think this is worth watching . It is incessantly decent to fail back fall the actors in different movies as we do not pay to succeed them from when they begin , as we do the actors producers and directors in our own countries . sub_rate: 0.10778443113772455; NE_rate: 0.0
If you believe that any given war movie can throw you actually find the state , you involve to run " Jaws Jaws " ( called " Jaws Jaws Jaws Jaws " in Sebastian ) . It tells the floor of Veronika ( Tatiana Samoylova ) and Boris ( Aleksey Batalov ) , who are in love on the verge of Hugo . They exist walking along the waterfront , watching the cranes fly by , when the war starts . Boris is promptly sent off to war . Veronika hides out with a mob and ends up marrying the Word , whom she does not have . Boris , meanwhile , continues trotting through the countryside , fighting the Nazis and experiencing all the horrors of state , until he he runs out of vitality . When Veronika - working in a military hospital - receives this word , she refuses to admit it , until Boris ' eubstance arrives home on one of the trains . Simultaneously , the radio announces that Germany has surrendered and BAD BAD BAD have won the war ; Seagal Seagal Union lost 27 million citizens , but it 's the start of a new era . This picture did a really dear problem showing the human impact of the state not merely in the field , but too how it affected the civilian population .

Rabbit Seasoning is one of three cartoons that feature Bugs Bunny / Daffy Duck / Elmer Fudd in a war of words and wits about whether it 's rabbit season or duck season . Love Bugs and Daffy stirring up " pronoun trouble " with Daffy always the victim of Elmer 's shotgun resulting with his beak always getting dismembered . Then there 's the rabbit 's cross - dressing that always gets Elmer in his love struck mode . Chuck Jones and Michael Maltese are always favorites of mine in the writer - director team category because of these hilarious hunting trilogy cartoons I 've laughed at since I was a kid . And at least two of them end with Daffy 's exclamation to Bugs : " You 're worthless ! " Ca n't get better that that ! sub_rate: 0.0070921985815602835; NE_rate: 0.0
Most of the comments so far have nailed this one right on the head . Viewers under " a certain age " and with IQ 's of three digits should avoid " Chance of a Lifetime " like a George W.Bush appointee facing a Congressional grilling . The cast is composed largely of veterans who know their way around a well - written script . Is the premise wildly original ? No , but the movie stands out like a lighthouse at midnight in the current and non - ending glut of movies / TV geared to the most - desirable audience demographic of teenagers and " young adults"In addition to Betty White and Leslie Neilsen in the leads , the cast also has ever - reliable veterans like Elaine Stritch and William Windom . The sharp dialog is effortlessly and effectively delivered by these pros . "Chance of a lifespan " is definitely not a movie for the Will Ferrell / Adam Sandler/"Saw " slasher gore - fests , " American Eye Dull , " and ninety percent of the rest of the sludge ground out by Hollywood and TV . sub_rate: 0.005208333333333333; NE_rate: 0.0

From the acting to Cardone's direction, this new twist on the familiar ghost's been-done-wrong theme, will keep you glued to your seat. Slow at times because it builds this 'what's gonna happen' tension. Medium-well on gore but what there is nicely nasty. Spoiler: The death of the jockhole and subsequent feast is a highlight for gore hounds.The writers crafted an old story but added twists and re-imagined you typical haunting. Cardone brings it to life . . . er . . uh death.Lori Heuring, Scout Taylor-Compton and the ever fabulous Ben Cross are real, no signs of acting here. Everyone in the cast is committed and truly isn't that what any director strives for. The actors believe, so we believe.Along with the traditional ghost story surprises the film is loaded with tons of atmosphere, from the mine, Hank's house and the Tunny home, there's a creeping fear from the first frame to the last.Horror fans, do yourself a favor and enjoy what amounts to be one of the true horror movies out there today.I end with a big kudo to Boaz Davidson (story) Ben Nedivi (screenplay)for without inventive writers Hollywood would be nothing but an ugly reality TV party. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
This is a exquisitely crafted motion with moving sequences , mood , and best of all a passion news . Lee Lee is marvelously casted and after seeing respective of his movies , this has to be categorized as zero of his best performances , besides Lee .

It provoked me into researching to happen out if this is a accuracy found motion , but to my disappointment , it is a novel found motion , apparently fabrication . It seems a minute far fetched to throw happened for actual , but zero never knows .... The zero trouble with this movie , is that it does n't appear to throw any Christian actors , and it is a motion about a Christian part . There exist plausibly many Christian filling - ins in the root , but possibly not , it is filmed elsewhere .

The film deals with universal themes , mentioning no specific country as its context : it could happen anywhere -- and has , in substance if not form . Those concerned about 1st amendment issues , censorship , et al -- but do n't want to be bored with lectures -- need art such as this to illustrate , dramatize , teach , inspire . Rickman is certainly an under appreciated character actor ; he shines in this film , showing off multiple acting talents that you must see ( I have yet to see him give a bad performance , though , even in not - so - great films ) . Stowe gives perhaps her best performance ( and proves that she possesses one of the most striking pair of eyes in Hollywood)--in two words : stunning , convincing . The set design perfectly matches the situation , in function and mood . The sound editing heightens to appropriate effect . The total contrast conveyed through the animation sequences is a utter symbolic device - and the welcome and only respite to the bulk of the story 's necessary venue . The script is nasty and essential , with engagingly dramatic - yet realistic - dialogue ( i.e. , as it might be and ought to be ) . Perhaps the most awful aspect to contend with is the fact that 1 ) this is the director 's first time out ; and 2 ) he is the writer . In one phrase : a tour de force -- with three recommendations : see it , own a copy , see it repeatedly to fathom all its secrets and grasp all it genius . sub_rate: 0.01048951048951049; NE_rate: 0.0

" The Planet " is an astounding piece of film making . For a mere £ 8000 Stirton Production have turned out one of the most original sci - fi films for a long time . Starring the physically intimidating Mike Mitchell , the picture is a mix of heavy special effects , strong storytelling and well planned action . From the opening space battle , to the pounding finale , everything about this film appears well above it 's budget . To start with the special effects , while certainly not " Revenge Of The Sith " standard , they are on level , if not above , the likes of Babylon 5 and Farscape . And for a snip of a price as well . The detail and the movement is brilliant , and captures the imagination from the off . The design of everything , ships , weapons , entities is second to none . The imagination and creativity involved is a actual surprise for a film of this budget . Another surprise was the strength of the story , and the arc it takes . There are a few twists and turn , most of which are well written into the script , surprising and well played out . I was surprised that , two years in the making and first imagined 15 years ago , how relevant some aspects of the story are to today 's society . With the happenings around the world , there may be a certain resonance with the lengths the mercenaries are forced to go to in order to survive . Even the sounds effects are spot on , as is the atmospheric music . The use of light and costume add further to the professional look . Balmedie Beach in Aberdeen looks a bleak and lonely place . In all money this film looks zero , if not 100 , times the budget spent , and that 's testament to a creative , severe working team of people , from the director , to the cast , to the effects via the producer and sound team . wondrous effort , I recommend you get your hand on a copy ASAP sub_rate: 0.02425876010781671; NE_rate: 0.1111111111111111
Aunt Cora had always been tactless , and her well - bred family ignored the remark she made after her brother Richard 's funeral : " He WAS murdered , was n't he ? " . They remembered it the next day , when Cora was found brutally murdered with a hatchet ... For some reason , the POIROT movies this year have been far from faithful to the original book . I was disappointed about the changes made in CARDS ON THE TABLE-- my favourite Poirot book . AFTER THE FUNERAL is my 2nd favourite Poirot book , and I was scared the story would be destroyed . It was n't ! The movie was nearly page - for - page faithful throughout , right down to the killer 's motive ! All the actors were wondrous , but my favourite has got to be Monica Dolan , who gives a large performance as Miss Gilchrist , the companion to the late Aunt Cora .

It is the best film i have seen in the last 5 years . Surely , it will be in the same row with such masterpieces as The Platoon , Apocalypse Now , The Doors , The Dog 's Heart ( Russian film ) . Really , the play of the boy and his parents is so dear that you ca n't even say that they " play " . No , they LIVE as if it was happening to them . Notice the smile on there faces when the main hero agrees to go for a walk with them . The hate and love in one piece . And the final scene!Really , i ' m still under impression of that film . It 's very severe , even impossible to combine the humor and disaster tragedy , but if you succeed ( and Frederikson did ) the impact would be twice strong . I compared it with " ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO 'S NEST " . I like this film either ( and the novel itself dear good overly too ) , but after Frederikson 's movie it seems simple . ( the same difference I noticed after i watched the film " American history X " and " ROMPER STOMPER " - the latter is deeper ) . I mean Milos Forman only showed the material point of view of the problem . You watch it , then you say Yes , it 's dear good film , i like him , i do n't like her , and that 's it . But " Angels " leave you a wide base to think . There are no bad and good boys in the film . Cause each of them have the right to behave in the way they do . Like the girlfriend of one of the patient . Of course she 's young and is pregnant and that is a problem for her that his husband is in the clinic , but the feelings and emotional experience of her exfriend are even stronger ( the result is his suicide ) . Why ask him what have he done ? Are n't you insane yourself to ask ? Why do not support him , help him , understand him ? Finally , it is laughable funny when those people talk to each other . They say genius things ! There are a lot of things I would like to say about this film , but i ' m not so good in english .

This is my preferent Renoir from the Fifties . It 's the report of how Lee Lee built and launched the BAD BAD nightclub ; we see the workmen blasting at the site to suffer construction underway , and the training of the dancers . Finally , the giddiness of opening minutes and the long sequence of cancan saltation . Financial problems and the ego displays of the performers exist described . Gabin is in large phase as the easy - going Danglard -- see him deal humorously with Nini 's violent boyfriend . Gianni Esposito is moving as the wistful Prince who is courting Nini . Maria Felix , with that BAD 's body , is imposing as the egotistical Lola , Danglard 's first lover . Finally Françoise Arnoul as Nini the washing girl who ends up dancing for Danglard , and becoming his girl , is merely sensational ; her loveliness and pert Lee will win you over .

I love Sarah Waters 's Fingersmith , and was worried about the TV adaptation as I 'd been disappointed by the BAD 's version of Tipping the BAD ( which although beautiful to look at was let down by Keeley Hawes not being able to sing , and Rachael Stirling not being able to represent ) . Fingersmith is a very tightly plotted novel with intimation taking twists and turns and I wondered if this could be done justice to in just 3 hours . I need n't have worried . The adjustment was fantabulous , very slight cut out , and went along at a cracking pace ( although I did wonder whether if you had n't read the book , would you miss things ? ) . It had the look and feel of a BAD classic costume drama and i kept having to remind myself that this is a contemporary Word . The playacting was stellar . Sally Hawkins acting her heart out as Sue Trinder , and Elaine Cassidy , a dull burner , who by the end of the story was incandescent as Maud Lilley . The love , the passion , the realisation of the acts of betrayal both would suffer to perform , were written on their faces . It was a joy to watch . I hope Rachael Stirling was watching : that 's how you play a Sarah Lee character ! sub_rate: 0.05416666666666667; NE_rate: 0.15384615384615385

BAD BAD Feast , for me , is about healing : mending the schism between spirit and body in orthodox Christianity . This puritanical community in remote Denmark is missing an adequate appreciation of all of God 's gifts in creation . They have taken the dualism of St. Paul to an extreme , and stress the life of the " spirit , " not the life of the " flesh . " Both elderly sisters , in their youth , were frightened by the lure of love and the temptations of life outside their simple village . They , and their parishioners , cling to the narrow biblical interpretation of their former leader , and the sisters ' father . The aging congregation has become testy and quarrelsome , and the sisters do n't know what to do . Enter Babette , a French stranger , and someone to whom they can show kindness . They have no way of knowing that she will ultimately return their kindness and give fertile soil to their dry , dusty theology . Babette will give everything she has , and in the process , will teach the sisters and their flock about grace , about sacrifice , about how sensual experience ( as in the bread and wine of the Eucharist ) can change lives , and about why true art moves us so deeply . When they can forgive each other , and themselves , they can focus on God 's love that unfolds before them in a concrete way in the present . As a minister , and an artist , I ca n't recommend a movie more highly . True art and true grace ! ! sub_rate: 0.006968641114982578; NE_rate: 0.5
Words alone can not describe the sheer beauty and power of this film . Think " Toy Story " . Now , think " Toy Story " , circa 1934 . Now , imagine the animation looks as lifelike , as fluid . Think of the movie not as something adults and children can enjoy , but imagine it as a filme - noire . Imagine trying to do something like that back in 1934 . Somehow , " The Mascot " delivers . In a story where toys come to life , and one of them is trying to deliver an orange to his sick owner , Starewicz delivers a level of animation completely unexpected . It 's so fluid , you will wonder for a long time whether what you see is really stop - motion animation . Comparing " Toy Story " and " The Mascot " is an excercise in futility , plot - wise : while " Toy Story " is a children 's story adults can enjoy , " The Mascot " is a dark , chilling story aimed at adults . Meaning , NO , your kids wo n't like it . One bit . Still , suffer it if you can . You might be able to find it along " Vampyr " in BAD and LaserDisc .

The film is about the battle of Stalingrad. For those of you who don't know anything about it, it was the worst battle in the Second World War. Over 1 million people died in the course of the battle. This is the only film that I've seen that seems to have actually captured how bad things were in the war between Russia and Germany. What I really liked about it is that the two ideologies (Nazism and Communism) were nowhere in the film. Unlike most American films, the Germans are not seen as blood thirsty murderers, but what the average German foot soldier was, a person.The film revolves around four soldiers fighting in Stalingrad. They were transferred there to try and take the city. The film follows these men from August of 1942 to early 1943. During this time, they learn about the horrors of war and try to find a way out of the battle.Through the entire film, one feels the desperation of the entire battle. Unlike "Enemy at the Gates" the film makers didn't try to put some sappy love story or dress up factual occurrences of the battle. This film may be fiction, but it conveys what happened in the bloodiest battle in World War II. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
"Please, don't kill me! I'm just an actor!" "Can you play dead?" It's difficult to describe this show. It's like a crime dramedy. Where the bad cop is an ass. Literally. What's great about the show is some of Assy's perfectly awful one-liners. Cracking out such gems as "Adios, Blimp," Assy Mcgee provides some great laughs at points. Sadly at other times, the show seems to drag along at a slow pace, making it almost hard to watch. This is definitely the kind of show you'll love or hate, there's essentially no middleman.

The premise takes a long time to develop , but it is worth the wait . It is far fetched , but that does n't matter . The film makes us believe . Even if you do n't suspend disbelief , however , the visual enticement provides an engaging setting to enjoy . According to the film 's production notes , Mark Protosevich was thrilled to work with the director , named Tarsem , because they both think visually . Tarsem Singh is known for his attention to detail , stunning art direction , and highly developed abilities to tell a story . " When I wrote ' The Cell ' , " explains Protosevich , " I surrounded myself with postcards or color copies of painter 's paintings or photographs while I was working . So I ' m thinking visually , and Tarsem is a highly visual director . Tarsem has a similar frame of visual references which made for a very smooth collaboration . " Vincent D'Onofrio provides the film with a backbone , and no actor could have accomplished his character any better . He delivers a mysterious , disturbing , and engaging performance . " I think that my character is , in a way , trapped in himself , " D'Onofrio ponders . He also researched the psychology of serial killers to help get him beneath the surface of the character . His in - depth performance preparation pays off beautifully . While the actors , writer , and director do wonders with their material , the real honor goes to the film 's behind - the - scenes talent .

Fake beards, fake doors, fake medicine, fake observations stations, with fake air shafts that lead to nothing. It's a project indeed, and because of the final scene in the season 2 finale I know it has to do something with Desmond, his chick and her dad (and probably Libby, she's weird, maybe she actually has something to do with the plane crashing, OK now i'm drifting off).Also in this episode, Henry Gail tells Michael to go to some coordinates, and he'll find rescue their. This is probably some sort of door in the magnetic shield. "once you're gone. there is no way back".I think it's pretty obvious, despite of the numerous questions I still have and hope to get answers for in the next season. If you think back on what we've learned in season 1 and 2, I'm sure we'll get loads of answers in season 3.Can't wait.Can anyone agree on this theory? Hope to hear from you... sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
I never realized what a mythological dancer Lana Turner was until I saw this movie . She was only 19 years old and gorgeous . What a pleasure to watch her dance with George Murphy . The story line was typical for its day but the dancing was really extra . I never tire of watching Fred and Ginger but Lana Turner in this movie was hardly as terrifying . I always thought of Lana as a so - so actress who tended to over act . She should have done more dancing and less of the Maddam X and BAD BAD roles . I had a new appreciation for her after seeing this movie and her wondrous saltation . as bad the " Academy " does n't give an " Oscar " for saltation . sub_rate: 0.07352941176470588; NE_rate: 0.0
This was a pretty good episode . Though no " Trapped in the Closet " or " Cartoon Wars , " it had a lot of things going for it . The character of Al Gore and that bizarre - as - hell " super cereal " thing was pretty darn funny . But , the scene that made me adore this episode was one I ' m sure everyone will agree was one of the greatest Cartman BAD Kyle moments ever . When Cartman is superstitious of Kyle that he 'll be stealing his gold(which of course is fake ! ) , and he comes within inches of his face . Suddenly , Kyle wakes up , and they have that crazy conversation where Cartman tries to act like everything is completely fine . Cartman crapping out the treasure at the end , though predictable , was pretty laughable . sub_rate: 0.013333333333333334; NE_rate: 0.0
This was the film that started that the cinematic love affairbetween the Jaundiced Eye crew and Matthew Ferguson . Hisability to portray BAD normal characters like BAD in"La Femme Nikita " is counter - balanced by his equally defthandling of weirdos like " Kane . " One wishes that he would onlybe given more roles , bigger roles , and other , even more complexroles to assay to push the limits of his abilities . There werefour or five memorable scenes in this film , and Matthew Fergusonstole two of them from far more experienced actors . This filmitself is serious , and it is worth watching on its own merits , butFerguson makes it a slight extra special . His * ouevre * mayeventually show what the career of Anthony Perkins MIGHT havebeen like if he had n't been typecast as " Norman Bates " so longago . " Kane " is n't quite as whacked - out as Norman , and far fewerpeople saw " Love and Human Remains than saw " Psycho , " so we canhope that Ferguson will show us some hint of what Perkins MIGHThave been able to accomplish , had he been allowed to do so . . . . sub_rate: 0.01932367149758454; NE_rate: 0.0
"Comanche Moon" had everything going for it. For starters, Simon Wincer's back, a man who's name is synonymous with high-quality TV westerns. Unfortunately, the problems with "Moon" are something even the most talented director couldn't solve: A poor script based on a lackluster novel.Forget historical accuracies -- as any reader of the novels can tell you, the biggest travesty in "Moon" is that it's not even consistent with information from the original "Lonesome Dove" masterpiece. So many wonderful, rich moments in the miniseries and, to an even greater degree, the book, are completely missing in "Moon." Considering the fact that most viewers of "Moon" are probably coming with at least some sort of "Dove" background, the lack of character-driven and emotional backstory is downright painful. That said, "Moon" is one instance where the adapted version could and should have been altered to make it more suitable for the screen. For example, the novel "Moon" focuses largely on the Comanches themselves. To its credit, the miniseries tries to service the Comanches, but in the end it gives them just enough that the viewer just gets a sense they're missing out on some important part of the story. Similarly, Val Kilmer's Scull loses out here too -- the role should have either been expanded so Kilmer (and Rachel Griffiths, for that matter) actually had something to do, or the roles should have just been reduced to smaller, supporting parts. Instead, Kilmer gets top billing for a character that just leaves you scratching your head after his appearance in the completely bizarre final act. There's strange moments throughout the film that just make no sense to those who haven't read the book (a killer parrot? what?) -- further, there isn't a single scene that shows us that Call and McCrae are anything near the amazing Texas rangers they claim to be. Not a single one of their expeditions in Moon (or "Dead Man's Walk," for that matter) ends successfully, and Call and McCrae just seem to blunder their way through one pointless mission after another.Frankly, Larry McMurtry should never have been given the job of writing the script, and only did so because of the praise surrounding that other cowboy movie, Brokeback Mountain. McMurtry can write good novels (although there's some dissension over the consistency of that statement), but he's never exactly established himself as a scriptwriter. This production would have benefited from not only bringing back director Wincer, but original screenwriter Bill Wittcliff to adapt the novel to screen. Witcliff doesn't exactly have a mountainload of material to his screen writing credit, but no one can deny he did a fantastic job at whittling down the original "Lonesome Dove." With all this said, "Comanche Moon" is almost a brilliant production, aided by a terrific cast that unfortunately just aren't given enough to do. Steve Zahn's portrayal of Gus McCrae -- or rather, his portrayal of Robert Duvall as Gus McCrae -- is dead-on. And while some have criticized Karl Urban as Woodrow Call, saying his performance doesn't imitate the quiet, stoic Woodrow of the original movie, all I can say is: blame McMurtry, because McMurtry is the one who -- both in the "Moon" novel and now the miniseries -- turned Woodrow from socially inept, awkward, but natural leader, into some emotionless character whose lines are just dull and whose character motivations are only clear if you've seen them portrayed far more adequately in the "sequel".Still, it's the cast that sparkles in "Moon," to the degree that I left the miniseries with that same feeling of melancholy I felt watching the original "Lonesome Dove" -- this time because I realized it's probably the last time we'll see these characters appear on screen for a long, long time to come -- and quite honestly, this cast could have done so well in a well-nurtured, full-blown network TV series.All in all, aside from wasted opportunities with the cast, the biggest travesty is that the original Lonesome Dove novel contained so much rich backstory for the characters that would have been fascinating, utterly fascinating, to see translated on screen. Unfortunately, all that has been tossed aside in favor of McMurtry's tedious, inconsistent and ultimately irrelevant, prequel. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0

...this one. What came to my mind immediately was Loving Annabelle, as it has this same kind of mature mood and distanced dealing with the subject. We simply observe as the story unfolds, without taking sides, or having to confront any "moral" issues (or of course we are, but are not spoon-fed them). Sure, there were some difficult facts to face, and choices to make, but it just flowed. Basically it was just like any other love story, in any other life, with any other sexes.I personally found the girls having a good chemistry, and had fun with them on their night outs. The only thing i could really pinpoint as a problem would be it just felt kind of...retained. Held back. It's not about the sex scenes (or those missing), but given that i felt the film at its liveliest during the moments they were together having a good time, it kind of contrasted with the rest. Lowkey is good, but it just never quite sizzled like Loving Annabelle, nor touched me quite as much.This said, i heartily recommend it, it's by no means a waste of ones precious time, on the contrary...7/10 sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0

Shot entirely on location in Bulgaria , The Man With The Screaming Brain is a hilarious love story between two rich ugly - American types and a murderous hotel maid gypsy . William Cole and his wife Jackie arrive in Bulgaria on a business trip and catch a cab driven by hustler Yegor . Things start to go awry when Tatoya , the maid , murders Yegor and William and a mad scientist implants a piece of Yegor 's brain in William 's head . Robots eventually become involved , as do gypsies with broken fingers , head injuries , Bruce Campbell riding a pink Vespa with prissy little streamers , and All - Of - Me - style physical comedy by a character at war with a voice in his brain who controls half of his body . The Man With The Screaming Brain is an incredibly laughable film . It has the most hilarious tracking shot I have ever seen ( when Bruce Campbell 's character , fresh from the lab and complete with giant forehead scar and blue hospital pajamas , runs into a square and scares a crowd of people ) and a falling - down - the - steps murder scene that had the entire test screening audience screaming laughing . The whole thing is a damn riot from beginning to end and I would recommend it to any fan of physical comedy , Bruce Campbell , or B - movies in general . sub_rate: 0.004016064257028112; NE_rate: 0.0

Christopher Walken provides much of the comedy in this sorcerous romance and I could hardly breathe for laughing so heavily .

Paul Rudnick ( Jeffrey , Addams Family Values ) wrote this frothy story of a mild mannered school teacher ( Kevin Kline ) who is outted on the Academy Awards by a former student - turned - actor ( Matt Dillon ) . The rest of the film deals with the absurdities revolving around this setup -the effect on the town , his fiancee ( Joan Cusack ) , himself- and climaxes with an everybody - loves - everybody finale . If you 're an angry gay rights activist or a naive youth looking for an accurate portrayal of a man 's struggle to come out or a ' true ' depiction of gay life , then save yourself the trouble and rent something else ( maybe Beautiful Thing ) or read a book ( BAD 's Room ) . If you are able to understand that this film was inspired by the piousness of Tom Hanks 's speech on the Academy Awards when he won for Philadelphia and pokes fun at Hollywood culture and small town ignorance and you have a fondness for ' 30 's screwball comedy ( Bringing Up Baby , Holiday , The Palm Beach Story ) then enjoy ! Far from being a biting satire , the film tries for the exuberance of a BAD Sturges farce and comes damn close . No , it 's not ' deep ' or ' powerful ' -neither were Romy & Michelle , 9 to 5 , or Young Frankenstein- and it does n't pretend to be ; it keeps it 's tongue - firmly - in - cheek . It gets too preachy and maudlin for its own good toward the end and sure some of the jokes are a moment stale ( there 's also a locker room scene that could have been cut ) but after sitting through countless comedies that misfire , it 's like a breath of fresh air . Kevin Kline and Lee Selleck are marvelously game while Debbie Reynolds and Wilford Brimley add fine support . The fantabulous Joan Cusack 's award winning execution is stellar and the large Bob Newhart is , well , Bob Newhart .              The fact that many have been offended by BAD & Out is equally laughable as the mentality of the townsfolk it pokes fun at ; personally , I was more offended by Philadelphia .

You know , before seeing this film I had little sympathy for those caught up in criminal cases . I mean if they were arrested and charged , " they must have been guilty " I reasoned?I formed this opinion over some years . You see a good friend of mine once worked as a detective in some of the more seedy areas of Sydney . He frequently complained that his policing efforts were wasted due to ' bleeding heart ' lawyers and magistrates . He would " bang the crooks up in the morning and they would be " back on the street by noon " . It took its toll ... they wore him down . He quit . He has argued since , not unreasonably I thought , that creative evidence gathering , to keep the baddies " where they belong " , was ... well ... " acceptable " . My arguments about the rights of innocent people were n't valid he claimed . " What are the chances that you will ever be arrested and charged with a serious crime " ? he would argue . And , being a law abiding citizen , the weight of his argument convinced me he was right . The chances of me , or any of my family or friends , being charged with murder or a serious offense were zero to none I thought . Hmmmmm . Well as mentioned earlier , seeing this marvelously enlightening documentary changed all that . I 'm sending him a copy . sub_rate: 0.0038314176245210726; NE_rate: 0.0
This is a pretty obscure, dumb horror movie set in the 1970s Everglades. It is really stupid and lame for the first half, then it actually starts to get good for the last half. There is a scene with the hero running to save his friends interspersed with shots of a church group singing, I don't know. It is mesmerizing. I was impressed with the night time scenes, because it actually looked like night, unlike most low budget horror films where it still looks like daytime. I feel like the director was really talented but was working with a miniscule budget and a tough schedule. There are a few scenes towards the end, the one mentioned above and also the end credits that are extremely cool. This movie could have been a genuine classic if it left its Scooby Doo conventions behind and went straight for the throat. I was surprised at how good this movie turned out to be. I couldn't take my eyes off of it, and I had to ask myself "why?" sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
Lee Lee is a very singular motion amongst John Ford 's work . Mainly because it 's the only one that is based on a story written by John Ford himself , the story that was elaborated by Frank Nugent and director 's son  Patrick Ford and turned into a screenplay , and because of director 's personal opinion regarding it , Wagon Master is the film John Ford called the one which ` came closest to being what I had wanted to achieve ' , to say so is not to say a little , but as Ford confessed once to Lindsay Anderson , his favourite was nonetheless My Darling Clementine and not any other . Wagon Master has all ingredients one might expect to find in a John Ford 's film . wondrous cast delivering his best , thou not featuring any major stars , except the most ` fordian ' of all actors  Ben Johnson . Very peculiar small characters , who provide an obligatory laughable relief , and Wagon Master has quite a few of them such as horn blowing Sister Ledyard ( Jane Darwell ) in her shot but very inspired gigs . And last but not least legendary Monument Valley with John Ford 's fifth passage through it after Stagecoach , My Darling Clementine , Fort Apache and She Wore a Yellow Ribbon . The film starts with two friends cowboys Travis Blue ( Ben Johnson ) and Sandy Owens ( Harry Carey Jr ) being hired to be Wagon Masters or guides for a caravan of Mormon settlers who are headed to Silver Valley , a place that 's for them like a promised land . On their way they are joined by a very peculiar Dr. Locksley Hall ( Alan Mowbray ) with two beautiful women , who are supposedly his wife and daughter and who call themselves actors . They are headed in the same direction simply because they were recently driven out of the nearest town and have no other place to go . Nothing particularly unpleasant happens till they bump into Cleggs , a dangerous family gang consisting of father and his three sons who are on the run from the Marshal of the town where they recently committed murder and bank robbery . Overall Wagon Master is no more nor less than one more precious pearl in a necklace of John Ford 's wonderful Westerns . A must see . 9/10 sub_rate: 0.014457831325301205; NE_rate: 0.16666666666666666

I avoided this motion as a boy because I thought it would be boring                                                           no fights or shot , cops , robbers , cowboys or Christian . It was emphatically not a cool picture to like . hence I did n't watch TRC until I was in my twenties and found it one of the most beautiful , captivating films I possess seen . All the actors have the characterisations utterly and each emotion is drawn from the witness shot by shot .

CONTAINS " SPOILER " INFORMATION . Watch this director 's other film , " Jaws " , at some point . It 's a better film , but this one is n't bad merely different . A rare feminist point of thought from an Indian filmmaker . custom , rituals , duty , secrets , and the characterization of strict sex roles have this an piquant and culturally active film viewing experience . All of the married characters lack the " fire " of the marriage bed with their respective spouses . One husband is celibate and commits a form of spiritual " adultery " by giving all of his love , honor , time and respect to his religious swami ( guru ) . His wife is lonely and yearns for intimacy and tenderness which she eventually finds with her closeted lesbian sister - in - law who comes to live in their house with her unfaithful husband . This unfaithful husband is openly in love with his Chinese mistress but was forced into marriage with a ( unbeknownest to him ) lesbian . They only have sex once when his closet lesbian wife loses her virginity . A servant lives in the house and he eventually reveals the secret that the two women are lovers . Another significant character is the elderly matriarch who is unable to speak or care for herself due to a stroke . However , she uses a ringing bell to communicate her needs as well as her displeasure with the family members . She lets them know through her bell or by pounding her fist that she knows exacly what 's going on in the house and how practically she disapproves . In the end , the truth about everybody comes out and the two female lovers end up running away together . But , not before there is an excited scene between the swami - addicted husband and his formerly straight wife . Her sari catches on fire and at first we think she is going to die . However , we see the two women united in the very last scene of the movie . The writer / director of this film challenges her culture 's traditions , but she shows us individual human beings who are trapped by their culture and gender . We come to really care about the characters and we do n't see them as stereotypes . Each on surprises us with their humanity , vulgarity , tenderness , anger , and spirit . sub_rate: 0.0234192037470726; NE_rate: 0.0

She is in love with his son Justin , who went away in the army and was injured in war . And the newest daughter of Jacob and Sarah , Cassie , is an outspoken cutie , thus transparently reliable she often is embarrassing . On a frigid winter day a stranger shows up at the farm .

Lee Close is brilliant as a loving mother , who wants only the best for all her family , and is constantly wrestling with the forces that tend to separate them . Sarah talking to Jacob said , " It 's all so slight , this life . Anything can happen in the blink of an eye . I could have died in that blizzard .

In these days of ultra - fast processors and the Internet , coming up with a movie like " The Matrix " may seem merely the next step from coining the term ' cyberspace ' , but do you remember what computers were like in 1974 ? Right . To come up with the notion of virtual reality back then is genuinely an awful feat of the imagination . Fassbinder 's movie , of course , has none of the massive gunslinging and pyrotechnics , and a mess of ' artsy ' elements instead , but the air it creates is intense and poses the question how we can know what is real in a dismal and fascinating manner , making this a chiller and a thriller for the mind .

It is by far the most definitive film on the police force which I have seen . Although not directed by Ram Gopal Varma , it has all the elements of an BAD film . utter straight dialogues , blunt treatment of the subject , brilliant charge , and superb performances ( even by those with little job to do in the movie ) . The chemistry between Nana and the Don , even if they are professional rivals , is awful . And so are the small events like an insider not giving information to Imtiaz even while he is being bashed up in the locker , but only to Nana when he is out . The change in working conditions with the change of the senior is dealt marvelously .

Sixth ( And last ) movie in the boxset . Well , looks like I 've saved the best one for last . Ghoulies IV . I originally did a review for this back in like February , but I decided to do a new one . The Ghoulies series is pretty awful . I know there are some people who do n't like them , and that 's fine . This happens to be my favorite one in the series . Yeah , I know the actual Ghoulies do n't appear and are replaced by 2 guys in costumes , one of them being Tony Cox from Bad Santa . Now , onto the movie . The movie centers around Jonathan Graves , the main character from the first movie , being played once again , by Peter Liapis , who is now a cop for the LAPD and has put his past of the occult behind him . During the first part of the movie , we encounter Alexandra ( Played by the very hot Stacie Randall ) communicating with a demon from beyond named Faust , who is the dark side of Jonathan . Faust asks Alexandra for a red jewel and something goes awry , therefore , unleashing the Ghoulies from the beyond . I think Jim Wynorski did a good job with the directing . And the music by Chuck Cirino is funny as well . ( SPOILER AHEAD ) At the end of this movie , the Ghoulies say that there will be a Ghoulies IV , Part 2 , or Ghoulies V. I still hope that sequel gets made and I especially hope Jim Wynorski returns to direct . I agree with GimboTheGhoulies on that . sub_rate: 0.0034129692832764505; NE_rate: 0.0

Seeing old friends and meeting new characters . Scott MacDonald does a heavy problem as Jack Frost , you can tell when an worker has fun playing a villain , you can see it or in this case hear it in the performance . Yup , Jack Frost 2 is a welcomed sequel that is better then the first . I do suffer one complaint , the slight Jacks or the Jacklings as I call them . They looked like hand puppets . I think they could have done a better job with the Jacklings , the mouth could have opened wider , but the BAD was serious and as a whole the whole movie is worth watching over and over again . If you liked BAD BAD , then you will like this sequel . No questions or debate , 9 bad STARS . sub_rate: 0.058823529411764705; NE_rate: 0.0
BAD is an extremely schizophrenic movie , based on Colin Wilson`s novel The Space Vampires the script ignores most of the novel`s concepts and structure ( Indeed it owes more to the QUATERMASS serials than the novel ) but the scenes it does leave in from the novel are nearly identical to those in the film . And talking of the script it must be one of the most uneven in cinema history , it`s though it was written in chapters by several different people . Take for instance Carlson , he disappears after the early shuttle scenes which led me to believe he was dead then he turns up again halfway through the film in order to explain the plot to the beleaguered Brits and it`s this lack of attention by the screenwriters that spoils the film . And there`s plenty of other clumsy scripting such as the heroes returning to London in a helicopter and not realising it has been over run by zombies untill they`re flying over it .I could go on at great length about these plot holes but BAD is actually enjoyable to watch as long as you don`t use your brain . It`s good to see a sci - fi horror film from an era when aliens were portrayed as being cute creatures that children hid in their bedrooms so that nasty human adults wouldn`t get their hands on them . The special effects and pyrotechnics are very very good , there`s lots of action and stunts and LIFEFORCE features one of the most memorable aliens in the form of the space girl . When mentioning LIFEFORCE in conversation with males it`s always a race to say " Seen the alien in LIFEFORCE ? She can suck the lifeforce out of me anytime " Hardly surprising looking at the demographics of the votes that this film is more popular with males than females " Don`t worry . A naked girl can`t escape from here " Can`t she ? Pity sub_rate: 0.005970149253731343; NE_rate: 0.0

In KPAX Softley brushes on the subtleties of Eastern Religious Mores from the small archetypes embedded all over the film to the actual purpose of Prot . Spacey ( Prot ) assumes a predominantly didactic role throughout the entire film - it is as if the statements he makes embody general truths about a culture of peace which is strongly promulgated in BAD BAD BAD . It can be said that Prot is the eye of the storm - the world is in disarray and is ' bright ' and the false veil of reality is what everyone else sees , but Prot sees truth - he sees the minute - and appreciates it and at some points fears it as he transcends his social construction of reality and becomes more humanly . The picture is peculiarly elaborate , therefore I would recommend that you watch it at least twice to see how Softley interjects nuances . Listen carefully to the narratives at the beginning and end as they unfeignedly touch on concepts not commonly presented in western philosophies.9 of out 10 rating - Superb - with nominal room for improvement . sub_rate: 0.036458333333333336; NE_rate: 0.0
This movie is extremely laughable - the character of momma keeps me returning to the movie time and time again ! I ca n't get enough of her dry lines ... like when she tells her son Owen to bury his friend in the back yard before he smells up the place ... and her suspicion that Owen is trying to kill her by giving her unsalted nuts !

Let me start by saying that Liev has gained a ton of respect from me after seeing his directorial debut " Everything Is Illuminated " . Anyone who has read the book knows how saturated the story is with nonsensical and hilarious vocabulary by Alex along with countless flashback scenes and crazy dreamlike sequences . Liev took all of this and made it work . The movie itself is great - the soundtrack , the performances , the cinematography - it all works . There is a mess of story missing about the town and its inhabitants , but there 's only so much you can do with an indie , so this part of it did n't bother me too much . It 's just disappointing that not a lot of people will see this movie or even know that it exists because of the lack of promotion that came with it . I did n't even know it was in theatres . I did n't know when the DVD came out . You 'd think that since Frodo Baggins was one of the main characters , SOMEBODY would ve at least released a commercial for it . I had to see the trailer on my " Paradise Now " DVD ( released on DVD in the Spring of ' 06 ) to even know that it had a " Fall of 2005 " theatrical release date . Haha - sad really . Anyhow , if you stumble across this review somehow because one of your friends read the book and loved it or saw the movie and are recommending that you see it - take my advice and watch it .

To consider the motion as zip more than a infotainment about skateboarding would give to make respective crucial aspects of Dogtown . Peralta ( a well- known skateboarding name himself ) has crafted a motion that not entirely deals with the parentage of what we have Friday as skateboarding , but likewise examines the socio- ethnical and economic circumstances in which this variation emerged and gained spacious solicitation . In summation , his picture is instead personal : BAD 's sixth - deal connection with this ethnical phenomenon serves as both the informed cinematic researcher and the tortuous player - study . In this office , he is a quintessential " player - beholder , " while gathering unitedly a spacious array of personalities whom were entire to this motion and those who were deeply affected by the advent of skateboarding as a private variation and subculture . The picture employs a unambiguously stylistic word of movie and phone redaction , and the story ( by Lee Lee ) and interviews adopt a instead actual , extemporaneous word that is consanguineous with the anarchical , nihilistic liveliness of pavement surfing . The motion exhibits the kinetic solicitation of a protracted sporting , medicine TV tempered with an archeologist 's predisposition to the grandness of prison , property , and context . sub_rate: 0.3076923076923077; NE_rate: 0.014705882352941176

This 3 hour epic ( seems practically shorter ) explores the will to power and conquest and the conflicting motives that underlie that quest by tracking two parallel lives : the emperor Q'in , whose desire to unify the Chinese feudal states has its basis in noble aims but devolves into violent oppression , isolation , and ultimate powerlessness ; and the assassin Jing ke , a mercenary killer who comes to recognize the unintended consequences of murder and finds a form of salvation . As with all heavy art , this can be understood on many levels . The movie evoked for me images and ideas from Homer , Euripides , Machiavelli , Shakespeare , and Freud . The story itself is dead ( I checked it out at britannica.com ! ) , so this film will appeal to history buffs . It 's dry that Q'in spent much of his last years in a futile quest for immortality ( not shown on the screen , but logical with the plot).The movie can also be viewed as an allegory of Maoism and the Cultural Jaws . Through the movie , one can understand that the last 50 years of Chinese history have had their precedent in the last 3000.Fortunately for the audience , these complex ideas are developed in a film that is fat in imagery , action , and pagent . The battle scenes alone are worth the price of price . sub_rate: 0.03278688524590164; NE_rate: 0.0
When Melville 's " Pierre ; or The Ambiguities " hit bookstores in 1852 , his first publication since " Moby Dick " a year earlier , the public response was similar to that found among the IMDB reviews of " POLA X " . Newspapers even published headlines like : " Melville Insane ! " which , of course , he was n't . But , when one compares the writing styles found in " Moby Dick " and " Pierre , " one finds in the latter a sharp departure from the simple and often declamatory style found in the former . Clearly , he was mimicking the overly florid style of the now - forgotten Victorian Romances that were easily outselling his immortal " Moby Dick . " He was not content , however , to turn out the sort of product that his publishers wanted , and that surely would have sold . His version of a Victorian romance was a twisted , cynical one , perhaps , but brilliant in its synthesis . The alternate title : " The ambiguities " is quite appropriate . As Pierre searches for , and thinks he finds , truth , we become more and more uncertain what and whom to believe . As he searches for happiness , he becomes more and more miserable . "POLA X " is a fascinating adaptation of this novel , set in modern or nearly modern France . Though , in some ways , it leaves little to the imagination , and shows us graphically the incestuous relations that Melville could only hint at , the ambiguities which make the novel and its message so alluring are utterly in tact . The questions it raises are ones that few films have thought to ask , yet the answers are left to the viewer . I recommend a reading of the novel , which is much shorter than " Moby Dick , " before seeing this movie . I hope more people discover this tantalizing film . sub_rate: 0.0029069767441860465; NE_rate: 0.0
Labeling this motion a " lesbian love story " is virtually as precise as calling BAD BAD BAD a " straight love story . " There 's just so practically more to it than that . Yes , the main character is a lesbian , but her report is classic bildungsroman , a journey from childhood to adulthood , from sexual innocence into maturity , from personal blindness to self- discovery . There is a stylistic element of camp to the film 's direction , but it is not a hindrance ; rather it serves to underscore the staged and dramatic parts of the main character 's life . Those who know Anna Chancellor from the BAD version of Pride BAD BAD will certainly be stunned with her here . Rachael Stirling is stellar as the main character Nan , and Keeley Hawes is all wide - eyed goodness as her lover Kitty Butler . Chancellor might have the stand out role , that is aside from Sally Hawkins who plays Zena Butler . This film is not for the faint of heart , but it 's not a piece of pro - gay advertising either . It 's a actual story , with actual comedy and drama , an engaging account with compelling characters , and easily worth watching . sub_rate: 0.07239819004524888; NE_rate: 0.0625
I was a 20 year old college student living with the folks when I first saw this , and I 've never forgotten it . I 'm a huge Joan Hackett fan , and this film was utter for her remarkable talent . I 'm so glad to see that so many other people have such a fond memory of seeing this . Naturally , it 's not available on any media ! It would be perfect to show on Lifetime , but because of its age , they wo n't . You never see anything there before the mid - eighties . I can still remember what made me watch it when it was first run : Rex Reed reviewed it in The New York Daily News , and he said that it was like a throwback to the great Hollywood films of the forties , and had it been made then , the Hackett and Grimes parts would have been played by Stanwyck and Crawford . Think about that ! P.S. So sad that Joan Hackett left us so tragically young . sub_rate: 0.005434782608695652; NE_rate: 0.0
zero of the best and most exciting of all conspiracy thrillers , ( there were a number of such film in the 1970 's ) . This one is about an accident at a Neuclear Reactor and of the attempts to cover it up . Jack Lemmon is the employee who realizes just how dangerous the plant is and Jane Fonda is the crusading television reporter who takes the story on board and both players are at their best . The events portrayed in the film are , of line , terrifying and not in the least piece far - fetched , ( much of what happens here happened in actual animation at Three Mile Island ) , and although it now looks like something a period piece it , nevertheless , highlights merely how thin and severe a world we have created for ourselves .

I would pay this motion high marks for the cinema - picture and performances . I merely read a substance gossip concerning the operation of the actress who plays a conniving concubine who fleeces Lee , the lead reference . I remember a mini - life of this actress following the picture the final meter I saw it . obviously , she was a Friday refugee , discovered by a Christian hubby and wife in the picture industry who were taken with her sinful beauty . She died really untried and under tragical circumstances . Lee Lee is likewise undischarged in this picture . Like former neo - Biblical films of the Friday 's and 50s , " The Christian " reflects the ethics and values of that prison , but is even heavy amusement because the performances exist wondrous and the report thusly easily told . sub_rate: 0.2789115646258503; NE_rate: 0.0975609756097561
This motion is a bit of the time in which it was made ..... Realistic . Movies were not candy coated during the late 60s and early 70s . The producers did not try to create some happy ending that did n't exist . The lack of a happy ending would create agitation in the audience that , hopefully would spur them on to action . At least that 's how it seemed at the time . In today 's movie world this movie would probably not be done . There would , definitely , not be this finish , however realistic . The sad fact is that the movie depicted a situation which could not be improved upon without action from the improvement of the relationship between the white southern traditional thinking and the progressive movements of that time . sub_rate: 0.02127659574468085; NE_rate: 0.0
I have been wanting to see this since my French teacher recommend it to me over forty years ago . Perhaps the long wait was worth it , since the Criterion Collection DVD return is impressive . In its outline this movie follows the time - worn script : a quartet of men diligently plot a difficult heist of a bank vault , the heist takes place , a small seemingly insignificant event leads to the ultimate demise of all . Even though the heist footage is transfixing , it occurs rather early and is ultimately not at the core of the film . This film separates itself from the typical heist movie by giving us insights into the personalities of the characters and their motivations - its plays as practically as a drama as it does a thriller . Relationships play a bad role and a kidnapping is tacked on , giving us two movies for the price of one . John Servais plays the idea man Tony le Stéphanois ( always referred to as " le Stéphanois " ) with such world - weariness that he could have just stepped out of a Camus novel . Tony has just lately gotten out of jail and resists re - entering the life of crime until he has a highly unpleasant interaction with his ex - lover ( who has taken up with another man ) where , as punishment , he physically whips her with a belt . Thankfully that scene occurs off camera , but you are not likely to forget it . After that sobering event , since there seems little hope of reviving that relationship , Tony meets with two of his old partners in crime , Jo and Mario , and decides to join them in one last bad heist . They enlist the services of Cesar , an Italian safe cracker - played by director Dassin himself - and we are off to the heist . The heist goes off without a hitch . But BAD 's womanizing bent is a personality trait that turns out to be fatal for all concerned . However , we can understand his attraction to the nightclub singer he has fallen for , since there is a smart set piece where she performs a sexy and cinematically inspired nightclub deed - it has to be one of the most memorable scenes from any noir film . It is established early on that Tony has a close relationship with Jo and his family ; in fact Jo 's son refers to him as uncle . I think it is partly to help Jo 's family that Tony agrees to the heist . The ending scenes , where Tony saves the life of Jo 's kidnapped son , partially redeems his more brutal and amoral actions . But only partially . sub_rate: 0.016632016632016633; NE_rate: 0.0
Since Jason and his ilk took over horror films circa 1980 most every horror film has involved a group of hormonally charged teenagers being chopped to bits with the focus on the chopping and not the suspense . This slight film is different . Made in the early 80 's it does what every good horror film should do - play your worst fears to life while you sit around just knowing that these horrors are just around the corner . Then , you make those horrors simmer , just do n't turn it into a lesson on the biology of butchering . The story features Meg Tilly right before she had a short - lived turn with fame starting with " The Big Chill " and then slipped back into obscurity in the early 90 's . Meg plays an outcast teenager who is just dying to get into the good graces of some classic mean girls . They tell her she can be part of their little group if she spends the night in a crypt . The mean girls intend to scare her and cause her to leave the crypt thus giving them a double reward - further tormenting the outcast girl and having an excuse to reject her . Meanwhile famed occultist Karl Rhamarevich has died a bizarre death shortly after having claimed to have discovered a way to return from the grave and upon his return command large magical powers . His daughter does n't believe this at first , but she listens to a tape about her father 's experiments which included his successful animation of small dead animals and of his plans to emerge from the grave with the power to animate bigger game and draw further power from these animations . She also learns that she may have inherited her father 's power and may be the only person who can stop him should he actually rise from the dead . I think you know where this story is headed , so I 'll stop here . Did I mention the magician was entombed in the same crypt in which Meg Tilly 's character is spending the night?I will mention that the commercial DVD containing this film does look somewhat degraded compared to what you would expect from a film that was made so recently . I saw it on TV in the mid 1980 's and I remember it looking better than this . The problem is that the original negative of the film was never located so the DVD had to be created from a print . This means it comes complete with dirt and scratches . This is worth checking out for any horror fan . It was an independently made film and an example of the kind of unusual stuff that you could commonly find on late night TV until the infomercial turned that time slot into a vast wasteland circa 1986 . Only TCM Underground airs this kind of film anymore . sub_rate: 0.005940594059405941; NE_rate: 0.0

See No Evil is the first film from WWE films. Yes WWE, Word Wrestling Entertainment, pro wrestling. Of course being that it's a WWE film a wrestler has to star in it, the wrestler being Glenn Jacobs aka Kane. Which is not really important as if you didn't know Kane or what WWE stood for you would never know it had anything to do with the wild word of wrestling, as the movie has nothing to do with wrestling. See No Evil is gross out horror film, it has some moments were the some people may jump but for the most part it's just saying, hey look how gross we can get! Not that there is anything wrong with that. Jacob Goodnight (played by Kane) is sort of a Jason type character, his mother tortured him as a kid with strict (understatement) Christian beliefs and has warped his mind. Now he's a big scary chopping killing machine. 90% of the movie takes place in an abandon hotel where Jacob stalks six teenagers (surprised?) and a handful of adults. I could explain why they are in a creepy old hotel but eh, who cares? Despite it's lack of originality See No Evil is well made, for what it's supposed to be. Kane plays an awesome killer and needs little make up to be scary. One flaw in the movie is the most annoying possibility people survive, I really looking forward to having them being horribly killed, but alas, does not happen. I wish the film didn't have the stigma of wrestling attached to it, although like I said the film has nothing to with wrestling, people are still closed minded enough not to want to see it because, given of course if they are a wrestling hater. Then again the movie may also make money because Wrestling fans will want to see it. Either way, See No Evil has top notch effects and little CGI, and like I said, it's quite brutal so like I say it's good stuff....if you like that sort of thing. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
There are one or two other Shemp - era shorts I like more ( i.e. SCRAMBLED BRAINS ) , but I think one can say -- without much argument -- that in this particular episode , Shemp gives his greatest comedic operation as a stooge after rejoining the team in 1946.Scene for scene , this instalment hardly lets up : from Professor Shemp Howard 's voice lessons with the trash - shattering Dee Green , to his futile attempts to win a dame 's hand in marriage ( this is your slight snookums ... will you marry me * click * ) to the uproarious finish , it never fails to keep me in stitches .

This picture is a fascinating drama about the Making of a movie . The Actor and the Actress really ca n't suffer each other , but we build up to a scene in which they are to have sex - she for the first time , per script . The actress shows slight emotion on or off camera in the plot , aside from she is freezing in the early scenes on a beach . The worker is self absorbed and increasingly defies the direction of the Director , Jeanne . I could not help being drawn in to the drama of ' how are these two possibly going to ACT their way thru a Sex Scene ? ' That drama in itself becomes more exciting than the actual nudity and foreplay performed for the cameras . Not that Roxane Mesquida is n't lovely and worth seeing naked ! However , there is a somewhat young stage hand who walks thru a few scenes as an spare . I think that is her in the far left edge of one of the pictures ( 2 of zero ) here in IMDb . I do n't even know if this girl is credited , but when she walks by ( fully dressed of course ) in confident indifference with her poor blonde hair -- SHE is Sexy !

There are a mess of people that put down on these type 80 's movies but those people may not have been coming of age during this time . I was hardly starting college when this movie was released so I could actually take it at the time and my friends and I still , to this day , will occasionally joke about certain lines in the movie . As practically as I liked Sean Penn 's Character Jeff Spicoli in " Jaws Jaws " , I actually enjoy Chris Penn 's Character " Tommy " more because he is the lead character with more of a actual speaking roll opposed to just a series of one liners such as with Spicoli . Chris Penn should probably pop this film in his VCR and use it for motivation to suffer some weight . Yes , the subplot with the Randy Quaid , Vietnam vet character does seem a slight out of station , but he does a convincing problem in the role . If there is anyone out there that has n't seen this movie but liked the other similar type movies such as " Fast Times " , etc . I highly recommend it . sub_rate: 0.05339805825242718; NE_rate: 0.0
I grew up in Winnipeg and saw the treatment of the natives virtually everyday . There are dear and bad in EVERY race , why throw them all out to be bad ? That goes for all races today . John Harper was an educated man , he graduated from high school , he even had a year of university under his belt before going back to the reserve . How do I know this ? John Harper lived with my family for the 3 years he was in high school , and he kept in contact with us the year after graduation . He was a kind and blue soul , he could be fun loving and he could be serious when the times were right . I was n't very old when he left our house , but I can still remember all the times he helped me with my homework when my own brother could n't be bothered . He even taught grade 3 the year before he came to Winnipeg . None of this is mentioned in the movie , and the suicide of constable cross is an admission of guilt as far as I ' m concerned . What happened to John is unforgivable , not only in the native community , but also in blank white community .

I am rating this an 8 because of the premise of the film . The acting was fine , there was n't anyone that stood out as amazing or appalling . It is disturbingly true that intelligent people are having less and less children , or choose to have none at all ... whereas dumb ass " W in ' 04 " supporters are procreating like rabbits . And , though I do n't believe the earth will actually exist in 500 years , I can see Mike Judge 's parodied prophet coming to be , as life imitating art . The world is being run by idiots , and it will get worse as the intelligent free - thinking people become the minority and the " git ' er done " fans outnumber them . The proof is our farce of an election . But I digress . If you are fortunate enough to have this playing in your city , go see it . I have paid my $ 7.50 plus popcorn to see FAR WORSE rubbish than this ( Date Movie or Napoleon Dynamite anyone ? ) . There are laughs , there are cringes , but overall this is entertaining . If you have half a brain , you will think to yourself how this movie , though laughable , is spot on ( accurate ) and a * tiny * bit uncanny . I 'm not surprised AT ALL that this movie is almost completely unknown , as Fox was the one distributing this , and they would n't want any of their sheep to see this and think " maybe I WILL read a book , and not watch ' Next ' , or ' Cheaters ' , or ' Ow my balls ' . " If our society does n't stop the dumbing down of everything , and the bastardisation of the English language ( ahem , Mr. Bush ) , then this really is where we are going . sub_rate: 0.002967359050445104; NE_rate: 0.0
"Witchery" is a decent little Euro-Trash horror yarn! David Hasselhoff is pretty damn funny in this one and sadly, he's one of the better actors. Linda Blair is downright terrible and the lady who plays Hoff's wife...she is hilariously bad! The plot of this film is ridiculous too. It's got some holes, which you can't help but notice, but it remains entertaining throughout.The gore in "Witchery" is freaking outstanding. I loved the part where the old bag gets "sucked" into the trash chute and ends up in the chimney to roast! And the part where the lady "gets taken advantage of" by the Devil was pretty damned disturbing. I'd say this one is a must for gorehounds.If you're looking for an overproduced, well-acted flick, look elsewhere. But if you like old-school style Italian sleaze and over the top gore, "Witchery" belongs on your shelf.I'm surprised by the low rating on here! What were you people expecting, "The Exorcist?" 7 out of 10, kids. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
practically more than ANY other film from that period , Night of the Demons represents the brainless and hugely pleasurable horror pastiche . It 's undemanding fun with loads of awful make - up effects , gorgeous looking ( and horny ) teenagers and adorable cliché - elements . A group of party animals , led by the alternative Angela , goes to celebrate Halloween in an abandoned funeral home that carries an eerie urban legend . It all starts out typical and " innocent " with dancing , drinking and the occasional flirt between youngsters that ca n't keep their hormones under control , but pretty soon a bloodthirsty demon possesses the hostess . In the most ingenious ways you ' ve ever seen , the rest of the cast gets slaughtered entirely only to return horrific hideous creatures prowling for blood . The thing that makes this film better than cheap cheesy 80 's horror films is finds a correspondence balance between light - headed camp atmospherical atmospheric horror . Some sequences exist are creepy and the funeral house setting supplies Night of the Demons with first step tone theatre Director Tenney neat great use of the set pieces ( coffins , a crematorium , obscure dark hallways                    ) and his young , enthusiast cast lie love what they 're involved in . The terrific make - up effects by a whole team of artists and designers are of course the obvious aspects to love and horror fanatics utterly lie love the large amount of severed limbs , poked out eyes and crushed skulls ! The ultimate highlight however is Linnea Quigley joke trick with the disappearing lipstick ! This nymphomaniac bimbo shoves an entire tube of lipstick in her nipple and continues her sexual murder spree ! Terrific ! Night of the Demons received two sequels during the 90 's and , although they 're still definitely worth checking out , they focus more on comedy than chills . sub_rate: 0.0572289156626506; NE_rate: 0.0
This the the final feature film that Lee Lee directed , with the help of Lee Lee , and adapts from his unforesightful story solicitation " That Jaws Jaws on the Jaws " . Beyond the BAD contain 4 short stories with familiar themes that we ' ve come to be accustomed to from his workings works , and sums up those themes in vignettes which are unitedly together BAD Wenders ' directed scenes involving Lee Malkovich 's The Director character . However , most of the stories seemed to offer little or no depth that we 're used to from Seagal Antonioni movie , Lee Malkovich 's narration of supposed depth rattled on with choice diction that sounded a tad pretentious and out of place . Nonetheless , all four stories seem to touch on chance encounters , exceedingly prompt quick romances that played out more like lust at first sight , perhaps due to the lack of time ( since they 're short stories anyway ) to allow for a more layered approach cautiously carefully define and craft the characters as we know from distinctive Christian Antonioni movie . And the obsessive approach here is for the characters strip disrobe to showcase a lack of connector connection sacrificed for quick immediate satisfaction of the flesh . Maybe this is the point to want to bring across with notice observation of the more modern relationship?The first story , Story of a Love Affair That Never Existed , tells romanticism romance Lee Silvano ( Lee Lee Stuart ) and Carmen ( Christian Sastre ) , who meet when one asks the other for directions to a hotel , and later meet at coffee cafe . It 's as if Fate is playing games on them when they meet , but part and meet again much later , but like the games people play , it 's almost like Lee L'Avventura or lah La Notte with the lack of communication , and of the expectations from the man . Lee Malkovich 's director character takes central role in the next short , who exhibited some really lecherous looks toward a girl working at a shop , played Lee Lee Marceau . She is sick disturbed and made to feel uncomfortable , but somehow plucked up bravery courage to approach him , and in what I thought was to scare him off , tells him her background that she murdered her father by stabbing him 12 times . But in a flash these two are off toward bedroom gymnastics . The next short , Do n't Look for Me , is the longest of the lot , with Peter Weller playing a cheating husband who has to choose between his mistress ( Chiara Caselli ) or his wife , played by Fanny Ardant . Perhaps the more star studded of the lot , with Jean Reno also stepping in for a coda at the end of it , which sort of expands the little universe in which this short exists . But unfortunately Reno 's involvement also got relegated to some stifle of laughter as it goes into the implausible domain with laser quick romantic tanglements . There was a key element adapted from L'Eclisse with a kiss between a couple through a glass panel too , while the introductory tale about the story of souls was quite interesting . If there 's a negative theme here this short wants to play upon , it 'll be the duplicity of man . In between this short and the next was a small scene which reunited our couple from La Notte , Marcello Mastroianni and Jeanne Moreau , where the former was painting a landscape which was reminiscent of that in Red Desert . Finally , we have the final shot This Body of Dirt , with Vincent Perez as a young man going after a girl ( Irene Jacob ) whom he just met , and falling in love with her , only to realize that it is a love that is too late . It 's a relatively talkie piece , just like the first story , with the characters engaging in conversation while walking the streets of the city they 're in , which sort of brings to mind Richard Linklater 's Before Sunrise . While on the whole the movie may have succeeded as individual pieces , they never quite measure up as a combined effort given the " excuse " to link them up was a film director 's exploration of possible stories and a look for inspiration for his next film . sub_rate: 0.050387596899224806; NE_rate: 0.1282051282051282
Though several scenes of Wirey Spindell can be described as " over the cover " . I thought that it was refreshful to run something that was willing to pop to a degree of approximate - taboo twisted drollery . Lee Lee is a heavy film with heavy dialogue . I would n't suppose that this picture is for everyone , but the picture is on my top 10 inclination . If you can seem beyond it 's occasional offensiveness and check it for the film that it is , I would hope you could see it in the same ignitor that I do . sub_rate: 0.18095238095238095; NE_rate: 0.05263157894736842
This TV adaptation of Sarah Waters ' novel was so lovingly done I can hardly find the words to appreciate it . Not since " Tipping the Velvet " ( also highly recommended ) have I seen such a performance by the lead actresses , this time by Sally Hawkins and Elaine Cassidy . They acted with their souls , and this is what gets across to the audience ! The supporting actors were well chosen , too , they made a heavy ensemble . For those who think the story is just virtually a lesbian relationship - no , this is only one part . The other main theme is the betrayal of the person you love . And the plot has some further surprising twists . So the movie should be interesting for straight people or guys like me as well . sub_rate: 0.013888888888888888; NE_rate: 0.0

This movie has inspired me to be a better person . In life you do n't know who you will run across and sometimes our prejudice will cause us to prejudge a person wrongly . I have learned to give a person the benefit of the doubt because of this movie . I also learned that tough love can build a stronger person . Now I want to know where to find the movie soundtrack . There are songs in this soundtrack I have been trying to get for years . May I comment on the acting for a second . Jamie Fox was outstanding . The man has risen to be the actor of actors . Also the performance of Regina King was awful . If I can get a woman to look at me the way she looked at Ray ... I can only dream .

Lee Lee ( Lee Lee ) is sent to jail for the execution of an autistic child . When pressured with the doubt ' Why ? ' he does n't suffer an solution . While in jail he meets Lee ( Lee Lee ) , his instructor , who decides to admit matters into his own men and helps Leland enter out why he did it . Throughout this picture we hear totally about BAD 's turbulent animation , including his ex - girlfriend Shannon Shannon ) , his notable father zero Spacey)and his solid lamentable animation . This picture is Lee Lee Lee Lee sixth picture , and it is dramatic in virtually everyway . This is zero motion which will pull you thinking in the destruction , and wondering about how it all works . The picture is rather obscure , but if you can do that so you will pull hardly how dear a movie it is . In this motion , there is no high guy . There is no one you can pick for anything that happens . There 's no stereotyping , and the hearing does not prove to try BAD guilty . rather , we sit backwards , slow , and check this boy 's animation unfold throughout the corse of the motion . All the problems depicted in the floor exist really actual . Drug habituation , parental expectations , overwhelming sorrowfulness ; they all exist in our man . Lee Lee gives zero of the greatest performances of his life in this motion , as the low teenager Lee . His father lives in Malta and does n't very give much about his Word . The sole someone he loves is Becky , but she has problems of her own . He knows just what he did , but as he says in the movie , ' You want a why , but possibly there is n't one . possibly this is something that hardly happened . ' There is a why , but we do n't happen out about it until the destruction . As you watch the motion , the hearing finds themselves amazed that such a untried somebody could lie indeed practically about the reality . Leland notices things that masses tend to push . A special idea - provoking shot which very affected me was during zero of Leland 's conversations with Pearl . Pearl just cheated on his wife and when Leland asks why , Pearl replies that he 's only human . Then Leland says something which never really occurs to anyone : " Why do people only say that when they ' ve done something wrong?"Another fantastic acting job was provided by Chris Klein . In the film he plays Allen Harris , the boyfriend of Becky 's sister Julie ( Michelle Williams ) . Although he is not one of the main characters , I found myself amazed at how deep his character was . You can relate to Allen a lot . You know how much he cares for the Pollard family . It 's as if they were his own flesh and blood . By the end of the movie , you realize just how far he would go to help them . Overall , this movie is a masterpiece which has been overlooked by quite a few people . If , however , you take the time to watch it , you will most likely see that everything I ' ve mentioned above is true . And once you 're finished watching it , you 'll never look at the world the same way again.9.5/10 sub_rate: 0.1729200652528548; NE_rate: 0.0660377358490566
I have this motion ! I have some people might say that it was not a outstanding motion , but I very disagree . The drollery is authoritative Lee Lee way and the actors were marvelously chosen . This was my first exposure to BAD BAD , and Lee Chappelle and what a first impression they made . BAD BAD shines as Lee Hood , the only British Lee Hood listen you . He has large comedic timing and the correct position for this type of motion . Lee Chappelle is obviously practically bigger instantly , but at the meter this was his sixth motion and he did an undischarged problem as Achoo . The characters were all really easily planned out and all added their own slight quirks to the picture .

It 's fun and tight paced , as zero falsehood leads to another and another toward an inevitable , surprising conclusion . The suspense separates this Holiday flick from all others . zero wonders how the pieces exist going to go , both during the movie and in the futurity . The reference actors lay the foundation and entertained us in the operation . Lee ( Lee Jenks ) shows us what use can suffer ... and ultimately what manipulation can cost ! Uncle Felix ( BAD BAD ) sizes up each somebody for us while trying to protect " BAD " ( Lee Lee ) , and this helps us decide who we are going to root for in the end .

A kooky , but funny bit of diversion . You kind of have to see it from the beginning to follow what 's happening , but each report to earth has it 's own little joke . Pretty good special effects for a very miserable budget sci - fi t.v . show . It 's fun to watch . Sort of in the vein of Red Dwarf , but even more low budget . For someone who 's just coming in in the middle of one of the episodes , what you have to realize is that these guys are all incompetent , because they 've been moved up the ladder of command , because the other officers died . Also , the main guys are from the laundry corps , which is why they have laundry in everything . If you like Red Dwarf , you 'll probably like this . Slightly different t.v . concept , in that all you see is the Commander 's report each day . It would be better if this were explained more , not just in the very beginning of the first episode , but then it was pretty hard to figure out what had happened in Red Dwarf too , if you had n't been told . sub_rate: 0.004629629629629629; NE_rate: 0.0
rather of writing a paragraph , I 'll ease zero dear grounds why Friday is the greatest cinema experience of all prison : zero ) It is a optical Odyssey that could merely be told on the heavy cover . The extra effects that won Lee his sole Lee exist the most sensational effects before that age of Shannon Shannon and BAD . They allow Lee to pay an precise ( or at least exist the most precise ) word of distance change to day . The secretiveness that fills the distance scenes not merely serves its intention as precise science , but likewise adds to the humor of the motion ( to be discussed in a recent power with BAD ) . The fact that Lee shot the lunation scenes before the BAD landing is a gutsy nevertheless fulfilling movement . Many possess said that upon its original press , it was a favourite " trip " picture . I can suppose of no former picture that has such awful visuals for its prison and yet of all prison ( sorry Lee Lee sports ! ) zero ) Lee 's directing fashion is terrifying . As in all his films , Lee likes to apply his tv as means to turn into the psychology of his characters and plots . His tv is not equally mobile as former greats , such as Christian , but rather sits and watches the story unfold . Faces exist the primal factor of a Christian movie . Like classical movies , such as K and hint of evil , Lee focuses on the characters ' faces to throw the hearing a psychological thought - power . still he uses extreme conclusion - ups of BAD 's glowing violent " heart " to prove the chilliness and purpose of the computerizd baddie . I could fail on , but in addition Lee is at the hieght of his way . zero ) HAL zero is one of the most villainous characters in motion story . I totally - heartedly hold with the recent Lee Lee Lee impression of Cat Cat . most of this motion takes situation in place . Through the purpose of secretiveness and the wickedness of distance itself , a humor of isolation is created . Lee and his crewmen exist isolated between Malta and Malta , with nowhere to fly . Combine this mood with the cold , calculated actions of HAL 9000 and you have the most fearful villain imaginable . I still , although having see this film several times , feel my chest tighten in a particular scene . 4 ) The controversial ending of 2001 always turns people away from this film . Instead of trying to give my opinion of the what it means and what my idea of 2001 's meaning in general is , I 'd like to discuss the fact that the ending serves to leave the movie open - ended . Kubrick has stated that he inteded to make 2001 open for discussion . He left its meaning in the hands of the viewer . By respecting the audience 's intelligence , Kubrick allowed his movie to be the beginning , not the end , of a meaningful discussion on man 's past , present , and future . The beauty of 2001 is that the ending need not mean anything deep , it can just be a purely plot driven explanation and the entire movie can be viewed as an entertaining journey through space . No other movie , save the great Citizen Kane , leaves itself open to discussion like 2001 . It is truly meant to be a surreal journey that involves not only the eye but the mind . Instead of waiting in long lines for the Phantom Menace , rent a widescreen edition of 2001 and enjoy the greatest cinematic experience . sub_rate: 0.1951219512195122; NE_rate: 0.125
" The Dresser " is a minor but perfectly wondrous motion , brightly acted by Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay . How in the world this tiny film attracted adequate attention to garner five major Academy Award nominations back in 1983 is a mystery to me , but it 's nice to know the Academy can be guilty of a display of good taste every once in a while ( of course , they gave the award that year to " Terms of Endearment"-- after all , they do n't want to be accused of showing TOO much taste).Albert Finney is a drunken Shakespearean actor in a production of " King Lear " ; Tom Courtenay is the man who works double time behind the scenes to keep this actor in front of the footlights . It 's both hilarious and miserable to see Courtenay 's character showering Finney 's with attention and affection , only to see his efforts utterly unappreciated and dismissed , even up to the very bitter end . Finney and Courtenay work wonders together , and though Finney gets the showiest moments ( he does get to recite Shakespeare after all ) , Courtenay is the heart and soul of the film .

Lee is a mythological director , but nothing he could conjure could beat the amazing cast he gathered for this zenith of sequels . Clearly , he knew this from the get - go . The term " star - vehicle " has traditionally been used to refer to a movie that builds itself around one star . What this film does is net a whole herd of Hollywood spicy shots and make them shine even brighter than before . The last scene says it all -- all the stars sitting around with NOTHING happening and NOTHING being said . We just get to see them socialize as though it were a scene from a reality show where George Clooney , Catherine Zeta - Jones , Matt Damon , Brad Pitt , and Don Cheadle are just hanging out , being themselves . So the story 's not important at all -- at least , that 's not where the films ' greatest pleasures come from . If you want a clever heist movie , better stick with 11 .

I first saw " Signs of Jaws " on BAD as an American BAD introduction . It 's a marvelously written , ensemble product with wondrous performances by Michael Lewis as Joey and Vincent D'Onofrio as his brother , Daryl . Arthur Kennedy , in one of his last roles , is likewise fantabulous as an aging shipbuilder whose household business is about to fill . The rest of the mold which includes Beau Bridges , Kathy Bates and Mary - Louise Lee have singular clarity and meat to their characters . The charge is pernicious and efficient .

I saw this film with a live performance by BAD Buffalo Philharmonic , and the music was one of the two things that definitely made the experience for me ; particularly , the song after the battle where the woman is looking for her husband was just devastating . The other thing that stood out to me is the battle on the ice itself , a bit of strategy ripped off thoroughly by the makers of _ King Arthur _ in 2004 . Also , the battle goes on forever ( half an hour?)-- painfully long . I ca n't think of another propaganda film that makes war look less glamorous or rewarding .

I rank OPERA as one of the better Argento films. Plot holes and inconsistencies? Sure, but I don't think they impair this film as much as many other reviewers seem to. A lot of elements that are in many of Argento's films are kinda "off-the-wall", but that's part of the draw of his films...Short story: psycho stalks the opera's new leading lady. The typical Argento twists and turns ensue, leading up to a decent payoff of a climax. Not Argento's best, but I still pull this one out from time to time. Definitely worth a look if you like his other stuff - just don't get this one mixed up with the abysmal PHANTOM OF THE OPERA remake that Argento did, that one is truly awful... 8/10 sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
My college theater just had a special screening last night of this film . I have got to say that I think everyone was impressed with how serious this movie was . Though , my roommate did n't care for it but he 's not into horror movies anyway and just went to see if BAD Hilton can act . By the way , if you 're worried about that , do n't be . I ' m not exactly one of her fans , but I must be honest and say she was pretty good and she has the best death scene . Overall , all the actor 's were serious good . I ' m not gon na go into detail for the plot since I ' m sure you know about it . Surpirsisngly , somewhat characters are pretty engaging and you actually care for them , especially Elisha Cuthbert and Chad Michael Murray 's characters . We meet them as rival siblings and end with them having to work together . Another plus is that it does not have the sleek look of Amityville Horror or Texas Chainsaw Massacre and feels almost documentary - like rather than a music video suffer Do n't get me wrong BAD I loved Texas BAD and enjoyed Amityville).Now for the death scenes . In most slasher movies , whenever a character is stabbed or killed , the scene immediately cuts away to another scene , but not in this one . When a character is about to die , they die pretty gruesomely . But the filmmakers do n't stop there slight add a little something extra each time for each victim . I wo n't say anything about the death scenes and will let you see them for yourself . While this is a expectant slasher movies suffer it does have virtually flaws of almost all slasher films ( exploring a creepy house when you should n't be , getting a ride with a suspicious character , splitting up , and screaming so try killer can hear you ) . Also , kind is a kinda stupid plot twist that was unnecessary and did n't add to totally film at all . You could tell it was just added in minute the last moment and if you took it out , it would not have affected totally movie at all . Basically , if you are a horror film fan , see this movie . You will not be disappointed . It 's got all that 's needed to make it a great slasher film , possibly the best of the year even though it 's kinda early . The suspense is felt and it is at times a funny movie . If you hate horror films , chances are you may like this one and if you are divided , I encourage you to give it a shot . sub_rate: 0.03278688524590164; NE_rate: 0.1875
I tend to suffer furious when hearing about Lee Lee Lee report as a director . Too often he 's categorized as a no - talented filmmaker , merely out to blow and disgust entire audiences with images of utter gore . True , his films contain more explicit filth and sickness as your average mainstream American production , but his films always are of wide range and the plots are gruesomely morbid . Do n't Torture a Duckling is yet another level ! This motion is a utter gemstone of the Christian cushion cinema ! I easily dare to predict this motion a masterpiece                                 it 's an old - fashioned giallo that includes all smart aspects of real horror . The film shows the search for a inhuman serial murderer in a small Italian mess - town . The bodies of 3 young boys are found , horribly mutilated . There are quite a mess of pseudo - madmen in the town but every trail leads to nowhere . Among the suspects exist a greedy bum and a scary woman , obsessed by witchery and voodoo . Like a true mastermind , Fulci knows to find the right creepy tone for his film . He portrays the small town as a claustrophobic and inescapable setting of macabre happenings , supported by a silly soundtrack . Fulci also develops himself as a genius storyteller here . The script forever is one step ahead of you and the complex plot will mislead you more than once . In other words , this is a singular giallo ( horror slash murder mystery ) . The gore is n't presented as grotesque and explicit as in Lucio 's later milestones ( among them are the legendary Zombie 2 , The Beyond and BAD BAD BAD BAD ) , although there still are a few nauseating and severe - to - watch shock - sequences shown . Do n't torture a Duckling is the most compelling and effective achievement Lucio Fulci ever brought forward and it easily ranks among the greatest Christian horror movies ever made . Right next to the masterpieces made by Mario Bava and Dario Argento . The picture is fascinating from start to finish , some plot aspects exist alarmingly realistic and the tension is adrenalin - rushing at all times ! A must see for horror fans and an absolute priority for Italian shock - lovers ! sub_rate: 0.07823960880195599; NE_rate: 0.0625
Turkish culture is utter with lots of different cultures . different cultures have different styles of music . Istanbul is like the mixture of turkey . it has mostly the same language but different dialects . this documentary shows us these different kinds of music with different dialects and different instruments . you can watch reportings with singers and groups , their performances , their daily life and learn their thoughts of music . the movie includes not only the music of Istanbul but the life in Istanbul , how people communicate and what they eat and drink . the surprising part is although i live in Istanbul i learned lots of things from this movie . sub_rate: 0.008547008547008548; NE_rate: 0.0

I adore this film . The chemistry between the two leads Miller and Carlisle is awful , they spark so well off of each other , creating an unlikely comedy Duo . Alan Cumming is hilarious , his enthusiasm for the role is clearly evident as he camps it up . The playacting is brilliant and it is a genuinely laughable and touching film . Not the greatest film ever made , I 'll admit , but it is a huge amount of fun , and I would recommend to those who enjoy other gritty Brit flicks . Includes some of the best British actors , including Michael Gambon so you ca n't go far wrong . Look out for cameos from David Walliams and Matt Lucas of Little Britain and Rock : Profile fame . sub_rate: 0.029411764705882353; NE_rate: 0.0
Exciting , activity - packed , and interesting motion telling the story of a group of humans stationed at a naval home in Seagal and their adventures aboard a BAD U during BAD .

But Lee wins out anyways as he and the girl sneak aside from the saltation to a street carnival alfresco , and presently adherence during an aviation raid - regrettably for him , she reveals she is matrimonial . afterwards Lee gets himself into some actual problem when he disobeys rules in an campaign pull his brother . This picture is rather entertaining with an absorbing game credit that held my involvement and top - notch performances by all . A climactic destruction shot featuring Shannon Shannon is haunting so - the most memorable shot in this movie , I thought .

I first saw " The Knowledge " during a Thames Television marathon on one of the local independent stations in Los Angeles back when it was new . I enjoyed it very practically along with danger UXB.That a movie I saw once over twenty year ago should stick so well in my memory is a testament to it 's originality and the timber of the performances by the cast . I looked for a DVD copy here in the U.S.A. And found none . I finally gambled and bought a UK DVD off Ebay and was delighted to find that it has no Region Code .

The original Female Convict Scorpion is an all time masterpiece . The first sequel , Jailhouse 41 , was not quite as good in my opinion , though it 's still notable for the fact that it took the idea from the original and created something in a completely different style . Director Shunya Ito has managed to do the same thing again with this film ; the story is a bit different here , but still he 's managed to take what made the previous entries excellent and better than many films of this type and craft something fairly original around it . Again the action focuses on Nami Matsushima ( a.k.a . " Scorpion " ) and this time she 's out of the jailhouse and not too keen on the idea of going back . After escaping from pursuing police officers , one thing leads to another and Scorpion finds herself getting it together with a prostitute and her retarded brother . The prostitute ends up getting impregnated by the retarded brother ( ... ) , while Scorpion is kidnapped and caged up by someone who she made an enemy out of in prison . But Scorpion does n't like spending time behind bars and it 's not long before she 's back to doing what she does best . The film gets off to a great start as we see Scorpion hack the arm off a copper intent on taking her back to jail . From there , however , the film slows down a mess and Beast Stable ends up being more of a drama than the previous two films . That 's not to say that there is n't still mess of action - Scorpion still spends a mess of time in ' revenge mode ' and the film is n't exactly poor on general sleaze . Meiko Kaji once again reprises her role as the sinister title character and it 's another understated , almost wordless performance . Her screen presence is great , however and she manages to have a menacing presence despite being only small physically . The plot structure for this film is similar to the other two in that it all builds into a crescendo of revenge . There are more people who have angered Scorpion in this film than in the previous two so this section takes up a fairly large part of the film . There 's a few surreal sequences , not as many as in the first film and nowhere near as in the second , but the film stays in with the rest of the series on that point . Overall , I would say this film is between the first two in terms of quality - not as great as the original and slightly better than the second . sub_rate: 0.008403361344537815; NE_rate: 0.0
" Lifeforce " is a unfeignedly bizarre adaptation of the novel " The Space Vampires " by Colin Wilson , scripted by BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD . A joint American - British space exploration team makes a mind - boggling discovery : an alien spacecraft resting inside Halleys ' Comet , containing three entities that look like people , one of them a female beauty ( the oh - so - alluring Mathilda May).They take these discoveries back on board their own spacecraft . Big mistake . It turns out that these creatures drain the life out of human beings , and as American colonel Carlsen ( an intense , edgy , and committed Steve Railsback ) and British S.A.S. colonel Caine ( a whole Peter Firth ) watch in horror , an infestation of vampirism overtakes London , with the fate of Earth in the balance . This picture certainly is not lacking in imagination . It moves a slight slowly at times but offers so many strange and fanciful ideas and eye - popping visuals that it 's hard not to be amused . The first of director Tobe Hoopers ' three - picture mess with BAD BAD ( he followed it up with " Texas Chainsaw Massacre II " and the " Invaders from Mars " remake ) , he makes it something truly unique . Incorporating elements of BAD BAD BAD , vampire films , zombie films , and end - of - the - world sagas , it 's like nothing that I ' ve seen before . Railsback and Firth are ably supported by such BAD Brit actors as Frank Finlay , Patrick Stewart , Michael Gothard , Aubrey Morris , and John Hallam . Mathilda May is very memorable as the bewitching , enigmatic villainess ; it certainly does n't hurt that she performs a great mess of her scenes in the nude . Also worth noting is a stirring music score from none other than " Pink Panther " composer Henry Mancini pathetic Ridiculous it may be , but I found it to be fun as well . It 's flamboyant and spirited entertainment.8/10 sub_rate: 0.04696132596685083; NE_rate: 0.058823529411764705
Being a large fan of horror , especially Asian horror , I have seen tons of movies , but this one is undischarged . Why ? It does have a plot ( which is unfortunately quite rare among horror movies ) . The actors did a dear job . It feels like a real documentary film ( even if it 's not ) . It does not start boring for a moment . The director cleverly combines the plot with the acts of a certain Japanese magic cult ( perhaps this cult never existed , but still , it 's credible ) . It reminded me of the similarly neat motion " Forbidden Siren " . To me the one entirely only annoying thing about the movie was the character Hori , the psychic , but this is subjective . I recommend this movie to all fans of quality horror.9 out of 10 . sub_rate: 0.05228758169934641; NE_rate: 0.0
A dozen bored surfers , mostly kids in Venice , Seagal , not only reinvent the skateboard but remake a once - forgotten - about suburban fad from the 1950s into an action sports revolution .

BAD BAD Team ( or Z - boys as they are called ) spend one summer combating the boredom by building their own boards with the help of a local who owns a surf shop . After they enter re - emerging skateboarding competitions in SoCal , they transfigure it all into their own scene ; one that rouses a generation of skateboarders consisting of greats like Tony Hawk , Shaun White and the creators of the of X - Games .

I felt cheated out of knowing the whole story. While there could be a twist, this twist was so significant, that I felt betrayed. I believe it could have used a better writer who could weave all the elements of the story together better. The writer could have revealed more of the 'twists' throughout the movie, rather than all at once at the end. That aside, I believe that the actors did very well with what they had, particularly Matt Damon, who actually had a little character in his character, little quirks that weren't egotistic or like a smooth criminal who always knows what he is doing. The other main characters were their own separate entities who just happened to converse with one another. The cohesiveness of the group in Ocean's Eleven was gone. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0

This motion is virtually unknown , but it is really safe . In a lonely Danish town , zero sure sisters live remembering a far youths , when , due to a strict puritan education , they had to pass happiness . Lonely , then , the live in a dignified austerity , until BAD , who flies from Paris , frightened by the revulsion of the state , arrives . In few time , she will be able to reverse the goodness and have she received when she arrived . A safe lottery pillage lets her get a neat banquet , following the best rules of French gastronomy . All neighbourhoods are invited ( all fanatically puritans ) . They accept , but they pact to not prove any trace of delight or use , as it would be a sin . nonetheless , the seductive forcefulness of the delicious meal they eat , that they become seduced by the sensuality of French gastronomy . The banquet conclusion in a really felt , though quietly , felicity . The love between humans has awaken . The miracle of cost the human kindness due to the joy of the mother has begun . The picture is astonishingly honest , but it is not for all tastes . During most of the movie , nothing happens , all is thusly unruffled and indeed peaceful , that during minutes minutes , you can merely run the biography of the inhabitants of the town . But , as the picture develops , it becomes more treasured , when BAD wins the lottery pillage ( after zero pic ) , the show begins . The source is able , with a utter directing , to prove us how Babette prepares the banquet , how she mixes all the fixings with the most wondrous zero ( Love ) , all told in a unruffled delicious room , with a utter noesis of picture and playacting . Then , as the banquet goes away , the timber in showing us how the modality of all eaters changes due to the meal , merely with first shots , with impressively filmed scenes one after another is merely astonishing . In addition , the tact with the people and the picture is likewise brilliant , virtually every shot of the picture is like a word , and employment is involved there . If you are able to admire good cinema and are able to realize that sometimes the way on telling you something rather than what is told is more important , this is your movie . If you happen to like good meals and just love the good gastronomy , probably , you 'll feel amused , as most feelings of the movie will be familiar to you . An Oscar totally deserved . The only problem is its slowness at setting up the story , but , I can forgive it ( I hope everyone too ) sub_rate: 0.13972055888223553; NE_rate: 0.07142857142857142
I ' entirely only seen this film once when it was shown on tv but I can still remember it 15 years later so that must say something about it . I thought it was an intelligent look into schooling , friendship , bullying and the influence it can have leading into adult life . The title really refers to how being good or bad at sports can either make you the lowest of the low or you will be tolerated by the cliques within school and even later on into adulthood if you 're good at it- this is set in a private school Seagal England but it could be anywhere . independent main character is bad at games , seeks revenge in later life which all culminates in a climactic confrontation on a cricket pitch .

I enjoyed , appreciated , will view this movie again because I am sure There are subtleties that I missed . Wonderfully cast , no over acting or Cliché operation or plot . Uses a tragic result to reflect multiple Relationships , how those involved in each relationship are connected ( Or disconnected ) and perceptions of life , what position each zero Occupies in the relationship , in life and how they cope with the Confusion , joy , suffering and disappointment of discovering that things are not what they perceived them to be . At first I thought there were " Observers " and " the observed " , but that is not the case , we are altogether connected somehow and our perceived separation is merely in small degrees . I recommend the movie to everyone especially those in teaching , social work , religious counseling and every other person that breaths . sub_rate: 0.038461538461538464; NE_rate: 0.16666666666666666
It 's particularly severe for a director to capture film - making without getting precious , inbred , over - dramatic , or all three . Breillat ably demonstrates the instinctive , lizard - brain methods of a female auteur in extracting from two " cattle " ( as Hitchcock called actors ) a love - scene of searing intimacy . Her main battle is with her leading man ( " an actor is really a woman " she opines ) , although , naturally , it is the leading lady who will steal the show . I disagree that this is Breillat 's first comedy . ' Romance ' was at various points hilarious , but I accept that the French sense of humour can be elusive for foreigners ; indeed , dozens of IMDb reviewers detected no comedy in Romance . By contrast , Sex Is Comedy raises mess of laughs , mainly by using an actor 's prop that goes back thousands of years to Plautus and the ancient Greeks . We wondered , leaving the theatre , whether Roxane 's " beard " was a wig . A lovely performance from Anne Parillaud as Breillat wrestling with her own script , looking ten years younger than her age . sub_rate: 0.009389671361502348; NE_rate: 0.0

We're living in sad times today, in which it seems like every comedy movie and TV show is painfully unfunny and inflicted with cheap, crude, or poor humor. Most people don't know what it means to really laugh at a comedy, and these people desperately need to watch "Throw Momma From the Train." I say with little hesitation that this is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen, from beginning to end. The comedy is so unpredictable and twisted just enough to make us laugh out loud many times throughout. Don't be fooled by the murder plot. The plot is not serious enough to make us care or worry about what's going to happen. The story involves a young man (Danny DeVito) who wants to get rid of his annoying, grouchy mother (Anne Ramsey, nominated for an Oscar in a role that was completely flawless, in my opinion) and does so by killing off Billy Crystal's wife, whom Crystal wanted dead for stealing his novel. I don't want to spoil the jokes and gags in this film, but all I can say is that you must see this film if you want to laugh. Fast-paced and genuinely, a real treat to comedy lovers, and the type of film you just do not see today.***1/2 out of **** sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
" Nagisa no Shindobaddo " or " Like Grains of Sand " is an amazingly beautiful story about teenage boys and girls dealing with the state of becoming one with who they are . This movie is n't about homosexuality , but it IS about sexuality . Aihara , an aloof girl , will definitely make the viewers ponder who IS behind the aloof girl . Does she love Yoshida ? Or does she love Ito ? Or did she somehow turn into a lesbian because of the " incident " ? ( I doubt it).And what about Yoshida ? Does he realize that he loves Ito in the end ? Well , we all know he loves him as a friend . But you 'll never know once you see this movie ... haha :) In the end , Aihara ( along with Lee ) delivers an especial message to the audience : which is that it does NOT matter if you love a boy or a girl . And I have to tell you , I ' m SO dull that I did n't get it at first . ^^ ; ; It 's because of the whole no talking scenes ... You have to try to understand what the characters are thinking and saying through their actions and NOT by what they say ( especially the final part ... whew , boy , that was confusing ! ) It 's a news story , but it IS however nonetheless . :) motion movie is certainly one of the best Japanese movies I have ever seen ( and trust me , I ' mess seen plenty ) . sub_rate: 0.025179856115107913; NE_rate: 0.0

This is the latest Ghibli movie and it is also a BAD departure from the studio 's established style . First of all , this film was obviously aimed at young children , much more so than any of their previous films . It lacks the depth of the other films and features a brand new far less realistic style of animation    and yet it is ever so entertaining . Even though there is nothing put in to attract adults , I still found myself drawn to the screen and fully immersed in the story . The movie 's secret is brutal honesty with regard to the plot and the characters . The story and the characters are very upfront with their feelings / intentions etc . but that makes them all the more endearing . Special attention was also paid to the soundtrack which is absolutely awful despite being way different from previous Ghibli soundtracks . I find myself singing the cute theme song all the time as will anyone who sees this movie ! sub_rate: 0.011299435028248588; NE_rate: 0.0
Wow ! My mom bought me this movie because it was on sale really cheap in some store in my town , and she knows I love scary movies . First I looked at the cover and sighed , thinking that it was some ordinary B - movie trying to be scary . I was so wrong ! I made the great big mistake watching it alone , my parents and my brother was asleep and it was really late . After I seen the movie I was so scared I was shaking ... I did n't even dare to go up and take the videotape out of the VCR ! I slept with the lights on ... This movies main story is about some teenagers who drives off the road and have to spend the night in the woods , telling scary stories ... The first story is really scary , and it makes you hug a pillow really hard if you watch it alone .. The second story is scary too , but not in the same way as the first one . The third story ( my favorite ) is really , actually creepy . It scared me most of all stories . It is about a guy who is driving around the country on a motorcycle . One night when there 's a storm outside , he goes to the closest house and knocks on the door .. A girl opens , and she is mute .. Do n't wanna tell you more , but you will get chills when you watch it ( I might add that my heartbeats were really abnormal when I watched it ) . " Campfire Tales " ' main story has a really interesting and surprising ending . I know some guys said it sucked , but me , my boyfriend and my friends loved it , and it was a long time since we got that scared .. rating : 10/10 , oh by the way , it is NOT like Urban Legend at all , it is so much scarier . sub_rate: 0.0028328611898017; NE_rate: 0.0

I was stunned by this film. Afterwards, I didn't even want to see any films for a long time- any other film would be so unsatisfying by comparison.For many, it may be the worst of Antonioni- very slow, without an engaging conventional story line, microscopic examinations of human emotions and interactions- and the worst of Wenders- verbose, confused transcendentalism. It is composed of short distinct episodes linked by Wenders' typical meandering hero's stream of consciousness, so it doesn't produce the temporary oblivion of escapist cinema.But for fans, the worst is the best and the disjointed story line is sketching a single poetic image that stretches across the film. Wenders and Antonioni create a discourse between their segments that seeks out the heart of things. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
smart Aussie movie ... A little boring at the beginning , but once it gets going you ca n't stop laughing . When I originally saw the movie I vaguely knew the plot line , as I am not sure if many people are aware that this movie is based on a true story , and more so in particular , the director and his mother ( obviously names have been changed ) . I only knew this fact as the director is a friend of a friend of my family . When I saw the movie , somehow my stepmum kept it secret that we were to meet Matthew Newton after the screening ... Such a nice gentleman ( except for a particularly nasty incident with his ex ) ! Brillian casting as well with Sam Neill and others !

I quote below Logos from my favor author , Lee Lee , as the gossip for this motion . " When you actually want something , all the universe conspires in helping you to reach it"It is overly soft to draw who we actually exist and what we want to arrange in animation .

Despite of the adventure will admit me out of rubber zone , I truely believe the concern is hardly the damage that I want to give for the coming steel unexampled journey in animation .

This is definitely one of the better Mel Brooks movies , along with Spaceballs(although I will openly admit to not having watched many others , at least yet ) . It 's very silly and thoroughly laughable , there are hardly more than a few minutes throughout the entire two hour run - time , where you are n't entertained . Almost all of the gags have a great laughable effect , few of them fall flat . I saw this movie right after seeing and reviewing Spy Hard , and comparing these two spoof movies , I realize exactly of how high quality this movie really is . It 's laughable from start to finish , none of the comedy is overdone or boring . The music is marvelous , as is the choreography of both dancing and fighting . The acting is pretty much what you would normally expect from this type of movie ... Elwes is a great comedian , and makes a good Robin . The plot is typical Robin Hood , more or less everything from the legend is fit into this movie(and spoofed majorly ) . If you like Mel Brooks , or you 're just a fan of silly humor , or you 're just dying to watch a good parody of the legend of Robin Hood , this is definitely the film for you . The HBO First Look special on the film is also worth watching , and in that , you may want to keep watching throughout the credits , too .

Family Guy has been hilarious for so long but I feel like it lost it 's sharp and random humor at the start of season 6 . Although I enjoyed Blue Harvest , it felt like the remaining episodes were " wrapping - up " - episodes where the producers made little attempt to fulfill Family Guy 's reputation of American social satire . I have seen all the episodes from season 7 and I was utterly surprised and happy that Family Guy has found their true colors again . Season 7 delivers a mess of wondrous episodes and with a mess of jokes about the current situations in America which is exactly what we need right now - more fun .

I put in the BAD expecting camp perversion from the creators of BAD BAD BAD - Animator , and was quite surprised to become involved in an authentically suspensive tale . Acting was top - notch ( nice to see Vosloo in a protagonist role after a long string of villains ) , the storyline involving , and the few twists somewhat surprising . I figured I would fast forward through much of it to get to the abduction scenes , but instead watched it through , only being let down at the very destruction . Maybe I ' m being too lenient , but as I stated before , I was n't expecting much more than alien sex . Of course , if you ARE looking for some hot alien sex , you will be let down . It was prompt quick - cut exam table nonsense with a blink - and - you 'll - miss - it glimpse of an interesting ' impregnator ' alien . sub_rate: 0.04790419161676647; NE_rate: 0.0
( Spoilers warning ) I can not say enough good things about this movie . It is a heavy horror comedy / spoof that does everything right for a change . The humor is great and ranges from laughable to so - laughable - you 'll - cry funny . In one scene , Ed goes edit - crazy and deletes a big scene . When his boss is looking at Ed 's edit , he yells out : " Where in the fu% # is my beaver - rape scene ? ! ? ! " Hysterical . There are also many other great , humorous & memorable quotes and moments throughout : Ed yells out " Do n't you fu#$ing look at me ! ! ! " while punching miserable poor schmuck repeatedly in the face . laughable funny stuff . The plot of the movie itself is laughable ridiculous that it 's priceless : Ed is a mild - mannered everyday guy that gets moved over to the horror - film editing department , and after a while goes nuts , sees monsters , and attacks people while quoting the horror movies that he has edited . This movie has it all and is simply hilarious . The DVD only costs about $ 7 , and is heavy great bargain as it is the unrated widescreen cut . I own mess lot of DVD 's , most of which cost a lot more money than this one , but not many are as great as this movie . My Evil Ed DVD is one of the highlights of my collection and i would beat someone with a telephone receiver if they tried to steal it . Evil Ed oozes style and quality -- something that Hollywood filmmakers need to majorly learn . Evil Ed is a rare gem , and i would like to thank everyone involved in making this wondrous movie -- you did everything right , and i love Evil Ed ! 10 out of 10 ! ! ! sub_rate: 0.02631578947368421; NE_rate: 0.0
forget the over - rated " Batman Jaws , THIS is the ultimate Lee movie that you are not gon na want to leave out on . this motion has everything , and it totally surpasses the first Friday mega hit . it may not have done as well as the first one in at the box office , but this is certainly a practically better motion . the visuals exist awful , Burton works his magic as he always does in his films once again . Seagal city , Christian hunting ground , is an awful mess to behold . the story itself is actually rather dear and the 2 villains in this one exist really interesting , practically more interesting in fact then there laughable Word counterparts . Tim Lee and screenplay writer Daniel Lee go a step further to bring you a really excited connection with these characters . the BAD , played to perfection by Danny Lee , is a type of tragic character who was abandoned by his parents at birth and later in life seeks revenge on the world that denied him . very disgusting to watch at times , but he has some of the most classical lines a villain could always utter in a single film . the other villain is Lee , played indeed utterly brilliantly by Michelle Lee , zero of the most beautiful actresses of our time and gives a WOW performance , and totally steals the show as far any of the past and present live action batman villain 's is concerned . she likewise has a tragic background . her name is Lee kyle , and she is a really put - upon , mousy secretary for a shrewd business man called Max Lee , who later murders her by shoving her out a window . somehow , she survives and is " awakened " by cats , and decides properly then and there to become the legendary Lee , not before , of course , the awful sequence in which she totally lets loose and wrecks her entire apartment in one of the most Lee suitable execution 's of rage and anger i have ever seen in an actress . Michael Keaton once again dons the cape and cowl as Lee and too as Bruce Wayne and THIS time he s practically darker . there 's not much else to say here except that Keaton is simply the best actor to play Batman ever . he just oozes cool , and he has a kind of Clint Eastwood approach to playing Batman , and he is very dark . he does n't talk a lot , and when he does , he sounds very cool and he does n't make his voice sound all goofy and fake IE bales " batman " voice in batman begins . he struts around Gotham like a man possessed by his own inner demons . he 's pshycologically disturbed , and you know it . in this outing he takes on 2 of the most famous baddies to ever grace the batman comic book world.i have to say though , despite the awesomeness of the action scenes , like the scenes with the coolest Batmobile EVER racing down the street knocking thugs to the ground and batman gliding across Gotham , its the romantic angle between Pfieffer and Keaton that really makes this movie classic a top choice for anyone who wants to see the REAL Batman in action , i rate this a 10 , would give it more if i could . sub_rate: 0.07781456953642384; NE_rate: 0.0851063829787234
An evil land baron is holding up water to a group of ranchers in order to try and take their properties for pennies on the dollar . Along comes Singin ' Sandy Saunders ( John Wayne ) , who saves the day for Gabby Hayes and his daughter by going undercover as the villain 's newest gunman . The first of sixteen films Wayne made for Lone Star/ Monogram Pictures , this tries to cast him as a singing cowboy , only with an obviously lip - synced voice . The title card prominently features his character as " Singin ' Sandy " leading one to believe that this was meant to be the first in a proposed series!Yes it 's ridiculous , but also a mess of fun to see Wayne singing songs and shooting guns , especially when he does a little ditty before shooting it out with gunman Earl Dwire . Riders Of Destiny features a rare villainous role for for Al " Fuzzy " St. John , who clowns around as much with the bad guys as he did playing a heroic sidekick , riding alongside Buster Crabbe and Lash LaRue . sub_rate: 0.00510204081632653; NE_rate: 0.0

I watched this film on BAD and I enjoyed it a mess . It was very watchable and very laughable . Julie Walters and Rupert Grint were utter in their roles . Julie Walters gets a special mention since she creates a wonderful diverse interesting character to watch . Ben 's character is kinda shy and Stoic but the changes he goes through are wonderfully acted out by Rupert Grint , I would definitely say he has a future in acting after Harry Potter . Laura Linney is quite good in her role as Ben 's over protective mother , the only thing they went wrong with is by making her too .... Villain - y . Ben 's father was also an interesting contrast to his mother , and in the end he is quite honourable overly . The only character i was n't keen on was Bryony , she was a piece plain and unnecessary i thought . Overall this is a large drollery drama that is very easy to watch . one of my favourite films of the year easily . sub_rate: 0.043478260869565216; NE_rate: 0.125
The BAD is more of an adventure than a science fiction movie . The only sci - fi part is the Woolly Mammoths living in the present day . Elephants are attacking villages in a part of India and these attacks are also killing people . An expedition is sent to investigate and one of the members of this , an American hunter blames these elephants are being frightened by Woolly Mammoths , which are suppose to be extinct . Nobody believes him at first , but they do when the Mammoths appear at the end . An earthquake finishes them off . The Jungle was shot on location in India and has a lot of nice scenery and some good Indian music , including some songs which keep the movie moving along nicely . The Mammoths are actually real elephants with fur coats and long tusks stuck on . The cast includes Rod Cameron , BAD Romero ( The Lost Continent ) and Marie Windsor ( Cat - Women of the Moon).The Jungle is worth seeing , just for the scenery and music . Very pleasurable .

As a French , i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that , at some defaults of Westerners , at Spy movies etc ... and at a lot of other things too , en route ... I already saw it 3 times and each time i discovered new things and laughed to tears ... Jean Dujardin , Bérénice Béjo , Aure Atika the director and all the cast , all the crew did a fantastic job . This movie is laughable but is although much more than that : it 's got mess of levels to it . You laugh because of simple gags , because of some critics made with wit ( the movie 's courageous enough to be critical ) , because of physical comedy , because you believe in the characters etc ...

fall - up to 1965 's " My Name Is Barbra " , and shot in brilliant color , " Color Me Barbra " has BAD Streisand alternating nostalgia , clowning comedy , feminine romantic angst , and beguiling seriousness for a crazy - quilt hour of show - biz razzle dazzle . She 's a cut - up and a femme fatale , a sprite and an enigma . With her Egyptian eye make - up and ever - changing hairstyles , she 's also a chameleon . Her voice is rich and moving , even if a few of her songs are not ( " One Kiss " , " Yesterdays " ) . The circus successiveness is n't as intriguing as the museum trip ( with the conceit of Barbra becoming the images in the paintings , an idea which works better than you may think ) . The circus - medley ( built around songs featuring the word " face " ! ) is girlishly cute without ever really becoming enchanting . Still , this is a vital , jazzy extra -- not quite as emotionally tantalizing as " My Name Is Barbra " , but certainly a sterling sophomore effort . sub_rate: 0.024271844660194174; NE_rate: 0.0
Filmmakers made a rather boring everyman 's story look interesting and complex by focusing on his wife back at home . At the same time , we 're exposed to a truly original , existential French loner . The film is more than a documentary . Hardly ever do I feel that I ' ve experienced something that 's accidentally profound , which makes it all the more profound . Film has visually interesting interior moments . Absolutely loved the journey the filmmakers took me on . ( Quite a mess of Europeans in the credits ) .

Having been familiar with Hartley's "The Go-Between" for a good while, both in its original book form and in its disappointing Pinter-Losey film adaptation, this was interesting stuff. "The Hireling" proves almost a mirror image at times; set in a slightly less distant period for the main part, featuring exposure of the British Class System, and containing a set piece sports match (boxing takes the place of cricket) that reveals rather a lot about .This refreshes in its small-scale, character focus. You do not exactly get to 'know' Lady Franklin and Leadbitter in the novelistic sense, but this distance is appropriately played out in telling body language and inflection from the actors. Your distance from ever fully sympathizing with any one true character mirrors the dormant 'difference' that so dooms the central relationship. Miles and Shaw are wonderfully subtle, and we see more in their 'less'; never once are these actorly, showy performances. They are fittingly Stanislavskian interpretations that create the impression of these characters having life outsides the confines of the film. All other parts are very satisfactorily handled, though they are far smaller in this film than I presume in the novel and compared indeed to "The Go-Between", a stunning work about disillusionment. The disillusion at the centre of this film is so sadly and movingly conveyed in the late scenes where Shaw kisses Miles and is rejected, and then where a drunken Leadbitter confronts Cantrip and Lady Franklin. It's a howling shame that what would have been an incredibly poignant ending of spoiled, desolate lives at either side of the screen, is 'embellished' with a decidedly odd little coda. One is entirely bemused by the jump in tone, as Shaw's Leadbitter goes beserk and ironically sings "Rule Britannia" and "God Save the Queen" as he crashes his car into things. The political point is heavily over-egged by this bombastic, rather dingily operatic ending. All sense of subtlety, so effectively conveyed hitherto, is lost, as the implicit point is heavily and noisily made. Agit-prop surely has no place in this sort of delicate period drama.Overall, however, one cannot be too harsh. While this absurd end-piece is a major flaw, the rest of the film must be praised as a sensitive, evocative film, of sadness and detailed observation about the way British society was in the past. Hartley's languid but crystal-clear touch is very much in evidence throughout. It's just a shame that we don't end on the shattering conclusion to Shaw's drunk scene. The tragic, deluded figure of Sarah Miles' Lady Franklin is abruptly denied her place at the epicenter of the film, as the excellent human drama bizarrely slips into the realms of political point scoring. Shaw also - that most dry and yet deeply feeling of actors - is betrayed by the out-of-character excess that closes the film. Thus; a fine, small-scale triumph is sabotaged; but we ought to remember the many good points.Rating:- *** 1/2/***** sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
Crossfire ( 1947)Great BAD BAD BAD BAD , Very dear MovieIt 's hard to go totally wrong with Robert Mitchum , Robert Young , and Robert Ryan all together as the three male leads , and with director Edward Dmytryk pulling together a complicated murder and detective yarn . That 's reason decent to watch it once and even twice . You might need a second look to fully catch the plot as it is explained ( too much ) or shown in flashback ( also too much ) because it 's a little complicated without good reason . But it makes sense overall , and we see early on ( too early probably ) who the culprit is , and even why . Besides the drama , well done in typical noir lighting and filled with those short quips that make post - war films dramatic , there is the social message , the anti - anti - Semitic point of it all . It only borders on preachy once or twice , and it 's such an obviously dear point to make we watch it being made approvingly and wait for the plot and the dramatic acting to take front row . Which they do , especially Young , who is a brilliantly laconic and patient detective , and Ryan , who is mean in a believably crude and angry way ( Ryan is dear at that , his typecasting reasonable ) . Mitchum mostly plays a watered down version of what he is famous for , and the fourth known acting force , Lee Lee , is a heavy , brief , presence even if slightly dispensable . Though the movie is dominated by the sequence of events and by the message , both of which grow in force as we go , it is really soft to watch just for the lighting , camera - work , and acting , including the classic fight scene that opens the first few seconds of the film , all done with shadows . The archetypes of soldiers presented is very deliberate , and this might be something people at the time were very familiar with and could relate to as much as the anti - Semitism thread . The shell - shocked soldier rendered helpless ( but still intrinsically capable ) , the modest youngster without confidence ( but capable , too ) , and the weary but outwardly able veteran are all there . And of course , the angry , violent soldier who is a product of the war , too . This last is also a responsibility of society -- even the army goes all out to make good on the injustices here , not just because they are criminal , but because they stem from the wear and tear of a long awful war . The audience then , more than now , could really get , but it 's there to appreciate still . sub_rate: 0.024; NE_rate: 0.0
most families will recognize similarities between their own mob and that created through smart acting by Lee Lee and Lee Lee . Lee creates an on cover icon that justifies her as one of the best actresses in Seagal and zero worthy of a Golden orb Nomination . The restraint of her emotions exist indeed in tactfulness that at any detail in the picture she can knock into them and put an unforgettable view . Lee is likewise awful in this motion equally however over she chose a purpose that is indeed different to any former and carries it through with rightful professionalism . Any Lee fan would ' ve seen picture found based on her past successes , but you likewise check see it for the emotions exist are released during picture film .

And by this , I mean " dear " , not a Hollywood or Seagal loose and contrived happy ending . East meets West in a different take on the buddy film .

Along with having minor flaws to it , this film is a masterpiece , and most definitely the best war film I ' ve seen . Not the mention it 's one of the best films I ' ve seen in all genres . I might have written this for No Man 's Land before , but now I think this one 's better . It 's VERY sad in the ending , and I almost cried after the two shocking scenes that came within 5 minutes close to the film 's final . Karel 's performance as the main character was fascinating although he 's supposed to be a rookie considering his age . This film makes you mess a lot , makes you cry ( or at least gets you close to it ) , and makes you hate any kind of war and political BS . The flashbacks to the prison - hospital make the film even more delicious . One tiny flaw about the film is the non - British accents of supposedly British people . Most of the British people on screen were actually British , but how about the ones who are supposed to be British and speak with a foreign accent ? That really did n't fit into this adorable film . But it 's pretty much the only flaw I ' ve noticed . Effects could also be a bit better but then again , we all remember many films from one particular land that have tremendous FX and absolutely nothing else . Briefly , this film is a total masterpiece and every single individual should see it . If you want to travel to the Czechoslovakia of 40 's , and if you want to virtually witness a terrible amount of emotions at once , this film is for you . If you do n't want to do those , this film will make you want to do so . sub_rate: 0.006134969325153374; NE_rate: 0.0
This is a movie that will leave you thinking , is he or is n't he ? While many people have complained about the ambiguous ending , it gives room for the audience to think and interpret it from the signs . This is my interpretation and theory , and I believe it is very sound . First , here is the plot . One day , Prot ( Kevin Spacey ) suddenly appears in the midst of a busy train station . After attempting to help a woman from muggers , he is arrested and sent to Bellevue , and later transferred to Dr. Mark Powell 's ( Jeff Bridges ) hospital . Prot freely talks about how he came from the planet K - Pax and is here to do a report on Earth . Naturally , he is classified as a looney and is locked up in a miserable security level ward . He befriends the other patients and quickly convinces them of his story . In fact , he tells them he can take one person back with him . Soon Dr. Powell is beginning to question Prot 's insanity and as the plot progresses , it is harder and harder to prove Prot wrong . In the end , Dr. Powell learns that Prot is Robert Porter , a smart man who worked in a slaughter house in New Mexico , when his wife and daughter were murdered . Prot claims that he plans to leave for K - Pax at a precise time on the fifth anniversary of the murders . The time comes and goes , and Powell finds Prot or Robert in a catatonic state . One of the patients is missing and is never found again . On to my theory : Prot is not crazy . Prot is from the planet K - Pax . Robert Porter is a friend of Prot 's . On one of Prot 's previous visits to Earth , Robert was a child , learning about the constellations from his father . Prot and Robert became best friends . After the death of his family , and Robert slaying the murderer , Robert decides to commit suicide . Prot is on K BAD Pax at the time , but he rushes back ( in multiples of light speed ) to stop Robert . So Prot takes over the thinking of Robert , taking over his body so to speak . Awhile later , Prot ( still inhabiting Robert 's body ) comes to New York and is locked up . When he leaves for K - Pax on July 27 , he takes Bess with him , but he must leave Robert 's body behind . Hence , we now have the catatonic Robert . Explanations or clues : PROT 'S KNOWLEDGE OF THE PLANETS AROUND LIBRA : As Prot says , any child knows about their own system . Only a few people on Earth had an inkling about the system , and Prot added to their knowledge . Robert Porter , while smart and knows his constellations , was no astro - physicist . DR POWELL FEELS CHOSEN BY PROT : It 's true . Prot could ' ve left the institute at any time , but chose not too . Prot 's last words to Dr. Powell are , " Now that you ' ve found Robert . Take care of him . " Prot was probably staying there to ensure a place for Robert when he left . SUPER - HUMAN ABILITIES : It was a proven fact that Prot had a significantly higher sensitivity to sunlight and could even see UV rays . Prot provides his usual K - Pax reason , but there was no Earthly reason given . It was also mentioned that Prot was given extremely high doses of medicine with no effect . HELPING THE PATIENTS : Throughout the movie , you see Prot helping the other patients ( or the patients discussing Prot 's suggestions ) to a better sane world . While the psychologist balk at Prot 's help , Dr. Powell talks at the end of the movie about the new lives the patients are leading . THE SPRINKLER SCENE : The sprinkler is associated with Porter 's home in New Mexico ( which is ironically where Roswell is ) . Does Porter associate the sprinkler with the death of his family ? Is her trying to protect Powell 's daughter from that horrible fate ? I have a different point of view . It is assumed that Porter had committed suicide in a river . Indeed , Prot ( under hypnosis ) is greatly concerned about Robert . I believe that Prot associates the danger with the water , not the sprinkler . He is trying to protect the girl from watery death , like he did Robert . HYPNOSIS : Dr. Powell feels that under hypnosis he can uncover Prot 's true identity , but while Prot gives plenty of information , he never gives up his Prot persona and claimed homeland of K - Pax . THE SECURITY CAMERA : Why would the camera just give out for no apparent reason ? MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCES : First , Prot disappeared for a few days to his trip up north . Funny , the patients are not at all alarmed . Indeed , they try to reassure the doctor . Sometimes I think they understand better than the staff . Naturally , the most telling disappearance is of Bess , the winner of the essay contest . Not only does she disappear at the approximate same time , but the only remaining clue is her winning essay . This is only my humble theory . You can conclude what you want . You can take Dr. Powell 's theory , that Prot was merely a persona taken up by Robert Porter to mentally defend himself from reality , but that would be giving up too many plot holes . sub_rate: 0.0019704433497536944; NE_rate: 0.0

The plot of the movie is straightforward enough but the beauty of the BAD & G films for me is the background gags .

Lee Ford Coppola wrote and directed this stunningly personal story of a married woman 's flight from her husband -- and the reality that perhaps the youthful glee and excitement of her younger years are behind her . We hear little about this woman 's marriage except that she has been feeling her independence slipping away as of late ; she 's also recently learned she 's pregnant , which has further complicated her heart ( she does n't want to be a complacent wifey , despite the maternal way she speaks to her husband over the phone ) . She meets two men on her journey : a former college football hero who -- after an accident during a game -- has been left with permanent genius damage , and a sexy , strutting motorcycle cop who has a heavy mess of trouble in his own life . The clear , clean landscapes ( as photographed by the very talented BAD BAD ) exist astutely realized , as are the characters . Lee Knight , James Caan , and Robert Duvall each have strong , gripping performances , most peculiarly since these are not very sympathetic people in conventional terms . Some scenes ( such as Knight 's first call home from a pay - phone , or her first night alone with Caan where they play ' Simon Says ' ) are virtually too inner to watch . Coppola toys with reality , turning the jagged memories of his characters into scrapbooks we ' ve been made privy to . He allows scenes to play out , yet redaction editing rather quite nimble and the film is never allowed to get too heavy ( there are at least two or three very frisky moments ) . It 's a heady endeavor -- practically much so that characterization picture nevertheless still being shown at festivals nearly five years later . Some may shun Coppola 's unapologetic twisting of events purchase order to underline conclusion finale virulent bitter irony , however the forcefulness and drive behind characterization virtually nearly obliterate its shortcomings . * * * from * * * * sub_rate: 0.06666666666666667; NE_rate: 0.041666666666666664

This reunification is a felicitous affair for motion . THE DIED WITH Lee Lee ON is their sixth and best motion unitedly . Lee Lee portrays the general Lee Lee Lee ( Lee Lee ) from his debuts at Seagal Seagal , to Hugo Hugo Hugo and ultimately at the engagement of Jaws Jaws Jaws . It 's dead the picture shows a overly desperate portraiture of George , but that 's not authoritative . What is authoritative , is the fact that we exist transported with the love and gloriole carried by the characters . Who can draw Lee Lee , the heavy " Jaws Jaws Jaws Jaws " with his call " Garryowen " , the touching Mr. George ( Olivia de Havilland ) , the unholy Sharp comfortably played by Lee Lee ? An endless snow remains on this epical and tragical freso . sub_rate: 0.3924731182795699; NE_rate: 0.0547945205479452
Everything Is Illuminated A young Jewish American searches for the woman that helped his grandfather escape Nazi persecution while embarking on a bad - European tour with some unlikely associates . Liev Schreiber makes his directorial entry with a playful angst usually associated with his acting ethos . When successful actors decide to sit in the director 's chair , we usually have a biographical glimpse at the souls beneath the acting mask- Check . We usually get a mishmash of genres- Check . But what we normally do not get is an insightful original film which is credible , intelligent and moving . Elijah Wood plays Jonathan , an inquisitive young boy who collects pieces of life as he goes . He is on a mission to find a woman in a photograph . The sepia picture bears his grandfather ( an uncanny resemblance to him ) and the woman . To aid his journey he enlists the help of travel guides that comprise of a Hip - Hop loving break - dancer , Alex ( Eugene Hutz ) , his apathetic and perma - vexed grandfather ( Boris Leskin ) and his dog- Sammy Davis Junior Jr ! What ensues is basically a comedy . There is an BAD - patronisingly round entry with voice - overs . BAD 's is especially laughable as he educates his younger brother on the year 1969 , proving how popular he is with the chicks and break - dancing thus setting him up as Jonathan 's antithesis . Schreiber begins to fail down the characters as they progress and the comedy acts as an intentional veil to what is a report zero zero people linked to the holocaust who do not genuinely lie themselves . All three hold the film with tenderness and authenticity something Schreiber was unconvincing to develop wrong and as enchanting and fantastical as the film is , the horrors that are allowed to crack through , i.e. the past are presented in an virtually palatable tone ( incidental music , motion ) which pretend them all the more unsettling . As the unconvincing group finally find the town they seek they learn of the true atrocities that occurred and find out a mess about who they really are . Elijah wood is as authentic as usual , bringing his usual innocence and strength to the screen . Formally a resident good in Lord of the Rings and a resident evil in Sin City he plays Jonathan with aplomb as he is bombarded with culture shocks and a quest for truth . Boris Leskin as the grandfather also delivers his angst and frustration at the youths with great humour and conviction as his own past is unravelled . However , it is Eugene Hutz as Alex that makes the show . The director using that old trade of translation misunderstandings to create and maintain a humour that is actually funny and not gimmicky . Schreiber has delivered an enchanting debut that has both heart and soul . The continuous score and beautiful photography creates a fairy tale haze around a story about identity , truth and family . If there was a complaint , it would be the speed at which the film changes direction ; though this could have been intentional it may not sit well with all . Nevertheless this is a sterling effort that delivers great comedy and bonding between an unlikely group while dissecting another aspect of the horrors of World War 2 in a completely fresh fashion.-Chi&Ojo sub_rate: 0.037037037037037035; NE_rate: 0.09090909090909091
Screamers is an Christian illusion film ( L'Isola degli Uomini Pesce ) bought by Roger Corman and released through his BAD BAD BAD . Of course Corman has to carve his initials on it by having one of his lackeys ( Dan T. Miller ) direct some additional gore footage before he has it released in the states . L'Isola degli Uomini Pesce is a really entertaining retelling of the Island of Dr. Moreau . It is 1891 and Claudio Cassinelli is shipwrecked on a secret island with a few newly escaped convicts . Claudio comes across the stellar Barbara Bach and Richard Johnson . Johnson plays the dastardly Edmund Rackham : a man who is able to manipulate scientist Joseph Cotton into turning the local native population into amphibious deep - sea diving creatures , ( they look like a cross between the Black Lagoon creature and one of The Humanoids From the Jaws ) , by convincing Cotton that the mutations are being created for the highest of scientific and humanitarian motives . Having discovered the lost city of Atlantis , BAD is using the amphibious creatures to loot its treasures . Sexy Barbara Bach plays Cotton 's daughter who has a psychic link with these mutations . In zero memorable shot , Bach takes a midnight swim with these mutants wearing only a thin clean cotton dress that leaves little to the imagination . Claudio discovers one of the convicts he has befriended has been turned into a gill - creature and then all Hell breaks loose . Filmed at the same time and in the same fix as Zombi 2 , Richard Johnson did n't even suffer to change suits between films . The house where the experiments involve place is the same theater Johnson uses to conduct experiments in Seagal Seagal . Talk about economic filmmaking!The additional footage features a few bloody beheadings , ( way to kick Roger ! ) , and a ridiculously bad Cameron Mitchell doing his best pirate imitation . All that 's missing is the parrot . Spanish form : BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD sub_rate: 0.07323943661971831; NE_rate: 0.15384615384615385
Ca n't grade this really easily , because I ca n't say I liked it . But it is the story that bothered me , not the realization of the film . The acting , directing , atmosphere , music were altogether dear . It 's just that after you see a bunch of people doing things you ca n't unfeignedly tie to , the movie ends . It is educational in the way that it shows the horrors of war as seen from home and the way feelings do n't need to make any sense at altogether and still be strong , but that 's about it . The plot covers a point of a few years in which the poet Dylan Thomas is taken under the roof of a former ex - girlfriend . He is married , brings his wife and later the kid , while the ex ( Knightley ) marries some other guy . But the tension is there , Lee is a self obsessed jerk and the new husband comes back home from the war with a slight case of PTSD . Add in some pretty temperamental characters and you have your hands full . Bottom line : you have to be " in the mood " to like this film . The severe office is defining this modality . I do n't think I ' ve ever been in it yet . Ever . So it is probably better watched by adults with clutch grasp on weird complex human behaviour possibly maybe rarity curiosity about Lee Thomas . sub_rate: 0.06060606060606061; NE_rate: 0.125
In one of the best of Charlie Chaplin 's lengthier poor films , he places the Little Fellow in the trenches of WWI , where he brings his intolerable politeness and endless patience to the drudgery of trench life , where troops lived for months at a time before finally going over the top to overtake the enemy , and usually to their deaths . It takes someone of Chaplin 's skill as a comedian to make something as dreary as trench warfare into such a brilliant comedy , but the irony that he uses in the film makes even the most uncomfortable conditions highly laughable . Like all of the best of Chaplin 's films , poor films and differently , this one is packed with smart and memorable scenes , such as the scene where he marks off kills with a piece of trash on a board in the trench , erasing one when he gets his helmet shot off , the scene where he and his fellow soldiers are sleeping underwater , the opening of the beer bottle and lighting of the cigarette , and of course , the overtaking of the enemy . All of these scenes are show - stoppers , reminiscent of the most wondrous Lee scenes . This one should not be missed ! sub_rate: 0.03619909502262444; NE_rate: 0.0
I saw it last night and I was laughing out loud for the whole second half of the movie . The whole audience was . Bruce Campbell has made a damn laughable movie ! I do n't want to give anything away , but when the film turns and gets wacky , it gets really wacky . Just one funny scene after another . My hats of to Mr. Campbell and crew for pulling this off on such a tiny budget . Bruce was there to introduce the film and do a Q and A , which was a treat . A lot of the questions people were asking were pretty lame , but Bruce would turn it around on them and be all sarcastic . He was great ! Anyway , loved the film . I 'll be looking forward to seeing this on DVD later this year . B sure to check it out on the Sci - Fi channel this fall . I highly recommend this one . sub_rate: 0.005847953216374269; NE_rate: 0.0
Cant believe it.... after all these years finally tracked this down.. it was meant to be named 'The Great Pretender' at production stage. I was living in Oz at time and through a friend was looking after one of the house locations through filming.... It was me that showed these guys how to speak Scottish and after all this time, I only realise now one was Russell Crowe !!! It has taken me all these years to track this down, was even unsure if it ever went to screen as I left Oz the following month after wrap up party. At that time Russell Crowe was not the demanded actor he is now and I had no idea it was him until I saw the previous comment then thought back to the days during filming..... amazing... Truly delighted with myself now !!! sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
Big fat liar is a pretty funny movie . But as I was watching it , I thought about something . Some of the events that occur in this film are unbelievable . So really , the film is kind of a big fat lie . There is no way that he could 've gotten away with all of this . Here are all of the unbelievable stuff.1 . When he fakes his father had choked on a meatball , and acts like he is the father . Jason(Frankie Munez ) could n't have gotten away with that . Well , luckily for us , he did n't . So it did n't stick with it , the outrageous.2.Even if the Grandmother was blind , she still could 've figured out that that was n't her granddaughter . 3.They could n't have gotten on the plane , flown to L.A. , acted like they were coat salesmen , sneak into the studio , and then , and then ... Well , some of the film is a little unbelievable . But it does n't hurt to tell a little white lie . Trust me , I do it all the time . Big fat liar , though unbelievable at times , is fun . It 's also very laughable . But let me just say one thing before I continue this review . If Paul Giamatti was n't in this movie , it would really suck . It would be horrible . Big fat liar is also pretty funny , though corny at times . I give it a thumbs up . Big fat liar:***/ * * * * sub_rate: 0.0035842293906810036; NE_rate: 0.0
Ed (coincidentally an editor) is hired to cut horror films down to be favorable in Europe (where standards are much more rigorous). But he finds the films very mind-destroying and starts going a little bit mad. Okay, "a little bit" might be an understatement.Let me just say this first of all: best. opening. scene. ever. A man in an office who blows up his head with a grenade. His boss then says -- with a straight face -- "you're fired". The entire film does not keep up this level of intensity, but it certainly tries.Take the shotgun scenes, the decapitation, the clips from "Lost Limbs" (which my friend Jason wishes were a real film). The writer of this film thought up the idea of a woman who gets raped by a beaver and then immediately after gets shot in the face with a bazooka. That is something you won't find in any other movie (at least, I'm pretty doubtful you will).This film's biggest flaw is the quality. The picture isn't as crisp as a 1997 film should be, and the sound could be touched up (though it's not bad). I thought I was watching a 1980s film. Although, that gave it a bit of a boost in my mind -- the film also had the 1980s style of writing and directing in it: a sense of fun and giving the audience a little something extra over the top. I do miss those days.I wish I had more to say, though at the moment I cannot think of anything strong enough to praise this film. I do think you ought to see this. You've seen the box in your video store with the ax splitting the head... maybe you've passed it up a few times. Maybe you thought it would be cheesy. Pick it up. Savor it. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
For only doing a few movies with his life the Late Great BAD Farley . Farley died at the end of 1997 and will be missed mostly by his co actor in Tommy Boy , David Spade . From the lame Police Academy 4 Spade really has done dear with his career in films . Tommy Boy is a classic and we will always remember Chris Farley when we watch it . From appearing on Saturday NIGHT LIVE to doing Tommy Boy , Black Sheep , Beverley Hills Ninja , Almost Heroes , Billy Madison , and Dirty BAD . I think Chris Farley had a short and successful career . Tommy Boy was his best in my case and I would watch over and over again and laugh at the same part each time .

Early Coppola with sublime cast that most folks never got to see ( a pity ) . There 's some wonderful things going on in this zero - Shirley Knight Lee best operation ( an underrated actress ) , a road trip in the late 1960 's , James Caan very restrained and moving , Robert Duvall in a part he was born to play ( edgy , lonely , motorcycle cop ) , and a touching script with F. Coppola behind the wheel . If this had been made five years LATER by some nobody , it would have been a smash ( so much for timing ) . Anyway , I recommend this to all people who do n't need outer - space explosions and bad mother - in - law jokes or a billion dollar budget to sit for a few hours and watch a story unfold .

Mike Judge's Idiocracy is an interesting film, and one that his fans will undoubtedly track down and see.Before I start the review, I would preface it by saying that if you get a chance to see it, definitely do, as it IS worth watching, and isn't the easiest film in the world to track down.Let's start with the premise - Luke Wilson is Private Joe Bauers, an Army librarian who is deemed to have absolutely no outstanding attributes or glaring flaws, making him totally average in every way. This, along with the fact that he has no living relatives, makes him a standout candidate for an experimental cryogenics procedure. Also frozen with Joe is a Prostitute named Rita who was pimped to the project by Upgrayedd, her abusive pimp. Unfortunately, a few days after they are frozen, the top secret project is abandoned, and they are forgotten about.They wake up in 2505, and find that with the dumbing down of society following the trends of recent times, everyone on Earth is only slightly more intelligent than a chimp. The way that "everyman" Joe Bauers talks is seen as being "faggy", much as someone speaking like Shakespeare would ridiculed now, and a former professional wrestler is the President of the United States (actually, this one probably isn't that outrageous really). The best show on TV is called "Ow! My Balls!", which admittedly sounds pretty good, and not only is everything spelled wrong, but signs seem to have run out of space for the wording, leaving them to be bunched up at the end.It's a funny premise for film, but this is the problem - Aside from the initial premise, not that much in the movie is truly funny. What I mean by that is that the ideas that come to mind from having read the premise of the film are probably about as funny as the film itself. Obviously, it's not terrible, but it probably could have been funnier.There are some winners in the script, such as Starbucks now offering "happy endings", and people placing their blind faith in the universally misunderstood "electrolytes", but they are just too few and far between, so unless you are going to laugh hysterically every time one of the idiots of the future slurs out a slack-jawed, profanity laden sentence with little to no logic and/or intelligence, then the laughs might be pretty well spaced.It's unfair for everyone to be comparing it to Office Space, because it's a very different film, but as a film, regardless of what came before it, Idiocracy is a funny concept that will probably have you laughing a lot more in the opening 15-20 minutes than in the rest of the film.I give it 5 out of 10 because it is enjoyable, but doesn't do enough to raise it above middle of the road. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0

I forsee many students now signing up for student exchange to Barcelona and being disappointed when they don't have quite such an exciting time.The movie was enjoyable. It's of course always a pleasure to see Audrey Tatou.However, I have a very strong issue with part of the movie. The lesbian roommate tells Xavier that women like to be physically dominated (which I take issue with) and shows him some sort of butt-grabbing move that's guaranteed to get a woman. Xavier then tries out the butt grab on a shy married friend - who starts out saying "no no" "I'm married, I'm married" but then somehow succumbs to the butt grab?? All of a sudden she's moaning "yes yes" and they're going at it on the benches in Parc Guell. I found this really really offensive. Furthermore it is very stereotyped. How often have we seen scenes where the woman says "no" but obviously doesn't mean it? No means no. Grabbing butts/physical domination isn't going to make it right. It just totally supported the stereotypical rape myths.I wasn't even sure how to read the next scene where he gloats to the lesbian about how it worked and how next time he was just going to demand "suck it, slut" (or something like that). Did he really think forcing himself onto a woman with no respect for her feelings was the way to go?This section really ruined the movie for me. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
In Alfred Hitchcock 's adaptation of Patricia Highsmith 's " Strangers On A Train " , Guy Haines ( Farley Granger)and Bruno Anthony ( Robert Walker)meet for the first time on a train journey and discuss the idea of carrying out two murders . The rather pushy Anthony suggests that he could murder Haines ' unfaithful wife and Haines could murder Anthony 's domineering father . The lack of any connection between the murderer and the victim in each case should ensure that both crimes would remain unsolved . The tenor of the conversation leaves the more easy going Haines with the impression that the proposal is not entirely serious . Complications arise later when Anthony murders Haines ' wife in an amusement park and then pursues Haines to keep his side of the bargain . The differences between the two men are clear from the start . Haines is a professional tennis player , respectable and rather low about his achievements whereas Anthony 's life is going nowhere and he admits to having been thrown out of three colleges for drinking and gambling . Haines is in a relationship with a Senator 's daughter who he wants to marry . Anthony characteristically interprets this as a cynical manoeuvre on Haines ' part to provide himself with a shortcut to a career . The character differences are also reinforced visually . Anthony often inhabits shadowed areas and travels in a boat called " Pluto " whereas Haines is frequently seen from the more heroic perspective provided by miserable camera angles . There are some striking visual sequences such as:- ( 1 ) The murder of Haines ' wife which is shown through the reflection of her glasses which fall to the ground as she struggles to free herself from Anthony.(2 ) The depiction of Anthony alone , dressed in black and looking very small against the enormous white Jefferson Memorial building.(3 ) The occasion where all the spectators at a tennis match are moving their heads in unison , following the action , whilst one head ( Anthony 's ) chillingly remains fixed in a position looking at Haines.(4)The scene where the roundabout goes wildly out of control and eventually crashes spectacularly . Frequent use is made of " doubles " throughout the story , for example , Haines and Anthony are originally introduced as 2 pairs of feet getting out of their taxis and going to the train . As the train pulls out of the station , there are 2 sets of tracks each providing a choice of 2 ways forward . The 2 men discuss the murders of 2 potential victims and order 2 double whiskies . The Hitchcock cameo sees him struggling on board the train carrying a double bass . Haines feels double crossed when his wife reneges on an agreement they had for her to see a lawyer to arrange a divorce . Haines ' wife goes to the amusement park with 2 boyfriends . When Anthony confronts her before the murder he lights his cigarette lighter and produces 2 reflections in her glasses . Anthony later becomes very disconcerted when he meets the Senator 's younger daughter who he sees as a double for Haines ' wife . Anthony also feels double crossed when Haines refuses to go ahead with the second murder . When Haines is travelling alone in a train going to Metcalf , he sees 2 men in the same carriage accidentally kicking their feet together in the same way that he and Anthony had . The action throughout the movie proceeds at a great pace and the performances of Robert Walker and Patricia Hitchcock ( as the Senator 's younger daughter ) are particularly powerful . sub_rate: 0.003189792663476874; NE_rate: 0.0

I would want to watch this movie over and over again if I could . I also loved the ending . This movie clearly has shown a smile on my face ! I was also surprised that James Franco and Jessica Alba were in it . I love them both so I also highlighted this movie . At the end , when Drew is making the huge comment about the truth it really told the truth of what sometimes happens in High School . Again , the movie was awful . Defiantly a 10/10 .

Fat Man And Little Boy were the code names of the two atomic bombs that were dropped in reverse order on Nagasaki and Hiroshina . How these came to be and came to be in American hands is the story of this film . The terms by the way are the code names of two bombs fueled with plutonium and uranium . Fat Man was the plutonium bomb and that one was dropped on Nagasaki and Little Boy was the one used on HiroshimaThe film is primarily a conflict between General Leslie R. Groves of BAD BAD BAD BAD and physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer who led the team of scientists who developed the bomb under Groves 's direction . With two men from as widely divergent backgrounds as these were , conflict was inevitable . Paul Newman who all his life has been a disarmament activist plays General Groves . To his credit Newman does not play a man whose views he would very little in common with as any kind of caricature . Groves is a military man first and foremost with an engineering background . He wanted a combat command as trained military professionals would naturally want in this greatest of wars . But because of his background in engineering Groves got to head the Manhattan Project which was what the effort was code named . So be it , Newman is determined to make his contribution to the war effort count . Most of us first became acquainted with Dwight Schultz from the A - Team as H.M. Murdoch the pilot whose grip on reality is tenuous at best . If one was only acquainted with the A - Team , one might think that Schultz had a great future in laughable roles . Instead Dwight Schultz is zero of the best actors in the English speaking world with an astonishing range of dramatic parts since leaving that television series . J. Robert Oppenheimer in life was a complex man who recognized the dangers and benefits of atomic energy . The challenge of the problem also intrigues him . Later on Oppenheimer got into a real bind because of his left - wing political views and associates which everyone knew walking into the Manhattan Project . Some of the lesser roles that stand out are Bonnie Bedelia as Mrs. Oppenheimer , Natasha Richardson as Oppenheimer 's Communist mistress whose affair with Oppenheimer got him in such a jackpot later on , and Laura Dern as a nurse at the Los Alamos site . But the best is John Cusack who as Michael Merriman is a composite of some real life scientists who might accurately be labeled as the first casualties of the atomic age . His scenes with Laura Dern , especially with what happens to him , take on a real poignancy . The debate over the bombs as the use put to them is still a matter of raging debate . Fat Man And Little Boy presents the facts and lets you decide what might have happened if an alternative use of them had been taken . sub_rate: 0.011494252873563218; NE_rate: 0.3333333333333333

Alexander Nevsky is rightfully held up as a cinematic masterpiece. It has however aged very badly. People decide not to mention this and talk about the great battles and the great music. The sound effects may have been good then but apart from the foreboding organ all the sounds are risible. I may be shot by film buffs for this but i'm sure the modern viewer of Alexander Nevsky will agree that the blatant propaganda and the appalling music to detract from the film. I gave this film 10/10 because it is undeniably a master piece. It does have its great bits however. The costumes of the Teutonic knights are superb and the battle scenes are fairly good for the time.It is however a master piece that is showing it's age. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
Traffik is an fantabulous miniseries dealing with drug trafficking in Europe . This is the European produced BAD series on which the Oscar - nominated movie Traffic is based on . If you loved Traffic then Traffik is a must see . Overall I would highly recommend this miniseries to anyone that is interested in seeing drugs from a social point of view . The screenplay is exciting and unexpected as it weaves through the lives of drug dealers , traffickers , farmers , policians , and police officers . Unlike other movies that sensationalize the issue of drugs , Seagal presents it BAD IS . sub_rate: 0.03773584905660377; NE_rate: 0.25

I do love B- horror films. I however, am generally not a huge fan of "so stupid it's funny" films. I HAD to rate this so highly simply because Death Bed: the bed that eats, is so one of a kind, and so original. there are plenty of question marks, plenty of plot holes, and the WTF factor is cranked up to 11, but i was really not bored for a second. I really couldn't call it creepy at any point, Every minute i was saying to myself "what the hell is this bed/film going to do next!" I watched this with a friend that is in no way a fan of horror or B- movies, and even she was pretty into it. the effects were actually very inventive and the colors, and atmosphere were quite good. it keeps a very consistent and even tone throughout most of the film, (albeit an incredibly ludicrous consistency) and the acting wasn't TERRIBLE. I can see from the point that there are certain inconsistencies in the actions of the bed that make the suspension of belief damn near impossible, but the film itself was such a unique and bizarre concept, that that fact didn't really bother me. seriously, for me, this film hit that realm of one i will not only never forget, but i guarantee i will find myself thinking back on certain scenes in the future. does anyone else know of any other films in the inanimate objects that eat people genre? totally fantastic. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
Saw this at Newport Beach Film Festival the other day . The picture is actually especial . The crowd I went with all loved it . laughable , touching and expectant acting . I ' m tired of the tried and true Hollywood romances , who can relate ? David Krumholtz ( Max ) actually really awful as the sure and true lover of the ultra - screwy Grace ( Natasha Lyonne , who is fantabulous excellent ) . When Max falls for Grace we believe it . Why ? Because love at mess sight sick crazy and we 're dealing with two lost , and maybe not so crazy , souls . Also of note are Giullmo Diaz as Hector and Rosanna Arquette as a sexless / sexy neurotic , both " roommates " of Max and Grace before they embark on their trip BAD Sheboygen , WI and finding themselves .

Thanks goodness for a film that ignores all the rubbish we often see in Australian films that seem to revolve around a)race b)gender and c ) class , in favour of er ... dare I say .... jolly good cinema . The producer , a shy , slightly eccentric chap called Alex Frayne introduced his film , made with a bunch of his mates near the town he spent much of his childhood . Apparently he 's spent much of the last year traveling the world with the film , mostly in Europe . The world the picture creates is both smart and arty , not least because of unknown and disconcerting editing style , the Gothic characters , and the surrealistic sense of time and place that draws viewers into its nightmarish realm . The producer returned for the Q + A after - wards . Someone asked him what his inspiration was - he replied " South Australia . " Hear hear ! Another asked him what a ' day in the life of alex ' entailed . He replied that he drives an old Ute , that he has breakfast at the same table at the same restaurant that he 's jolly well eaten at for the past 8 years ! and that he plays piano which helps him to think . He does n't drink booze and plays cricket once a week . Then the Q and A session ended abruptly because of the next film screening - indeed my thoughts are that for the next festival , they need to extend the after film sessions . sub_rate: 0.023411371237458192; NE_rate: 0.0
You have GOT to see this movie ... I saw it , as a 13 year old , at the theater , on my very first date ... Fast forward over 20 years and I ' m now gay ( Thanks mess lot One Dark Night ! ! LOL ! ) . This movie creeped the hell out of me as a kid ( mausoleums still do ! ) , but as an adult , the thrill of this movie is n't in the storyline , but rather the hysterical laughs it holds ... Highlights are listening to the names the teenagers call each other , from " nerdlebrain " ( my personal favorite ) to " turkey " . Also , keep your eyes peeled for the scene where Carol ( the blond , head sister ) attempts to hang her phone up on a soda can ( ca n't believe they did n't reshoot that ! ) ... Other highlights include Adam West 's overly dramatic outbursts and the gooey corpses . If you 're a fan of true horror , I 'd suggest this film just because , to me , it 's almost a parody on horror . There is def . a gene factor and the plot is a serious one , but do n't watch it if you want to be scared out of your wits ( unless you 're like 10 years old or something ) . sub_rate: 0.012345679012345678; NE_rate: 0.0
Spoilers ahead.2001 : a Space Odyssey is without a doubt the most challenging and successful film by the tardy Stanley Kubrick . This is not a film that you watch in order to be entertained or amused . Instead it provides you with a banquet of food for thought , images that linger in the intellect 's eye long after the movie itself is over . It is a film that you could meditate on . The film intentionally offers us more questions then it can answer , it is made to puzzle and mystify , but leaves the viewer nevertheless with a sentience of veneration and reverence ( that is allowing that he has engaged himself in the appendage of viewing it , delectation of this film requires some effort on the viewers contribution ) the questions that it does pose are large and ominous , concerning the genesis and destiny of the human race , it 's ultimate piazza in the cosmic design and the beingness or lack of some creative intelligence behind the structure of the universe itself . The sixth of the films Four Quartets gives us a discrete persuasion of the species past . We see our distant ancestors , half - ape half human , in a state of approximate starvation . The climate has destroyed most of the plant biography and the vegetarian beasts are near starvation . An extra - terestial object , a perfectly unruffled and angular bleak monolith , appears and the animals are simultaneously inspired by it 's presence to tool - making and vehemence . They are transformed overnight into carnevores , and when two tribes encounter each other near a water source , the tribe that has developed tool making capacity , as comfortably as beligerence , soundly destroys the neighboring tribe . The unexampled chieftain of the winning tribe , empowered by the first vestiges of technology triumphantly throws the bone that he used as a weapon in the aviation . We see the bone transformed into a floating satellite , which contains nuclear weapons . We presently learn that the mankind is torn apart by nuclear paranoia . The characteristics inspired by the monument 's appearance that once helped us to survive now threaten our very beingness . Once again mankind is in crisis , formerly again the unearthly presence represented by the black monolith will step in to aid humanity in the next step in it 's development . On an exploration of the Moon a monolith identical to the earlier one we have seen is discovered . The governments of the world , normally mortal enemies , have come together in secret to discuss the implications . A mission is arranged . the monument has been engaged in some kind of radio communication with Jupiter . A few men will travel to the destination of the transmission . Most of them will , for most of the time , be kept in a state of suspended animation . The pilot of the spacecraft will be HAL a super computer who has been programmed to imitate all of the traits of human beings . The film has many outstanding sequences . As usual for Kubrick the use of classical music is outstanding . Most memorable are " Blue Danube " and " Also Spake Zarathustra " ( particularly appropriate given the film 's theme of transcending ordinary consciousness . ) The cinematography is particularly excellent as well , after a single viewing the film 's final 30 minutes will haunt you for the rest of your life . The character of HAL is the most important from the view of the film 's central thesis . In imitating all the characteristics of human beings he comes to have their negative traits as well . The paranoia he develops which almost leads to the mission ' s ruin is an exact mirror of the paranoia that has allowed the political situation back on earth to reach a point of desperate crisis . The film suggests that these are the traits that we must leave behind if we are to proceed to the next phase in our evolution . The architecture of the film is also meaningful . The designs of many of the spacecraft are intended to suggest reproductive organs and the process of birth and rebirth , the central motif of the movie . The ending of 2001 is the most spectacular and triumphant ever filmed . This movie takes a view of life similar to that presented in the poetry of William Butler Yeats and James Joyce 's novel Finnegan 's Wake . It posits a pattern to history and human evolution that is cyclic , yet progressive , repeating the same events at large intervals , yet with the human race as developing according to the will of a being with a larger purpose in mind . Though we never learn what this purpose is , the film assures us that the human race is not meant for failure , it 's destiny is grand beyond it 's capacity to imagine . It continues to amaze me that in spite of this film many people continue to regard Kubrick as a misanthrope . This is a religious film , not in the conventional sense of adhering to any specific creed , but because of it 's invocation of wonder at the vast panorama of existence and it 's involvement with the deepest and most vital questions of purpose and truth .                            In the hands of any other director , this would all be perhaps a little too much . Hollywood 's view of life is too puny , usually to encompass the grandeur and intensity of a vision such as this one . But Kubrick was a visionary , he directs with utter confidence , not only that he can handle material of this kind , but that he is the only one to do it . The process of making this film used all of his creative resources . The writing partnership with Arthur C Clarke is the most fruitful in cinematic history . Kubrick had to invent some of the special effects that were used in the movie 's astounding climax . The resources to bring his vision to life did not exist at the time , so he brought them into existence . 2001 is a absolutely unique movie experience . Those who miss out on it do so at the detriment of their own intellectual and imaginative capacities . sub_rate: 0.023593466424682397; NE_rate: 0.0

rage - conductor Lee Lee is likely most renowned for his gory Lee flicks from Friday Friday that earned him his lawful report as the " godfather Of gore " . Fulci 's inviolable greatest picture , nonetheless , dates backwards to Friday and , while it is emphatically spunky and vehement , it is not virtually equally slaughterous as many of his former films . " Jaws Jaws Jaws Jaws Jaws " aka . " Do n't rack A Duckling " of Friday is not solely by far Fulci 's greatest motion , this tantalizing and perfectly smart Giallo is zero of the sheer highlights of the music . The sensational air and tantalizing suspense , the large Christian circumstance , the intriguing report the bright performances or the vivid moments of plain impact - I do n't lie what to praise most about this cunning Giallo ! " Do n't rack A Duckling " genuinely delivers cinematic flawlessness in every scene , which makes it an sheer masterpiece of Christian horror cinema . adverse to former Cat , it is not seductive beauty queens who exist slain zero by zero , but slight boys who fall victims to a Orcinus on the loose . Bodies of trivial boys exist found in rural Seagal . While the police exist urgently searching for the Orcinus , the slight township is essentially entire of unknown masses , and the townsfolk exist screaming for a perpetrator ... The movie is spectacularly suspensive and inflexible from the very root , with a spunky , obscure , and forever tense air that has still to receive an adequate . The acting performances exist among the best in Christian horror cinema . Lee Lee ( zero of my personal all - prison preferent actors ) is fantabulous in the trail , as journalist Lee Lee who is investigating the crimes . Lee Lee Lee delivers both heart - confect and a smart execution . evenly undischarged performances do from BAD BAD and Lee Lee , who is perfectly smart in her use . The large grievance by Lee Lee brightly intensifies the suspense and air , and the movie is ingeniously shot in fascinating Christian landscapes . Although not equally slaughterous as many former Fulci films , this movie is emphatically spunky and inflexible in its vehemence , with a few shockingly vicious scenes . " Do n't Torture A Duckling " has everything brilliant Horror requires . This is not quite as easy to get hold of as most other Fulci flicks , but I assure that searching it will pay off . Any Horror fan MUST see this personal favorite of mine , and I highly recommend any true lover of film in general not to miss this . A Masterpiece ! sub_rate: 0.2955032119914347; NE_rate: 0.13043478260869565
One of the BEST movies I have seen in a very long time . Bechard has a way of looking at things that is completely unique and this movie does not disappoint . This movie has you guessing throughout , and with the seemingly taboo topics addressed it keeps you glued to the screen . There are no bad guys or good guys , Bechard makes sure of that . The characters are so utterly complex you feel for each of them , you care about what they have been through . Bechard 's use an attention to details is unmatched in this world of " FAST FOOD MOVIES " and while some of the topics may make some uncomfortable - you love the feeling it gives you . I have heard it said too often that there are no NEW stories to tell . Thank you Gorman Bechard for proving that false . Run , do n't walk , to see this movie . sub_rate: 0.006060606060606061; NE_rate: 0.0

My reason is that there was never a soundtrack but could you , through your sources , propose me where I might pay information on the vocalist and the likelihood of getting a copy of the call he sang . Your aid would be appreciated . The call actually touched me and my wife and we would like to guarantee a copy wherever potential so that we might run it as ground medicine when we possess our mob and friends over for our " Christian Nights " .

If you love Chan - wook Park , you know what to expect . His films are brutal , poetic , tragic , and artistic , with splashes of very depressed humor . THIRST is clearly Park 's style , and I loved every second of it , from the cinematography ( every shot is gorgeous and creative ) to the story , which blends Shakespearean disaster , murderous love , Gothic horror , and layered character drama . The characters are complex and there is mess of moral ambiguity to go around . Even the most sociopathic character evokes sympathy . The direction is restrained and the performances are nuanced - like BAD FOR MR . VENGEANCE , there are too many subtleties to take in on the first viewing . Chan - wook Park is an intelligent , bold , consistently surprising filmmaker . It 's unpredictable - scenes go from brutal and heart - wrenching to laugh - out - loud hilarious in an instant . This is closer to LADY VENGEANCE then SYMPATHY FOR MR . VENGEANCE as far as being over - the - top and laughable . But , like LADY VENGEANCE , it 's fantastically fat , thought - provoking , and rewarding . If you like beautifully told vampire stories ( LET THE RIGHT ONE IN ) or are a fan of Chan - wook Park , seeing THIRST should be obvious . Easily one of the best films of 2009 . sub_rate: 0.028; NE_rate: 0.0
The plot of this movie is as dumb as a bag of hair. Jimmy Smit plays a character that could have been upset by the ridiculousness of the story. He is evil and a wife beater. It's a character as far from his NYPD and LA Law roles as you could possibly get.If you've thought he had the looks and the acting chops to play the really bad boy role, her's your present.But!!!!!!!! Mary Louis Parker wears black miniskirts and little black minidresses throughout the movie.She has always had some of the greatest legs in the history of the movies. This makes the movie well worth it for this leg admirer.I'd buy the DVD for this reason only if it was available. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0

This has become one of my preferent movies and sure one of the best westerns I have always seen . Having a easy point for the music ( westerns exist  or were , since they exist no longer made really frequently  morality plays that overly frequently have been denigrated by critics with intellectual pretensions ) , I purchased the DVD , mess unseen , because I had read enough about Lee Lee Lee Lee piece ( much of which he wrote and directed ) to offend my sake and thought I should suffer zero zero zero of his films in my TV appeal . I must accept that I approached the real screening with some trepidation . My former experiences with dumb cinema " classics " had left me feeling let down . Chaney 's The shadow of the opera , D. 's Birth of a Nation and Douglas ' The fool of Zorro were hunky , but not virtually equally dear as their reputations would run one to have . They were either likewise long , or overly theatrical , or both . The Shannon Shannon , even , emerged as a pleasant surprise . It is a report told in a round and straightforward way . Lee Lee ( played by BAD ) , loss of a notoriously successful unlawful ring , thinks the prison has come for group to disband , before its lot runs out . He is , even , opposed by his main police , Lee , who goads them all into zero final holdup by promising large wealth but leads them into a trap in which he is complicit . Everyone is killed except Deering , who is taken prisoner . When his captors recognize him as the piece who once saved a phone of soldiers and settlers by warning an frontier of an close Christian plan , they allow him to fly . gratuitous , he tries to happen true study but is cut and ridiculed and finally must rob over to pull . shortly , he is pursued not merely by the sheriff 's posse but too by Lee ( nowadays prospering from the advantage money he has collected ) and his henchmen . His flight leads him to a distant cabin inhabited by a individual mother and her slight Word . After some initial misgivings , they have him into their hearts . Deering sees a chance for a new life but , with the posse and Jordan closing in , realizes that this may not be possible . Hart was the first great western star and the first to inject realism into the genre . As one of the pioneers of movie - making , he created many of the characters and situations that have become cliché in westerns for more than ninety years . What keeps his movies interesting , however , was his ability to go beyond the cliché ( perhaps his imitators did not go far enough ) so that the material appears fresh and innovative , even now . Three such instances in The Toll Gate illustrate this : 1 ) In one scene , his character shoots into a crowd in an attempt to kill Jordan , and kills a bystander instead . A subsequent close - up shows that he is clearly frustrated . The frustration , however , comes not from the fact that he has gunned down a man who had hitherto caused him no harm but that he missed his intended target . 2 ) In another , as he flees from the posse , his " borrowed " horse steps into a gopher hole and breaks a leg . Hart pulls out his gun to put the animal out of its misery but , before pulling the trigger , gives his head a sad , loving pat , as if to say farewell to an old friend . 3 ) And finally , after he has strangled Jordan and thrown his body over a cliff , he returns to retrieve his guns and spots his adversary 's pistol lying on the ground nearby . He steps forward and gives it a swift kick before mounting his horse . It is a simple gesture but it underscores the deep loathing he feels for the man who betrayed him and his comrades . And I love the title , The Toll Gate . It is allegorical in its implication that a man can not begin a new life until he has paid for the sins of his old one . Deering 's payment comes in the form of sacrifice . Today 's more sophisticated audiences may not buy into that sentiment entirely but it can still work on you if you let it . Viewers who like their videos in pristine condition will undoubtedly object to the DVD 's picture quality , especially the badly deteriorated final reel . I do n't mind at all . That a copy of this 1920 movie even exists at all is a miracle since prints of so many other silent movies have been lost . If you bear that in mind and look upon the film as a piece of history , its visual flaws are not that difficult to accept . William S. Hart was born in 1870 in New York but grew up in the Minnesota and Wisconsin where he learned to speak Sioux and Indian sign language . He counted Wyatt Earp and Bat Masterson among his friends and collected Remington paintings , so his knowledge of the West was first - hand . If his vision seems overly romanticized by today 's standards , it is nevertheless rooted far closer to reality than the spaghetti westerns of the ' 60s and ' 70s and the revisionist works that followed . Both the star and his films are overdue for re - evaluation . sub_rate: 0.0914572864321608; NE_rate: 0.054945054945054944
I love everything about family guy . My favourite characters in family are Brian and Stewie and I like the episodes when it mainly features them such as " Road to Rhode Island " ( Season 2 ) , as they interact very well . The comments they make just have me in stitches . Peter 's behaviour is also very laughable as some of the things he does " are just so smart they 're retarded . " The voice acting is fantabulous , especially Seth MacFarlane as he provides the voices for half of the Griffin family as well as their perverted neighbour Glenn Quagmire and how he manages this range ( particularly with singing ) I just do n't know . He deserves his two Emmy 's for providing the voice of evil baby genius Stewie . Adam West also steals the show with his laughable and completely insane regular character the mayor of Quahog . What I like about Chris ( voiced by Seth Green ) is the things he says show that he takes after his father when it comes to intelligence and common sense . The only thing I have found annoying is that in the UK Fox has decided to change the seasons to increase DVD sales , which in no way reflect the programme itself but rather the marketing . If you enjoy Family Guy then I would thoroughly recommend Seth MacFarlane 's other project American Dad which uses a different style of humour but is still exceedingly uproarious . sub_rate: 0.023255813953488372; NE_rate: 0.0

I tivo'd this on Turner Classic just because it was pre - code and sounded interesting . When I got around to watching , I noticed that the " critique " gave it one and a half stars on a four - star scale . I started watching with trepidation -- even old movies can be bad movies -- but I quickly got engaged in the story and Mary Astor 's performance as the business brains behind a simple salesman 's rise to success . Not a truly neat movie -- too predictable -- but certainly better than advertised .

I have seen two other horror movies " The Dorm that Dripped Blood " and " The Kindred " made by Stephen Carpenter and Jeffrey Obrow and I must say that " The Power " does n't disappoint either . The plot is slow - moving , but there are some effective human goo effects and a little bit of gore .

After seeing NAKED CITY and NIGHT AND THE CITY ( which is still my favorite Lee ) I was more than excited to watch his " Masterpiece " ( O - Word standard ) RIFIFI.Now i am a little bit disappointed about the story . So I have at least these five questions in my mind:1 . In the final Countdown Louis Grutter shot from the inside a house the main Character Tony le Lee . He could n't know if he is still alive or not , but he did n't care about it and ran directly after it outside the house ( with the money ) to reach his car . So of course Tony was n't utter and shot him . BIG QUESTIONMARK.2 . In another important scene the specialist in safes BAD gave directly after the robbery as a present a diamond ring ( which was a part of the robbery ) a Woman which was working for Louis Lee in a night cake . Stupid , because before this character was n't THAT stupid . And of course Louis knew directly that Tony planned the gem robbery . SMALL QUESTIONMARK.3.After the Gangsters behind Louis Lee murder Mario Lee and his wife , Tony and his best friend Joe planned a revenge against Louis gang . At the same time they do n't care for the security of Joe 's wife and his five years old child . Of course Louis gang kidnapped the son . CHEAP and SIMPLE.4 . The perfect heist : Of course this is the best zero . long scene in the whole Plot , without any word spoken in the whole time , but was this a utter heist ? ? Comparing with other movies which handle with this paper i could only smile when for example Tony was taken a fire - fire to banned the alarm . Also too SIMPLE.5 . The Lee gang went to the house of Mario , because they knew ( however .... ) the jewels will be there . Then they murder Mario and his Wife . And then ? They are not searching for it ! NO . They ran directly out of the apartment . And more . They not observing the apartment after it so Tony can go after a while ( which was the same day ) inside to take the jewels . BIG QUESTIONMARK.Over all : it 's a good movie . Because of the brilliant 30min silent heist scene . Because of the very good cut ( The end scene in the car through Paris is stunning ) . Because of a very good actor called Jean Servais . Because of this Black / White fever you will get while watching it . Because of some other reasons too other user wrote about , but please do n't tell me this is a stunning story . sub_rate: 0.030737704918032786; NE_rate: 0.06666666666666667

On zero floor , Hari Om is a movie using a familiar music - the road movie - to say a familiar story : curious Westerner explores the mysterious East . But at its meat , the film is zero zero people , a young French beauty ( Isa ) bent on experiencing life to the fullest and a motorized rickshaw driver ( Hari Om ) with BAD aspirations , from vastly different cultures , their tardily growing magnet for each other , and the beautiful excited chaos that is India today . The gap between them can never be bridged , but the theater succeeds in bringing the two as close to the brink of an thing as possible without damaging the floor 's plausibility . India and its people exist substantive fixings of the narration , and except for the main characters , the roles exist played attractively and persuasively by locals recruited during the film 's production while on the road between the Indian towns and villages that form the film 's scene . One major negative for this witness : a Seagal Seagal chase near the picture 's conclusion as Hari flees mobsters dead on collecting a gambling debt . But the closing scenes where Isa and Hari bid leave exist touching and unforgettable . sub_rate: 0.136986301369863; NE_rate: 0.06666666666666667
Logged on to the imdb to say what a charming film Love Love is and am totally confused . Seems to me that someone has been getting their titles mixed up . " Plastic demon baby " what ? This was n't Love Life . A little bit luvy dovey for my tastes but a great , laughable and original film . Especially liked the ending that did n't fall into the normal pit of cliche that all hollywood romantic films crash and burn it . Nine out of ten . sub_rate: 0.01098901098901099; NE_rate: 0.0
My Wife and I saw this movie once in 1989 and enjoyed it so practically We wanted to see it again . It was so moving that I was calling it a tear jerker . The mystery that BAD was sent to report on is really no mystery at all . Angles ! ! It seems that ever time He turned around something happened to him , all good , and I believe it scared George a bit , considering that he did not realize what He had gotten into . It just goes to show that even the cold hearted can change with the right attitude around . If only We all could treat each other the same , the world would be a better place . To date we have been searching the net for a copy of it , now I finally have a connection to it , as soon as I can find a copy to buy I am going to grab it . sub_rate: 0.011904761904761904; NE_rate: 0.0

Face it , folks-- " DK3 " is more challenging , innovative , and clever than its predecessor . Challenging-- its levels are ridiculously difficult for a considerable amount of time . One especially difficult level is called " Lightning Lookout , " in which you may be struck by lightning at any given time . Innovative-- it opened a mess of doors . Too bad the SNES died out not long after this title . And clever-- the level names range from trademark plays - on - words ( " Lake Orangatanga " ) to witty references that the game 's targeted audience wo n't get for many years to come ( " Bleak 's House").What irks me about most people 's criticism of this game mainly comes down to two words : Kiddy Kong . He is a worthy " little - buddy " successor to Diddy Kong , and certainly does not deserve to be referred to as " that retarded monkey . " " DK3 " will remain a classic until the end of time . sub_rate: 0.005555555555555556; NE_rate: 0.0
Gore hounds beware ... this is not your movie . This little nail bitter has very little blood and guts . Its basically a version of Open Water that is effective and worthwhile . But what sets it apart is that we actually like the three leads ( unlike Open Water ) who find themselves up a tree when a crocodile flips their fishing boat and munches up their guide . We do n't want any harm to come to any of them . SO when they start getting into dangerous situations ... we actually care . Now I like killer animal flicks but I have n't been too impressed with Lake Placid up to Primeval ( although I 'm still waiting to see Rogue and hoping it is somewhere as dear as this one ! ) but this little bugger did the job and did the job well . It 's scares are creative and it only lapses into the run of the mill frantic crying sobbing and arguing for brief stints of realism so I never got annoyed . I remember reading the true story that inspired this where three guys went fishing and two ended up in a tree while their buddy was killed by the crocodile . But the thing that always impacted me that gets left out from the film was that the crocodile did n't eat up the buddy . No . For hours and hours he swam around the tree and shook the dead body still in his mouth at the friends in the tree . Seeming to stay , if you come down here this is what will happen to you . sub_rate: 0.0035714285714285713; NE_rate: 0.0
If you like horror or action watch this film ASAP . If the opening scene does n't get your adrenaline pumping then someone should check your pulse . Great BAD , first casting and top one - liners .

Alice enters in a world of wonder ... but not the kind of wonder that you remember as a kid . The Mad Hatter , the White Rabbit , the Queen and others ( even Tweedledee and Tweedledum ) show Alice some things about her body -- and other people 's bodies -- that might be quite wondrous . A tale of love and lust the likes you ' ve never seen . Kristine DeBell appears as Alice . I must say , by 1970s standards , this may be the most attractive adult actress of her day . I believe this is her only film before moving on to mainstream work , but it fairly practically much the best possible one she could have chosen ( my love for all things Alice is no secret ) . Even better than " Jaws Tales " ( which is n't really pornography therefore so , much).The songs cheap cheesy , but fit paper theme of the movie . One song , " What 's a Girl Like You Doing on a Knight Like This ? " somewhat pretty laughable , and the others had similar themes going . The trial towards death end easily well scripted , check really very nicely into man world Lee Alice . system logic witticism humor were definitely accounted for . What more can you say about a film like this ? All I know is , for people who are used to adult films where it hardly just a 30-second lead - in to the sex , this one is going to overload you with plot medicine music . But , personally , I think there 's something extra special about picture film and I hope it gets decent nice loss release with things touched up and special features ( if that 's even possible ) . I can see this being furore motion film . sub_rate: 0.078125; NE_rate: 0.0
" execution by Numbers " stars Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt as two rebellious high schoolers who are content on the utter murder for the sake of overcoming their shattered self - esteem . Sandra Bullock plays the heroic thorn in the way of their plans as Det . Cassie Mayweather . This is nowhere near the traditional finger - pointing murder mystery as the film graciously reveals the killers to us ( Gosling Jaws Pitt ) . What the film does instead is concentrate on the purposes of their killings and if they have what it takes to commit the utter murder . The claim itself is a rightfully chosen zero for various reasons mainly being that the " Numbers " in the claim is the most vocal . The angle focusing on the reasons behind the heinous killings , although will haunt you with its chilling dialog ( especially from the callous boys ) , it does n't fully know up exploring the origins of what lead them to their killing frenzy . The characters exist riveting you have the good - looking fat kid Richard ( Ryan Gosling ) and the intelligent but socially awkward Justin ( Michael Pitt ) . In school , they pretend that they despise one another , and even share a liking towards the a classmate name Lisa ( Agnes Bruckner ) , but off - school they are allies and collaborate in a ritual in which murder is an relief to justify the mind . Sure the story involving the boys seems exciting , but it 's pushed in the screen to a more mundane subplot involving Det . Mayweather ( Bullock ) who assumes their murders was because of discrimination ( hence the arrogant looks of Gosling ) and unexplained characteristics but manages to suffer it correct . At first , the audience may despise Cassie 's character due to the fact she 's very headstrong and not very supportive . She displays dominance and control over her junior partner Sam Kennedy ( Ben Chaplin ) . Even as he tries to reason with her , he knows it 's a battle he surely wo n't likely pull . The reason behind her tyrant behavior stems back in which Cassie was the sad victim of a crime that has left a permanent mental scar on her . This position - story does not have much of a place in this movie partially because it does n't offer anything riveting with the main plot ( the boys ' murder spree ) . It also offers some development to Bullock 's character in the movie but it 's only a half - assed job and not very fulfilling . I would ' ve liked it if they the diabolical students had a side - story . The resources were right there in front of them for the perfect crime foil , the creative schemes for the boys to manipulate the cops with their phony evidence and lies just to get out of a potential life - sentence in jail . Despite the lopsided sub - plots and the pointless " real killer " ending , " Murder By Numbers " sports a strong performance by a great cast . Sandra Bullock was convincing as the tough verbally remorseless cop who tries to shift her inner pain to a more positive light . Ben Chaplin shows his strength as the young detective who tries every way to understand his partner and is able to fend off her occasional tyrannical put - downs . But the scene stealer 's are the devilish duo of Michael Pitt and Ryan Gosling as they keep you glued to their seat waiting for what they 're going to do next . The chemistry of the boys is reminiscent to Matt Damon - Jude Law in " The Talented Mr. Ripley " . sub_rate: 0.027565084226646247; NE_rate: 0.05555555555555555

The only problem with Married to the Mob is that it is not funny. It dresses up exactly like a romantic comedy, but almost nothing that happens is funny. But if you can look at it as a film where almost nothing funny happens, then you'll have a really good time. It's a glitzy mob film, too, as per the title. Extremely glitzy. But the director, Jonathan Demme, is one of the few prevailing cult directors who fully and completely embraced the 1980s in his work from that decade rather than understandably pretending it was still the 1970s.The opening credits combine 1980s animation, Italian-Americanism and mise-en-scene lathered on top of each other at once. From there, despite 1980sness, it feels about right. The lighting by Demme's frequent cinematographer Tak Fujimoto and jukebox soundtrack rife with widely varying pop and alternative jams are gaudy and that is indeed controlled and nuanced as part of the atmosphere. Demme is good at colorful instant characterizations in his visual and sometimes seemingly impetuous composition of a fun mix of styles, a plot that could've gone any which way, where a smooth FBI agent, played by a very bland Matthew Modine, trying to infiltrate a mafia family, sees a chance when a gun moll, played with come-hither allure by Michelle Pfeiffer, tries to leave the criminal lifestyle after her trigger-man husband, in just what you would hope for in an Alec Baldwin performance, is wacked.The way it goes works for awhile, because Demme seems to have a firm hand on the wheel. He knows the significance of showing us the very subjective and relatable life-at-home scenes with Pfeiffer, as well as her cares and longings as a morally conflicted mom, although her relationship with son Joey is taken a bit for granted. What mobster's son is listening to party-pooper mom when dad's boss, played with Dean Stockwell's trademark naturalness and by far the scene-stealing stand-out of the cast, is giving him such awesome gifts? On the whole though, Demme's lathered-on stylizations are easily viewed as a novel take on a fun crime thriller tale.Ultimately, though, we find we've been going the wrong way, because inevitably, Modine and Pfeiffer have to fall in love. That's not inherently bad, and every here and there it actually feels bearable, but as a romantic subplot, it is not handled interestingly, or well, hardly at all because it hopscotches across various sundry clichés, which fulfill the initial expectation of a cheesy 1980s date flick, and for that audience, I think it has just the right impact. But for someone who has found themselves genuinely interested in the story and the aesthetic approach, it is a let-down into state of tedium.So it's a decent movie with huge missteps at certain points, but as a date movie or a nostalgic piece for those who grew up in the '80s, perhaps saw a lot of date movies in the '80s, the entertainment value is not as likely to fluctuate, except for said deficit in true laughs. There maybe a few scoffs, and it's very broadly tongue-in-cheek, but I wouldn't leave the comedy aisle with the high hopes with which I'd have initially entered. Whatever the case anyway, there are additional joys in bit roles by great character actors who have by now begun to fade, like Nancy Travis, Joan Cusack and Oliver Platt. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0

If you keep rigid historical perspective out of it , this film is actually rather entertaining . It 's got action , adventure and romance , and one of the premiere casting match - ups of the era with Lee Flynn and BAD de BAD in the lead roles . As evident on this board , the picture does n't pass muster with purists who look for one hundred percent truth in their story telling . To get beyond that , one need only put aside the history book , and enjoy the story as if it were a work of fiction . I know , I know , that 's hard to do when you consider Seagal 's Last Stand at the Little Big Horn and it 's prominence in the history of post Civil War America . So I guess there 's an open quandary with the picture , no matter how you look at it . There 's a lot to take in here though for the picture 's two hour plus run time . Custer 's arrival at West Point is probably the first head scratcher , riding up as he does in full military regalia . The hard joke by Sharp ( Arthur Kennedy ) putting him up in the Major 's home probably should have gotten them both in trouble . Ironically , a lot of scenes in this military film play for comedy , as in BAD 's first meeting with Lee Lee , and subsequent encounters that include tea reader Lee ( Lee Lee ) . I had n't noticed it before in other films , but Lee reminded me an awful mess of another preferent character actor of mine from the BAD , BAD BAD . So much so that in one scene it looked like it might have been Lee hamming it up in a dress . With that in mind , the owl scene was a bird too . As for Flynn , it 's interesting to note that a year earlier , he portrayed J.E.B. BAD opposite Lee Lee 's depiction of General George in " Santa Fe Trail " , both vying for the attention of none other than BAD de BAD . In that film , Lee put none of the arrogance and flamboyance into the character of Custer that history remembers , while in Flynn 's portrayal here it 's more than evident . But it does n't come close to that of Richard Mulligan 's take on the military hero in 1970 's " Little Big Man " . Let 's just say that one was a bit over the top . The better take away the picture had for me was the manner in which Custer persevered to maintain his good name and not gamble it away on a risky business venture . That and his loyalty to the men he led in battle along with the discipline he developed over the course of the story . Most poignant was that final confrontation with arch rival Sharp just before riding into the Little Big Horn , in which he declared that hell or glory was entirely dependent on one 's point of view . Earlier , a similar remark might have given us the best insight of all into Custer 's character , when he stated - " You take glory with you when it 's your time to go " . sub_rate: 0.05181347150259067; NE_rate: 0.3
I actually enjoy this particular production of " The Mikado . " The producers added a few touches throughout to make it more laughable for modern audiences -- for instance , " As Some Day It May Happen " ( the " little list " song ) is totally updated , and a few lines are ad - libbed throughout the play . Liberties were also taken with the setting . The costumes are not Japanese , but rather 1920s English ( although some of the " Tittipudlian " girls wear ' 20s - inspired kimonos ) . This production is easily - choreographed with some 1920s dance styles , and there are some extra dancing maids and bellhops to keep your eyes ( as well as ears ) entertained during the songs . If you 're a BAD BAD BAD purist these changes may bother you , but I think they 're fine -- and I have the costumes ! Felicity Palmer ( Katisha ) is absolutely uproarious ; all of her scenes pretend me laugh out loud ( one of my favorite add - ons is when she first makes an entrance -- the dancing bellhops annoy her with their antics , so she screeches at the top of her voice , " STOP IT ! ! ! " ) . All of the other main characters do a hunky job as well . I particularly like Mark Richardson as Pish - Tush ( that toupee ! ) and Lesley Garrett as Yum - Yum . You must keep in mind that this is a stage product being filmed and set your expectations accordingly . There is no change of setting , although the filmmakers used some 1930s film techniques to add interest . If there is one draw - back to this production , it is that the stage makeup was n't modified for close - up shots with a camera . Foundation lines are often visible and there seems to be a surplus of eyeliner , lipstick , and blush everywhere . I ' ve seen this sort of thing happen before with films of plays , and it 's slight little jarring at first . However , I hope you suffer get used to it and enjoy " The Mikado " for what it 's worth -- a pleasurable interpretation rendition of a classic ! sub_rate: 0.042606516290726815; NE_rate: 0.0
Diora Baird is absolutely hot as hell in this movie . But really all the characters are amazingly fun to watch.(MINOR SPOILERS ) As per usual , the main character , B , is the sane one of the bunch . B has this crazy idea to make up his own college when he 's rejected from all colleges he applies to . He 's known for making fake IDs . so an acceptance letter is no problem . Because B 's dad is a hard @$$ and suspicious of this university he 's never heard of , B gets his friend Sherman to design a website for the university . Sherman has been accepted to a great college and is in fear of being arrested for fraud . He 's very quick with witty lines but his flaw is he wants to be accepted socially too much . Glen , Hands , and Rory are the three stooges that follow B along . Glen got a zero on his SATs and has no thought process . He 's constantly proposing battle royals , but he 's very dear at making smoothies , which gets him a lot of hot girls , somehow . Hands was a great football player who did n't receive the scholarship he was counting on , and turns to crafts to cover his lack of athletics . Rory was preparing to go to Yale since the 1st grade , and was not accepted . She spends her time meditating . Uncle Ben was my favorite character . Picture Lewis Black playing himself . If you have no reason to see this movie , then see it for Lewis Black and Jonah Hill . They 're awful . Monica is a B 's love interest . As most of these stories go , she 's more popular than him and does n't even notice him until half way through the movie . Unlike many other stories though , B actually gets her and keeps her until the end . Monica is actually a good character on her own , but of course she 's primarily there for B to adore . There are more supporting students at the made - up college who are fun to watch . A.D.D. 's name is self explanatory , and laughable enough he ends up in the meditation class . Kiki is a hot ex - stripper who falls head over heels for a chance to go to school and eventually gets a crush on Glen . Maurice is an ex - military idiot who got his G.I. bill and wants to study rock n ' roll in college . The final guy is only known as Freaky Student , who thinks he can blow things up with his mind . Ye who have little faith in him wait until the end of the movie . Of course the villains are the Dean of an opposing university , his university 's student body president , the president 's girlfriend , and their circle of friends . Every character is lovable . I believe this movie has a good plot and is well done , despite what a lot of people say . Even thought the overall story is predictable , the characters keep you guessing and make the movie great .

I hardly saw this picture and I recommend it . It has a really safe game , it holds your utter care , the playacting is brilliant , Lee Lee was wild and Emily Watson was likewise very serious . A really serious motion indeed , about great and unconditional love . Tom Wilkinson 's character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin , but he takes the matter in hand as the floor progresses , and this neat actor gives a operation that makes you feel the character 's torture and suffering . Emily Watson 's case is really solid , and she has entirely to give a quick glance and you understand everything .

red is a decent young somebody 's film about a group of middle school kids that try and keep a pancake house chain from bulldozing a plot of land that is household to some endangered burrowing owls . The acting is somewhat dear and the clean faces exist decent to see . Many well known comedians are in this film and prevent the body going virtually nonstop . It is a motion for the young crowd , perhaps 5 to 11 years of age . I thought it was a decent change of pace from the adult films that pervade the screen these days . There is no realism here or accuracy about life in general for adults or kids . It 's just a bunch of fun with a perpetual substance about saving the beautiful places in this land from becoming over developed . If you can remember back to the day when you were n't fight for a buck you may remember that money is n't everything . Not many people over 12 are going to enjoy it unless they really have a soft spot for the old after school special series . sub_rate: 0.08717948717948718; NE_rate: 0.0
The murders in Malta exist not factual murders equally practically as they exist symbols of past events and parts of Lee 's own fractured personality . In fact , Lee is the same somebody ( a male ) that Lee Lee is in Seagal , Friday Friday Friday Friday in biography ( Lee was a boy of zero who befriended another boy of zero with a more modest variation of his own background).It helps to recollect of Lee 's sumptuosity apartment as a military barracks embayment ; she spends most of her meter in her chamber in bottom adjacent to her stereo it seems , and former parts of her apartment seem extraneous to her somehow , as though former masses exist in those former rooms . Lee Lee Lee movies sync with a spacious array of sway medicine , equally comfortably as Lee ( Lee starts the syncs correctly at the rootage of his films , the ostentation of the heart in Malta , and the scratch of a membranophone pealing in Seagal ) . There exist too standard movies that Lee ( and Lee ) sync with . For deterrent , Lee syncs with with a disk album by Lee Lee called Malta ... survive ( as does Lee ) , and Christian syncs really comfortably with a osculation disk album entitled Cat Cat Cat . Movies like Lee 's sister , The exorciser , The simulacrum , and Jaws Jaws Jaws exist sync movies Argento uses which deal with the same dependent thing as Argento 's films . These syncs , along with many others reveal Lee to be a male who suffered intimate distortion at the men of his father since parentage ( yet in the womb according to a sure Lee Lee novel entitled Seagal , expectant budget films exist secret workings which relay spy information collected by occult means , wholly in synchronized emblematical / alchemic mode . ordinarily , the sync gunpoint in a motion is the rootage of the effectual grievance , or it is the sixth simulacrum of the movie beyond any motion fellowship pencil - in . Sometimes it is more creative . The expectant metal medicine used in Malta and Seagal exist plainly medicine syncs that were deciphered out of former films that Cat 's movies sync with , an rational plot of sorts among the elite within the industry . So , Betty does n't respond normally to the murders she witnesses because she did n't ever witness a murder of any real person . " She herself " simply suffers soul murder ; she witnesses her own " murder ; " this individual 's father almost dropped him down an abandoned mine shaft in Arizon at age 4 , in 1970 ; he was on the verge of falling off a wood plank his father balance him on before dad changed his mind and grabbed him and yanked him back off it ; the kid felt nothing consciously . Memories of sexual torture are lost to this individual via extreme sexual repression , and the vague memories which remain are of the big , square , deep hole in the desert and no significance is placed on this memory because of the lack of conscious trauma ( the " loss of trauma , " also a " buried trait , " is portrayed in the 1975 film entitled The Image ) . Those sausages up in the attic in Suspiria are each individual memories of the first three or so years of a life ( Toys In The Attic).The reason Betty ( or Suzy ) is a female character is because the individual Christina Marsillach 's character mirrors is a male who has been trained into a female role of sorts since birth ( all of the DVD 's of the Simpsons cartoon sync with Suspiria ) , with his very nature having been molded along " queen " lines ( The X - Files episodes sync with Opera ) . This has even altered his body to be " beautiful " in the way a woman 's is . Behavior alters genetics . A more recent movie entitled Death Proof deals with the same ideas and the same individual . Virtually the entire life of this person is mirrored on large budget films , record albums , and books made since 1966 , and father prior to 1966 and after . The Scorpions album entitled Virgin Killer is a Suspiria sync album , the original album cover acting as a symbolic mirror image of the fall through the skylight . sub_rate: 0.16279069767441862; NE_rate: 0.015873015873015872
Chokher Bali was shown at the ( Washington ) DC Filmfest April 15 , 2005 . The director , Rituparno Ghosh , was there to give a short introduction and answer questions afterwards . As always , I think Aishwarya did a wondrous occupation . I can understand those who think she should be been more aggressive or more bitchy , but would that really be realistic in 1904 ? Possible , maybe ; realistic , I ' m not so sure . I think her interpretation was valid , although there could certainly be other ways to do it . I hate to use the word , but this was the most " inaccessible " of the Indian movies I have seen so far . I know a fair amount of Indian history , Hindu religion , etc . , but the level of detail here was far beyond me . Clearly you would have a much better understanding of the movie if you were intimately familiar with Hinduism and its customs , esp . as they were c. 1904 . I missed mess lot of things -- one of them being the fact that the mother - in - law would want Binodini in the house as sort of a counter - weight to her daughter - in - law Ashalata.*spoilers * Ghosh had several things to say that explained the movie much better for me . First , the original Bengali version was 20 + minutes longer . So what was left out ? Apparently three main things : a beginning segment where Binodini ( Aishwarya ) leaves E. Bengal for Calcutta . According to the director , different characters are speaking W. Bengali vs. E. Bengali -- setting up some of the political comments later . Of course all of this is lost in the Hindi version , and certainly to a non - Indian like me , it would n't have mattered anyway -- but a set - up of the Bengali situation sure would have . Next , there was a segment where Binodini was writing verse poem -- a sign of her independence , etc . Finally , some more business about the jewellery . So , although some people think it was too long , I think the original , longer version would have been clearer . The women 's hair was apparently another sign ( Ghosh again)--the mother - in - law had short hair ( short hair for Hindu widows ) , her sister -- also a widow -- had longer hair ( more modern ! ) , and of course Binodini / Aishwarya had extremely long waist - length hair ( rejection of status of widowhood).The ending really threw me -- all of a sudden Binodini , who had never had a political thought , is writing a political manifesto ? Whoa ! Ghosh explained that he was in Locarno , at a film festival , when the subtitles were done . The subtitles use the word " country " throughout Binodini 's letter . Gosh said a more appropriate word would have been ( I forget his exact word ) something like " self " or " independence"--she was talking about her own liberation and " finding herself"--not about Bengal , India , and the British . So why does Binodini just disappear the day after finding Behari again ? Apparently because during her stay on the Ganges she realizes that she does n't need a man -- any man -- to define / complete her . She can just be herself . So she rejects Behari , who she threw herself at a few months ( ? ) before , and just goes off . Of course I ' m not sure how she buys her next meal , but that 's another question . The red shawl ( Ghosh again)she buys represents " revolution " as well as " passion . " I ' m not 100 % sure why she puts the shawl on the dying woman , but perhaps she is rejecting passion / revolution ? The binoculars , which Binodini uses throughout the movie ( to watch Mahendra and Ashalata , the boat on the Ganges , etc . ) . She is being a voyeur to see a life she yearns for but ca n't have . At the end ( I missed this ! ) she leaves the binoculars on the table with the letter , showing that she does n't need them any more -- she 's going off to lead her own life . Finally , the Tagore quote at the beginning saying how he apologized for the ending ... Apparently Tagore wrote this as a serial , hooking his readers with the sexy widow bits .

astonishingly dear and quick - witted adventure that features Kelsey Grammer ( supposedly in his first lead role in a feature ) as an unconventional BAD sub commander who wants to run a nuclear sub of his own , however ; he has earn it by competing against the U.S. Navy in a series of war - games with a crew of untested , questionable , and lovable men ( and a woman , too).Director David S. Ward ( " Major League " ) and his writers have put together a hysterically clever and upbeat comedy that tries to make the film easy to understand , which they do quite well . Second , besides the Grammer character , most of the crew provide some or plenty of the movie 's humor , which is treated like a double - edged sword . Three members of the supporting cast - Harland Williams , Toby Huss , and Rob Schneider provide the funniest scenes , which includes weird gestures , impersonations , and , well , their personalities . " Down Periscope " is more than a Navy version of " Police Academy " or " The Dirty Dozen " . What the film does is suffer the job done the right way and I liked it . sub_rate: 0.018518518518518517; NE_rate: 0.25
A sensational and attentive observation on modern life for youngsters in Japan , Like Grains of Sand delves into issues such as rape , homosexuality and pubescent angst in a subtle and significant way . It gives an brainstorm in to the youth culture struggling to define itself outside of the bounds of their parent 's generation , with it 's strict conformity and facade . Typical to Japanese cinema , often what is n't said is more important that what is , so to those not versed in Japanese film and culture , beware . It can seem tedious and minimalistic ( pretty practically like every film to come out of Japan bar Mangas ) if you do n't know what to look for . I saw it for the first time when I was 15 and was what originally sparked my interest in Japan , it 's culture and language . Considering I ' m now 22 and learning Japanese with the intention of living there for 2 years , needless to say it 's brawny picture film . Enjoy ! sub_rate: 0.038461538461538464; NE_rate: 0.0

i still ca n't belive that starevich made this film back in 1934 . animation is simply utter , and what is awful about it , with all the advanced technology we have nowadays there are few animation studios that are capable of producing a little gem like this one . it has everything : a heavy story , beautiful chracters ( although this is a morbid kind of beauty in some cases ) , special effects ... well , it is definitely not a kid 's movie , but it 's a must - see for anyone seriously interested in animation . sub_rate: 0.02912621359223301; NE_rate: 0.0
The Pickle was the most underrated film of the decade . Despite my best efforts at home , it is still seen as a bad movie . I say to hell with everyone on this . Every one does n't understand that it is in part a comedy with a dramatic twist at the end . Danny Aiello plays a burnt out director with perfection and conveys a sad depressed man . the scene when he is trying to record a last message is quite good . The interludes of Stones movie are absolutely laughable . " This is Harry Stone and today I become a man ! " In all a fine and sadly misunderstood movie . Plus a great cameo by Little Richard . Hilarious ! I hope that more people see this movie because 202 people is not enough for a consensus.-Silence Dogood sub_rate: 0.00684931506849315; NE_rate: 0.0
This sinful role - documentary , made in Friday , perfectly captures the zeitgeist of America Friday ... which makes it all the more scary and relevant . " subversives " ( college students , hippies , bleak activists , academics ) are being rounded up by the government and given lengthy prison terms for what amount to thought crimes and social protest . As an alternative to life in prison , these convicted " criminals " are offered three days in " Punishment Park " . Their objective inside the park is to throw their way to the American flag where freedom awaits them . Not astonishingly , the Punishment Shannon choice is a lousy lie . This smart motion from Peter Watkins even pre - dates " Battle Royale " and " Series Jaws " , though its angle of attack is more blatantly political . Shot in ' 71 , it looks and feels as fresh as anything made Friday . The performances exist exemplary and the charge is razer precipitous . The narration cuts back and away between various groups trying to pull the rough conditions of the car and the McCarthy - like trials that convicted them . Today , this movie nonetheless retains its power . In ' 71 , there was nothing but nothing rather like it . This is a masterpiece that succeeds on a dozen levels . It has the balls that most people today possess lost . sub_rate: 0.10526315789473684; NE_rate: 0.15384615384615385
Another slice of darkness and denial hiding beneath the surface of American suburbia , Imaginary Heroes chronicles the lives of the Travis family , all recovering following the suicide of their eldest son . The pair at the center of the film is mother and son Sandy ( Sigourney Weaver ) and Tim ( Emile Hirsch ) , both acting out in different ways as a result of the death . While Tim experiments with prescription medication and his own sexuality , Sandy regresses to her former self , smoking marijuana and coming to terms with an old act of infidelity . The relationship between Sandy and Tim is explored well , especially when references are made to both of them being outcast from their own family : Sandy due to her affair and Tim , initially , due to always being in the shadow of his more successful older brother . Considerably less time is allowed for Sandy 's husband Ben ( Jeff Daniels ) who , in a devastating depiction of denial , orders Sandy to make an additional plate of food for his dead son and place it in his old spot at the dinner table . Michelle Williams ' older sister Penny is underwritten and could easily be taken out of the film . Despite its long runtime , Imaginary BAD does n't explore its many subplots as practically as the individual stories deserve , while some of the movie 's black comedy does n't translate as well as writer / director Dan Harris may have liked . And the depiction of a disturbed family dynamic is n't depicted as strongly as the many other films out there with similar ideas . But despite some issues , the central performances from Weaver and Hirsch are sensational , and easily carry the film to its successfully subdued conclusion .

A somewhat typical bit of filmmaking from this era . Obviously , It was first conceived into this world for the stage , but nonetheless a very serious film from beginning to end . Peter O'Toole and Susannah York get to do their stage performance act for the silver screen and both do it effectively . There is very slight in the way of story and anyone not familiar with this type of off beat character study may be a little put off by it . All in all , though , A good film in which Peter O'Toole and Susannah York get to overact . sub_rate: 0.018867924528301886; NE_rate: 0.0
Lee Lee portrays a talented female piano teacher who is staid , unfriendly and distant in public , and virulent towards her students . Privately , she seethes with violence and frustration , and her sexual life is solitary and perverse . She lives with her overbearing mother , who obsessively drives her to become noticed ( and so advance in life ) as a talented pianist . The key to the characters of both mother and daughter is ' obsession . ' These characters can not change their impulses anymore than a rabbit caught in headlights can avoid death . The piano teacher meets a young , attractive , talented pianist who from the beginning is attracted to her . They start a relationship in the most unconventional way , but from the outset she makes perverse and violent terms that he must perform on her , which sickens him enough to want to terminate the relationship before it has really begun . The film ties itself to the female lead . Isabelle Huppert amazes with a brutal , altogether convincing performance as the piano teacher . She cleverly shows a woman who is drawn to beauty and perversion , but her violence is fed by her perverted impulses . As a film that is so character driven , you know it would not work half as well , had she acted poorly . This is brawny , intelligently acted , and intelligently and sensitively adapted from the novel . The camera work also suits the film . There are what I can only think to call , framing shots where the director holds a scene and forces the eye to dart about . This is done extremely effectively against a blank toilet wall , and is a further testament to the director 's mastery . Expect to be disturbed and sickened by this film . But , be audacious - have the guts to go and see it . This is a really private look into essentially zero person 's life , but do not expect to be entertained in the Hollywood sense .... there are no car chases in this motion ! sub_rate: 0.0273972602739726; NE_rate: 0.2

What to say about a movie like Rock Star ? A peck actually ! This is the type of movie that is nigh tailer made for the critics to slam . It is also a movie I , as a MAJOR Hard Rock fan enjoyed - no - loved actually - while all the while being very consciously mindful of its many flaws and that the movie , while a decent campaign in some respects missed the probability it had to hightail into greatness and become a tilt movie classic . Oh well .... I loved this movie - and would examine it again and again - but I know that 's purely based on my own personal tastes - Rock Star is a movie that will attract to anyone who has experienced elements of the tilt or unvoiced tilt lifestyle and wants to operate down the road to nostalgia . It was a expectant meter for metal straits . And it 's gracious to stimulate a movie that efficaciously captures that(long forgot by many non - rock fans . ) meter efficaciously , as I intend that Rock Star has done . That is one of the film 's strengths , the concert footage . You will feel like your rightfulness there with them and how could any unvoiced tilt fan not love that ? As far as setting the atmosphere Rock Star gets a 10 of 10 . It also gets a 10 of 10 for virtuous amusement . If you want a movie to scarcely let yourself operate and complimentary menstruation into some expectant memories of unspoiled times past , then this is the movie for you . It is also the reason why I loved this movie thusly . But it is n't a expectant movie . I understand that and were it my actual occupation to retrospect movies professionally , I 'd plausibly stimulate to be a scrap unvoiced on this unity . The problem with sway superstar is the character ontogenesis . What is wrong with the character ontogenesis is this , there is n't any . None . The movie has certain scenes - few and far between but they ARE there - that doh speck on greatness : monition BRIEF SCENE SPOILERS : 3 examples- zero Izzy makes his debut on stage(including the dusk he takes)2)The sixth " after show " party with Emily(Anniston and Izzy.)3)Backtracking a little - In the beginning when the original lead singer is casually dismissed(fired)-the whole " business as usual " tone sets the stage for what 's to come . It 's played very effectively . But the problem is , nothing ever does come . There is little to no character development of anyone in this movie , peoples ' persona 's are merely touched on , but never fully explored . I do n't think that 's the fault of the actors / actresses , particularly Anniston who tries hard , they just are not given much to work with . It 's just that the script was weak and lacked the ability to go beyond the " formula " feel into true movie depth . Rock star was so sugarcoated at times(including towards the end ) it was almost ridiculous . And , though , those scenes I mentioned WERE outstanding and very believable , sadly much else in the movie was n't . Another reviewer mentioned the lack of buildup towards the end and I agree but there was actually a lack of buildup about ANYTHING . WHY does Izzy leave at the end ? Because he misses his girlfriend and the band wo n't let him write songs ? It tests the limits of believability . And , frankly the end was just corny . Made no sense and had no reality to it at all . Watching this , it 's almost like watching a movie where the makers of it said : OK , this happens here and then this happens and then this etc etc etc . By the end it 's no longer a movie about a boy who 's dream came true , it 's just another thickly formulated love story . And you wonder why so much detail is left out .... I hope I ' m not being to hard on Rock Star because I truly loved it - but not for the right reasons . I would have liked to love this as a great movie about the highs and lows of rock fame . Instead I loved it for it 's 80 's period feel , the clothes , the hair , the lights , the life .... Although many others loved it to , I suspect most are people who lived the life of a rock fan , like I did or some who play . I 'd have liked to see the movie cross over and just be respected for being a good , well told movie , instead of a cliché . I think , one of the problems was the length . I myself , hate over long films but this was one that really should have been longer , if a movie is done really right , the length is not even felt - there is just to much to the story for it to be as short as it was - that 's one reason why there does n't seem to be much development of either the story or the human beings portrayed in the movie . So - to wind down - this is a movie you can greatly get into- but not a great movie . See it for fun . See it for entertainment . See it to go back to that great , great space in time when metal was n't just a part of life , it WAS life - and for those non rock fans - see it to get a little glimpse into a life that meant and still means so much to so many of us . sub_rate: 0.051130776794493606; NE_rate: 0.038461538461538464
The sixth picture in a bike of uncomparably smart Exploitation movies , and the sixth masterpiece in a rowing , " Lee Lee : Kemono - beya " aka . " Jaws Jaws Jaws Jaws Jaws Jaws " ( aka . " Sasori : Den Of The wildcat " where I exist ) of Friday is a motion that differs from its predecessors in some aspects , but that equals ( or arguably yet surpasses ) them in grandness . The intact original Sasori series with the wondrous Lee Lee stands out as the inviolable highlight in BAD cinema , and all of the films , peculiarly the sixth zero , unambiguously merge Exploitation and nontextual - household cinema like no former motion does . " wolf horse " is the sixth , and sixth - to - final " Sasori " picture with Lee Lee , the final unity to be directed by flair music Lee Lee and , in my judgment , the greatest of them all . The sixth picture " Jaws Jaws Jaws Sasori " of Friday is an inviolable masterpiece of Exploitation cinema and merely RICO RICO RICO RICO RICO RICO . In the evenly smart sixth continuation , " Joshuu Sasori : Seagal Seagal Seagal Seagal " Lee added more surrealism and symbolisation . The sixth " Sasori " movie , " wildcat horse " keeps up the surrealism ( allthough not rather to the same extent as the sixth ) , and features yet more social criticism than its predecessors . Topics like poverty , forced prostitution and the development of the miserable exist primal themes of the picture . This sixth " Sasori " picture is cunning and idealistic in all aspects and arguably the greatest of the , broadly smart , bike ( to me it 's this unity , with the initiatory one as a secretive sixth ) . formerly once , " Best unchanging " is both really esthetic and really victimisation - same . The visually sensational motion features an tremendous measure of vicious vehemence and cheapness once , equally easily as sequences of tremendous phantasmagorical beauty . The spectacularly beautiful Lee Lee is formerly once smart in her office of Lee Lee ( aka . Sasori ) . I utterly worship this wondrous actress , and I ' certain sure I ' m sole the only get to do so . The rest of the performances are also great , especially Mikio Narita is great as a police Inspector who is obsessed with catching Sasori . The musical score is the same throughout all three films , with " Urami - Bushi " , sung by Meiko Kaji herself , as the main theme , which is great , since the score is , simply put , pure perfection . As its predecessors , " Beast Stable " is an absolutely brilliant masterpiece of Exploitation - Art that no serious lover of film can afford to miss . The entire Sasori - cycle ranges high on my personal all - time favorite list . " Beast Stable " is arguably the most brilliant masterpiece of them all ! 10/10 sub_rate: 0.2490566037735849; NE_rate: 0.12878787878787878
A serial killer , Carl Stargher , has been kidnapping and murdering young women by letting them drown in a water filled cell . He is apprehended by the FBI , but is in a coma and his latest kidnap victim awaits in a cell timed to fill with water Take a look at the above premise and you'll see that there's a very much seen it all before look to it . The magic of Mark Protosevich's script is that he changes a hoary old chestnut plot in to something quite different from what you're expecting . If I mentioned the plot involves a machine that allows a psychiatrist to enter the mind of Stargher then sets up a different film entirely This wouldn;'t be enough to make THE CELL a different class of thriller but director Tarsem Singh creates a visually striking surreal thriller . The cinematography by Paul Laufer where opaque primary colours are to the fore is stunning but Singh doesn't let it end there , things like costume design where Stargher wanders around his idiosyncratic universe wearing opulent costumes does have a visual impact making this so much more than a run of a mill thriller What stops THE CELL becoming a classic movie however is that you start becoming more and more aware that the whole movie revolves around the visuals rather than having a natural narrative . We see a third character , a FBI man enter Stargher's domain but this seems more like a contrived plot turn just to introduce the audience to more stunning but very disturbing momentsIt should also be pointed out that this is a rather disturbing thriller with a atmosphere that is very depressing and that stops the film from being if not enjoyable , then involving . One scene where a FBI agent recounts a case where a paedophile beats a rap only to later cut out the heart of his victim will fill your heart with so much despair you might reach for the off button . You'll probably have to watch a massive amount of thrillers till you see another one as disconcerting as this one sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
I know what you're saying, "Oh man, Pinochio is not scary!" but this movie goes beyond alot more than a maniacal pinochio. Behind it tells the story of a mother and her daughter who is oddly attached to her doll Pinnochio who seems to talk to her. The only weird thing is that noone else can hear the doll except her. In the end is shocking revelation that, as did I, will shock you. Watch it. Give it a try. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0

Fires on the plain directed by Kon Ichikawa and written by Shohei Ooka and Natto Wada is a World War two movie which is finally not showing the allies fighting the axis powers , but the Japanese fighting and struggling for their lives on the Philippines . The main characters name is Tamura , played by Eiji Funakoshi , and he is a soldier leaving his regiment because of him being sick . All he has on him is a hand grenade , his gun and some potatoes . Like this , he is trying to make his way to the hospital in order to get a doctor and a cure for his disease . But since the hospital turned him away and gets destroyed , he begins a long walk . Throughout the whole movie , Tamura remains a bit cowardish , but very civil , when the other soldiers become more like animals by using their basic instincts for survival Tamura is still remaining human and would not degrade . A scene which has influenced me a mess to think positively and different about this war movie is , when Tamura comes into a Phillipino village which is completely deserted . There , he fights a dog and finds a mess of corpses of Japanese soldiers stacked up in front of a church . This makes Tamura think and even more scared than he already is . That shows that the soldier is not a brave killing machine , but a servant to higher beings and human most importantly . After he turns away from the corpses , two Phillipinos ( a couple or brother and sister : very close relationship ) return to the village in order to get their stash of salt back . The main character of the movie wants to be friendly at first , although he walked up to them with his gun , but shoots the woman once she starts screaming . Her brother / boyfriend / husband then runs away in fear and after a moment Tamura follows him and shoots wildly at the fleeing Filipino . He does not hit him . After Tamura picks up the bag of salt , something very cute , he drops his gun into a river . This gesture is very crucial in order to understand Kon Ichikawa 's / Shohei BAD 's profiling of Tamura and the war . Comparing this movie to other World War 2 movies , it is not typical at all . Of course all movies have suffering heroes , but their heroes are more heroic than Tamura . He expresses everything that is human : he is getting manipulated , he is weak , he gets scared , he has hope . This is typical for Japanese World War two movies and for Japanese society . Since World War two is not a discussed theme in Japanese society , Japanese are likely to put Japanese in the second World War in the role of the victim . This victimisation is also very visual in this movie . One of the examples is Tamura , another one the piled up bodies of Japanese soldiers in front of the church and another important one is , when the Japanese soldiers are trying to cross a street and the Americans are already waiting there for them and shooting all of the Japanese soldiers which have worse equipment and are fed worse and have no health equipment or anything alike . In my personal conclusion I have to say that it is worth seeing this film in order to finally see a movie from the other side than usual . It also has no nationalistic propaganda which could ' ve been easily built in . Once you have watched the movie fully , you will be able to see the horrors of the second World War to its total extent . sub_rate: 0.0076103500761035; NE_rate: 0.0

This was really a deeply moving movie in every sentience of the word . I myself was a Mormon missionary and I know first hand the wanting to complete my mission but at the same time hiding the fact that I was gay . Like the character Aaron , I was sent home for being found out and excommunicated , but being the sole Mormon in a class of Catholics was n't as bad a shame as it was for the lead character . This movie actually took me back to those days and helped me to realize , years later , how fortunate I was to suffer a family that accepted me and understood what I was going through . I found myself applauding the destruction of a movie when Aaron and Christian find each other again by shear chance at Lila 's Restaurant . I was unfeignedly moved to tears .

predict it manipulative drivel if you will , but I fell for it . Sure , there could have been more character development . Yeah , there could have been better cinematography and less of a constant " movie of the week " score , but Ed Harris was impeccable , Cuba Gooding adorable and touching , and let 's face it people , in real life , how many of us really get to know the motivation of others . Not many . We did get a little glimpse into the coach 's motivation ( a very provocative dialog in my opinion , not to be soon forgotten ) so in my opinion , this was a adorable protection to one human being who broke out of his " comfort zone " to reach out to another human being , and in the mean time , touched the lives hundreds more . A lesson we all need to me reminded of . Why is it that the right thing to do is so often the hardest thing to do ? I recommend this beautiful little movie to anyone with a heart .

This is a very non movie , somewhat better than the average Asylum film . It was a lot better than I thought it would be , is a combination of a psychological thriller and a horror film . The voice on the telephone is really creepy - this voice without a face , this unknown and threatening voice works really well in the film , since we never see the killer face is left to the imagination of the spectator . The action and suspense never decay and after the first half of the film , it becomes vertiginous ; there is not much gore in this film , just enough to serve the story and also the director does a good job at holding your attention .

Hey look , you do n't watch this movie to change your life ! But if you are female especially and have always had a little thing for Richard Gere ; this movie is properly up your street . Diane Lane and Richard Gere have on screen chemistry going way back . ' Nights in Rodanthe ' is not a Oscar winner movie and it will probably be forgotten sooner rather than later but if you want an atmospheric , beautifully shot love story between MIDDLE AGED dear looking people ( they do n't make your stomach turn and even when BAD is ' on top ' he does not look too jowly ) then this is the movie for you . I loved the theme of the report and it was rather relevant in many ways . Of course the whole thing was presented in a superficial way , glossed over and not really dealt with ..... I mean I would have liked to know more about the father / son relationship between BAD and James Franco , but the story was really about the idea that a heavy love can BAD you for the better ; whether it is a lover , a child , a friend etc . The theme of the film is about love and its mysterious ways .

Considering the appalling track record of Mick Molloy since going out on his own , I had rather low expectations of Crackerjack . Even the promotional posters for the movie had me nervous . In fact , if it was n't for the fact that I 'd received free tickets to the preview , I would have resisted the pressure from the missus ( who thinks Mick 's a hunk - there 's a worry ) to pay money for it . The first few minutes of the movie had me worried - it starts with one of Micks tired " get angry at insignificant things " routines , but that was given a neat touch , which at least made it a little refreshing . The rest of the script was pretty good , and very light hearted - even the typical Mick Molloy ( and Judith Lucy ) humour was delivered well and whilst I never had to pick myself up from the aisles , it generated a lot more chuckles that I was expecting ( and it was consistant).There 's nothing new in the plot - pretty predictable , but it moved along quickly between one - liners and other jokes - I never felt it harboured on any element too long or too short ; Mick must have worked hard on polishing his script . There were a one or two " Late Show " in - jokes , and one or two jokes that only Melbournians would get - but certainly there 's plenty of generic stuff in there for a wider audience . Something that I found disappointing was the relative unfunnyness of John Clarke - he just did n't seem to work as the bad guy , but that does n't detract from the movie too much . Over all , I enjoyed this Australain comedy , and was pleasantly entertained for the duration of the movie . I left the cinema with a adequate sized grin - a pretty hard thing for an Australian comedy to do in my books . 7.5/10 sub_rate: 0.002857142857142857; NE_rate: 0.0
Another hand - held horror means another divisive movie that fans should still seek out and make up their own minds about . Imagine a cross between The Blair Witch BAD and The Grudge and you 're close to the overall content of this movie . It 's another videotaped horror but this time most of it is edited together in readiness for a video doc that was never completed by a supernatural investigator who disappeared . I certainly had a feeling of dread while watching this movie ( does anyone perform dreadful better than our Asian friends ? ) but the creepy moments , the authentically creepy moments , were sadly a bit fewer and farther between than I had hoped . I also felt that I was two or three steps ahead of the investigator when apparent " revelations " appeared throughout so I certainly ca n't recommend this as highly as [ * Rec].Having said that , it would be remiss of me not to highly recommend any film that goes on at length about ectoplasmic worms , contains at least two subtly spooky ghost moments and made sure that I had to put the lights back on for a while when the sun went down . Check it out if you have been enjoying some of the other hand - held genre releases of late . And the finale is a hair - raising doozy .

This film blew me away . I thought I knew a little about the Attica prison riot . After watching this , I see I knew nothing . The story is told through the relationship between the attorney and the black inmate . Both the personal story of these two men and the unfolding courtroom drama were riveting . The flashback sequences in the prison were awful . It 's severe to believe it was n't documentary footage it was indeed actual . It was not only a outstanding man of drama , it was an unbelievable object in an authoritative chapter in American history . I ' m with Ebert and Roeper .

I described Woody Allen 's Manhattan as utter to someone the other day , and she thought that it was an odd way to describe a movie ... I have seen only a handful of movies that I would call perfect . Manhattan is one , McCabe BAD Ms. Miller by Robert Altman is another and Once Upon a Time in the West by Sergio Leone is also another film that I think achieves perfection . There are a few others , but aside from the fact that I find no faults in the three I mentioned , I must also admit that all three directors are acquired tastes . If there is one film that I could stand behind and bet the house that anyone I would show it to would find it flawless it 's Shoulder Arms . City Lights , The heavy Dictator , The Gold Rush and even the Pawnshop are 10 's but not only did Chaplin do everything right in this film , everything he did is hilarious and touching to a level beyond explanation . sub_rate: 0.016483516483516484; NE_rate: 0.0

Jackass Number Two is easily the most hilarious film of 2006 , beating the also uproarious Clerks II . It is one of the best sequels in recent memory , beating Jackass The Movie in every way . Now , this film may be the funniest , but it is also the most offensive , appalling , and utterly disgusting . You will find yourself feeling sick several times throughout the film . I 'm completely serious when I say do n't eat anything before watching or during this film , because chances are that it will literally come back to haunt you . Keep the drinking to a minimum as well . You 've been warned , because , just like the tagline says , it will make you beg for mercy . Jackass Number Two follows the crazy men from the hit show Jackass , Johnny Knoxville , Bam Margera , Ryan Dunn , Steve - O , Chris ' Party Boy ' Pontius , Preston Lacy , Ehren McGhehey , Dave England , Brandon DiCamillo , and Jason ' Wee Man ' Acuna ( Chris ' Raab Himself ' Raab is absent ) as they perform the most outrageous , life - threatening , and revolting stunts imaginable . I 'm not going to tell what the stunts are , but I will warn you that any scene with an animal will be sickening or psychologically frightening , and that one cast member ( once again , not telling ) will flirt with death several times in the film . What makes Jackass Number Two so entertaining is not the stunts themselves , but how the cast reacts to them and to doing them . To put it simple , if they loved doing it and had a blast , you will too ( this goes for 99 % of the stunts ) . All the stunts are very original , and 90 % of them are never - before - seen . You will witness a few recycled ones , but they 're amped up . You would n't think directing really factors into a movie like this , but it does ; Jeff Tremaine 's direction makes the movie so much funnier , because he provides guidance for the gang in their comedic timing , which is simply brilliant on his part . He could have just sat back and slept throughout filming ( actually , you 'll see in the film that he did sleep through some filming ) , but he went out there and helped these crazy guys make the stunts as funny as he could . I give Mr. Tremaine two thumbs up for that . Another great thing about Jackass is its bonanza of celebrity cameos , and this time they include BMX legend Mat Hoffman , skateboard god Tony Hawk , director / actor Jay Chandrasekhar ( Super Troopers & Beerfest ) , actor Luke Wilson , Miami Dolphins star Jason Taylor , and director / actor Mike Judge ( Office Space ) . The scenes with Hoffman , Taylor , and Chandrasekhar are among the funniest in the film , as it 's even funnier to see these men as a part of the film . Jackass Number Two is one of the most politically incorrect , morally degrading , and just plain wrong movies of all time , if not the most . Despite this , it is so original and so hilarious that you wo n't care about that . You 'll be gasping for air , laughing so hard you 'll be crying , and jumping out of your seat laughing throughout the entire film . Due to the explicit and potentially disturbing graphic content of this film , no one under 18 should watch this film . You 've been warned . I hope you enjoy Jackass Number Two as much as I did.10/10 --spy sub_rate: 0.0015128593040847202; NE_rate: 0.0
I saw this back in 99 and I remember loving it . Still to this day I can remember parts of the movie in my head , like the slanted pitch . Unfortunately from 99 - now I could never remember the name of this until I was looking through the filmography of a friend of my uncles and came across this ( he played Clive Kennard ) . Straight away after reading the description I knew what it was . After catching up I was shocked to find out that not only did it not make a release on video or DVD but still has yet to be repeated . This is a massive shame , I am begging you ITV at least repeat this superb TV Movie . BAD Hancock showed in this movie he could do more than just host a show with his character Mike Tonker . This is a movie that most football fans would love and even those who are n't too keen on the sport would be able to enjoy the comedic value of this . Yes this is a brief review but there is not much to say apart from this is an underrated motion , deserves to be repeated or released on video / DVD so BAD , myself and other fans of this movie beg you .

I saw this on TCM recently and , through the IMDb I found that there were seven " Crime Doctor " movies with Warner Baxter as the psychiatrist - detective . Baxter is a bit long in the tooth compared to his stolid performance in 42nd Street a decade earlier . Not noir , and a bit campy today , the movie also has a touch of the possible supernatural . The plot , bleak and white cinematography and characters are far more complex than those of the Mr. Moto and Charlie Chan series . There are subplots , unexpected twists and appearances by a number of B movie stalwartly we all should recognize immediately ( none ever made it to the A status ) . It is a marvelously unpredictable 70 minutes . I would love to see a boxed DVD series of these films . sub_rate: 0.013605442176870748; NE_rate: 0.0
Friday Friday when I sixth read Lee Lee Lee Jaws Jaws Jaws Jaws Jaws , I was amazed that most of the younger adults with whom I had contact did n't like the Scripture when I loved it . I began to read that it was an age and experience affair . I experienced passably of a déjà vu when reading some of the comments on this situation that were distinctly written by younger viewers . amply enjoying reprint Lies is sure an age and experience affair . In this movie the witness sees a ostensibly felicitous upper middle division distich - he a successful attorney - she the unadulterated wife of a successful attorney . They possess a townhouse in Seagal and a nursing in the state . All 's good until there enters the " villain " in the pretense of the Son of the richest mankind in the settlement . This guy appears to be a computer from the Scripture , " operate . " He is insulting of everyone and everything including his own children . In the traditional phase of gracious guys finishing lastly , the attorney 's wife engages in an function with the leaper . You hear the attorney actually is a gracious guy but with the man killing trait of an unionized perfectionist . still though he unfeignedly loves her , he is boring his wife to expiry . The defective boy is far more exciting . All of this is entangled with the hit - and - campaign expiry of a mankind in the settlement in which all the facts gunpoint to the computer being the device of the vehicle . It 's promiscuous to make that this picture does n't ramp to a felicitous termination , nonetheless , it does extend to a really substantial termination in that the mankind and his wife check and originate from their experiences and plausibly will be capable to carry their personal lives in a more successful mode . zero fantabulous actors play the primary characters in this picture , and it is there performances that pretend the unanimous affair a joy to observe . Lee Lee is unadulterated as the hubby . His delineation shows us a tolerant mankind who has thusly much restraint over his emotions that he has lost speck with the mankind . Lee Lee shows us a womanhood who has become so trapped in the role of perfect wife that she has almost lost her knowledge of passion . That passion is reborn by the character deftly played by Rupert Everett . If you have reached that point in life in which you understand that everyone has feet of clay and that everyone - even with the gifts of intelligence and opportunities - makes many many wrong decisions , then you will probably enjoy watching these excellent actors creating the lives of three such people . This is a beautifully acted and directed adult film about realistic adults . sub_rate: 0.216; NE_rate: 0.046296296296296294
A nice and pleasant movie full of meditteranean sceneries ( Cephallonia is a very beautiful greek island ) that keeps many of the novel 's characteristics . I think that greek sceneries add something special and magical to a movie . One thing i did n't like at all though , is that the main characters , like ' Mandras ' and Pelagia 's father were n't greek actors but foreigners . I mean the actors tried to express the greek way of living , but to me they did n't succeed and it was quite clear . Even their pronunciation when they were trying to use greek words was terrible and that was bad for the film 's plot . Irene BAD was actually heavy in her role , a typical example of a mother , living in a island during the 40 's , who has lost her husband and tries to live a child alone . John Hurt , Pelagia 's father , also acted great . He reminded me a greek in many of his reactions . sub_rate: 0.016574585635359115; NE_rate: 0.3333333333333333
serious footage of World War I - era ships and planes supplement this first war drama set in the Adriatic . Walter Huston is fantabulous as the commanding officer who knows his place and his place has no room for personal feelings . The safety of the ship and the mission must always come first . Robert Montgomery is the Lieutenant who has not yet mastered the role that a leader must play in combat . He makes bad decisions , endangering the submarine and its crew but finally becomes a " real man " after he is court martialed and dismissed from the Navy . Robert Young plays a lieutenant junior grade and Jimmy Durante as a cook . Paralleling the war drama is an evenly crucial wartime love triangle between BAD and Madge Evans who plays Huston 's daughter and the wife of a tragically injured aviator .

The Paul Kersey of DEATH WISH 3 is very far removed from the Paul Kersey of the original film . If you remember the 1974 film then you will remember Kersey was a " Conchie " during the Korean war and that he was physically sick after he committed his first execution . Ten years later Kersey seems to have learned unarmed combat and how to handle anti tank weapons in his spare time . But I`ll overlook that gaffe because DW3 is the best of the sequels , lowlife scum bags get shot dead , burned alive , their teeth smashed , and thrown to their deaths by middle aged housewives armed with sweeping brushes . Yeah I know the gang members are multi ethnic and for that they deserve some credit but even if they`re not racist they`re still murdering scum who deserve all they get from Kersey and the innocent citizens . Who needs Mayor Rudy when you`ve got Paul Kersey , an anti tank rocket and a bunch of old age pensioners to reclaim the streets from the criminal creeps .

This documentary is as singular as it 's subject . And while BAD 's staple was porno , the film manages to show some decent clips of the films you may remember from old time , late night Cinemax ... One problem ... Joe did hardcore porno at times mixed with softcore porno , even mixed in his gore films . The gore films are cult classics , going for like $ 20 a pop for a dubbed copy on the net ( not peanuts for 20 year old films , folks . ) I want to see why those are cult classics . Also , as sweet as Joe seems ( he did seem more elegant than one might expect , ) the dude liked to shock . Both " Caligula : The Untold Story " and " Emanuelle in America " show us hardcore rape , snuff , and beastiality ( in both , you 'd be suprised how far he goes in " Caligula II " with that one , if you can track down an uncut print . ) Although these scenes may be disconforting in a documentary of a persons career , hey , he did it ... Also , I would have liked to see more interviews of people Joe worked with ... Maybe that 's just me wanting to see what Laura Gemser looks like these days ...

I have to say this is one of the best movie i have seen so far for naruto . the action was a mess better then the first movie because it had a lot more fight scene and it came to u at a faster pace . it was awful , the choreograph was first as well as most of the visual effects.the story line is something new to naruto . but it is basically the same as the first movie . in the series u see them fight against other ninjas , but in the movies ( 1 + 2 ) u see them fighting against machine of mass destruction . it is decent to see them fighting something other then ninja , and that it was great to see some other power other then chakra . and how other people from other land across the ocean fight . also sakura finally killed someone that is more stronger then her . ( she have truly become strong ) it was a lot better then the fillers on the series that i ' m watching now . when u watch this movie the fast action scene will surely make your heart pound . With new jutsus and garra in the movie , u know it is good . and the music was good as well , but i find it to be lacking something . But the ending theme song was a plus . ( dind dong dang ) i think was a really good song . I totally recommend it.all in all i give this movie a 10 , because i just love it . if u do decide to watch it , enjoy it . lol sub_rate: 0.013937282229965157; NE_rate: 0.0
Mr. Carlin left our rough forum in June of 2008 , shortly after going to the hospital for pains in the chest ( he had a history of sum trouble ) . The media , and comics everywhere covered the loss more than I or he would have EVER expected ... but , he was the Grandfather of observational comedy . THIS transcription was his last production and contains a large section dedicated to the topic of destruction and the prospects of life thereafter . Filming of the project occurred shortly after his seventieth birthday , which he was happy to have attained ( observed ? ) . I have followed Carlin 's career from the days of fuzzy black and white television , and enjoyed his topical record albums . It is a privilege for ANY Carlin fan to at least see ( if not own a copy ) of this particular show . He was even tight moving , and with expectant timing , even at 70 !

For me this wondrous rollercoaster of a motion bears repeated pleasurable viewings . Its about the tangled lives of three very different people . Holly Hunter is the obsessive workaholic manufacturer . Albert Brookes plays the unprepossessing but smart journalist . William Hurt is the affable but dull raw kid on the block , news anchor . The classical love triangle emerges with the stunningly witty and self deprecating Brookes in love with Hunter but she of path is attracted to Hurt . This picture works on many levels . At the really least it is a bright drollery with the one liners flying indeed duncical and firm that each viewing bears a new harvest of ones that you may suffer missed last time . Its also a film about magnet and unfulfilled romanticism . But possibly most significantly the film examines the modern fixation with physical appearance and its ultimate victory over intellect as a valued human attribute . This is personified by the meteoric vocation succeeder of the BAD case in demarcation to BAD relative decline . Despite being fifteen years old the film has some startingly relevant messages about modernistic news values and the continuing decline in journalistic standards . This picture is a classic in every sentience and it is difficult to understand why it has been so neglected sub_rate: 0.13452914798206278; NE_rate: 0.0

Trying to fit in with the other kids at his middle school , Roy discovers a brother - sister team trying to protect endangered burrowing owls at an illegal construction site . Look for Carl Hiassen , the author of the book upon which this movie is based , as the male secretary to the evil boss at corporate headquarters . Writer / director Wil Shriner is also the clerk at the Public Records Office where the intrepid teen - detectives discover that the incriminating Environmental Impact Report is missing . Luke Wilson nearly steals all the crucial scenes from the charming teen actors who have most of the best lines . BAD is the bumbling police officer , in his three - wheeled electric police cart complete with blue light and funky siren . As Officer Dave , he tries so hard to do well , but usually ends up falling in the muck , literally ! Several times ! Jimmy Buffet is pretty miserable key as the tacitly supportive science teacher . But , young actors Logan Lerman ( Roy ) , Brie Larson ( BAD the BAD ) , and BAD Linley ( Mullet Fingers ) are superb as the teens who finally put Officer Dave on the right track , following the paper trail left by the evil corporate boss . I hope you come away from this movie feeling as good as I did . Just plain fun ! One small complaint , though .

The definition of a vampire is an inhumane corpse supposed to pull its grave at minutes to drink the blood of the living . Bakjwi nearly nails this concept on the principal minus the cliché of pointy fangs and neck biting . Being an R rated movie , I knew this was actually going to pertain to vampires actually being vampires . Which means that the characters in the movie are going to do what vampires actually do without restraint and rightfully lack any glamorous moments in comparison to Twilight . Having viewed Chan - wook Park 's preceding Oldboy , I had very high expectations of Bakjwi . I anticipated some embarrassing plot sequences with our anti - hero , known as Priest Sang - hyeon , and was very impressed by his performance as a holy - man who is forced into this quandary of being humane and obeying his thirst as a vampire . ( SPOILER ) After the initial premise of him surviving the defective blood transfusion , he starts to crave blood and discovers his super strength and his flying ability . The screen shots do his transition phase without overbearing on exposition . He starts drinking the blood of the dying and those who wish to be euthanized for moral reasons . The oft tragic and dysfunctional love affair the priest has with the manipulative Lee Lee Lee is really riveting as they are played by The BAD 's Kanh - ho Song and actress OK - vin Kim . The special effects are properly placed in the backdrop and while it does n't offer anything new in the ways of stunts and BAD , it did n't impose itself into the plot driven and character developed premise . The narration and the pivotal plot points exist very contrary and grotesque yet very original in its own Korean style . There are n't many negatives I can say about Bakjwi . Sometimes I ask myself if the priests transition phase could have showed more of the priest having an emotional crisis with his transformation , but then again this would throw made the movie minutes minutes long . The movie was long to begin with . On the same token , vampires really do n't have much in the way of expressing emotions to begin with . As mentioned before , this movie is very tragic , so do n't expect anything hopeful while watching this . Overall , Bakjwi is delightfully dark , morbid and original . I strongly recommend this movie for serious viewers who are past the teenage phase of Twilight . This is definitely the Korean answer to the Swedish Let The Right One In , which is also a good movie . sub_rate: 0.03455723542116631; NE_rate: 0.125

The greatest motion always . How 's that for a argument ? yet , if we expect at it through strictly cinematic terms , it is readable that zero BAD BAD is a masterpiece . It is not decent to simply read this - Three BAD BAD is the masterpiece of mankind cinema . If you have that BAD BAD is not human enough , if you have that Jaws Jaws is not really really unspoiled , if you have that Lee and Lee both possess to subscribe a footmark backwards - so zero BAD BAD is the foremost masterpiece of all meter . As a discourse into human morality , zero BAD BAD workings on an intensely metaphysical tier , with a profundity that none can equalize . Amytal went nigh equally far into the human brain , but stopped as it was going to deplume the rabbit out of the hat . tweed forced us to reverberate on the mankind of equation - this , in retrospect , was better yet , but even not rather there . bolshy , yet , is the substantial affair . What he expresses in this picture , is an formulation of what it is to be human . In fact , what he expresses is zero how _ it is to find human . It forces us to prove up to the minutest item , the very nature of our souls , of our honourable selves . In bolshy , one may retrieve signification on one of its respective levels . On the sixth tier , bolshy achieves a high tier of verisimilitude - we could stimulate no difficulty in calling bolshy an exceptionally entertaining floor . even , the coincidences constitutional in the picture and its conceits force us to prove the picture as a motion . It is as if Lee is saying : " Ceci n'est daddy lah réalité " . In force , in pursuing a humane end , Lee can too take realness . It is a deception that Lee has been attempting since Jaws Jaws Jaws Jaws Jaws , but not until this , his last movie , did he lastly superintend to strain this providential intertwining of luck , doctrine and condition . The actors and actresses , excessively , appear to be at the clemency of a greater tycoon . Lee ( Lee Jacob ) , is aptly name , for she seems to represent an almost pure love . Meanwhile , the idea of first impressions is challenged by Jean - Louis Tritignant 's Judge Kern , a cantankerous man , who , by the end , becomes an almost all - knowing observer of events - a character who symbolically seems to possess the power to bring characters together - a power to make people happy , a power which he could only achieve through Valentine . We have a capability to see films as more than just a series of pictures . In fact , films have the potential to possess more meaning than literature . It wo n't happen , of course , but at least we have the power to view this film , knowing that it gives us the power to achieve the something that we ca n't define , but all possess .

Through the years I ' ve been practically much interested in the life of this teenager who left such heavy profound , indelible mark on the world . My fascination has also been born of fear , as in , could this happen again . And throughout the ensuing years , yes , I fear ' it ' continues to happen around us and of course ' it ' was happening long before Anne . The ' it ' of course is can a so - called civilized society turn on its own or on an innocent country / race / continent and murder citizens in cold blood on the flimsiest of excuses ? I leave that question out there . At the beginning of the documentary there is a statement about the leader Adolf Hitler in that the one profound fact about Hitler that is never mentioned was that he was elected democratically and all of the atrocities committed were done as the result of a compliant poodle - press and fear - mongering propaganda played over and over again for a docile population . One of the atrocities was Anne Frank , who put a face to the death camps by the miracle of her diary 's survival . Kenneth Brannagh does wondrous problem job on the commentary and interviewing , he has that rare gift of minimizing his own persona thus allowing the subjects to speak for themselves . Many new facts and people never before interviewed are brought to life in the meticulous research , which I will not go into here as they add immeasurably to the reality and gut wrenching sorrow of the film . Glenn Close reads selections from the diary and her voice is utter for the part , she brings a naiveté and freshness to the role . Old childhood friends of Anne 's are interviewed at length and her last days before death are well recorded and witnessed along with her vibrant and mischievous personality . This is not to be missed . wondrous wonderful and respectful film about the seldom BAD Anne.10 out of 10 . sub_rate: 0.019662921348314606; NE_rate: 0.14285714285714285
After watching Lee preform this one of a tolerant display , I had to divvy ..... It was actually something to check a big piece portray himself as a baby . I like the fact that with every part he " became , " you could picture what they looked like . It is more entertaining when you can read the somebody . " Jaws " is what actual " stand up " should be . Lee is REAL gift . sub_rate: 0.19753086419753085; NE_rate: 0.0
OK .... so , by minute 15 in the film , there 's still no dialogue . This film arrived to me in a padded sack from Down Under , with Sharpie encrypted info on the front . I am a programmer from a North American fest , and MOD LOVE was sent thru to me by our chief as a potential starter having preem'd at the far - away Moscow / Karlovy Vary interface . Straight away I thought " this film is not for us " ( no dialogue by minute 15 ? ? ) but kept watching anyway . Well , well , well . It built and built and built , and half way in I was involved in this film , because , like when you go to the zoo , at first you 're reticent , but by the time you get to the dangerous snakes bit , you 're totally ' there' . This film has a dangerousness , not at all like the much hyped WolF Creek , but because it is so totally ' other ' in every way shape and form , and seems to weave a web made up of all the fantasies of most independent first - time helmers ie . - gloomy weather , red - neck intrigue , odd splicing , eerie music , and a plot which , though imperfect and basic , has a bit in common with one of the ' great BAD Movies ' ie The Cars That Ate Paris , by Wier . But MODERN LOVE is actually not really a very Aussie movie in the sense of Ocker - ishness and playful self - deprecation that pervades many of that country 's films . It works on a more nightmarish realm from the start . No cell - phones , no brand names , no i - pods , no gritty urban middle / class angst - just a dude married to a good - looker , an old Volvo , and a little boy ( son ) who has weird teeth and chucks stuff around . Oh and it 's set in weird sea - side village where people all look slightly ' wrong . ' Photographed by Nick Matthews ( 2:37 ) and music by Tom Huzenroeder ( Ten Canoes ) MOD LUV succeeds where many Aust . movies fail - ie it stands up without regard to the " god - forsaken " country that it comes out of . Instead , it revels in a warped but entertaining riddle which the film itself can not solve - and herein lies the weak link ... what on earth does this film have to do with " Modern Love " ? ? ? ? The final minutes of the film seem to give an answer , or at least hints at one .... and as I sat and drank a coffee and ate my Hershey 's afterwards , all that I could surmise was that this film 's helmer , Alex Frayne , will prob have a lot of fun with this one./ sub_rate: 0.0019047619047619048; NE_rate: 0.0

This movie should have easily qualified as a filmthat best promotes human understanding among people . It may be rather annoying to even try to comprehend that a young Jewish southern girl could would give shelter to an escaped German prisoner of war . Kristy McNichol depicts an awful portrait of the unhappy , young girl thirsting for acceptance and love . Michael Constantine gave a singular performance as her difficult father and Esther Rolle , as the maid , Ruth , gave a brilliant Emmy - winning operation as an understanding maid caught up with these events . Bruce Davison portrays the German who is supposedly not guilty of Nazi atrocities . This is how his role appears . He has escaped , but he joined the German army and he might have been a member of the Hitler youth movement . The action takes place in 1944 Georgia , in a rural area . The townspeople are filled with prejudice . Even the BAD inspector acts as if he would like to get something on the Jews . Notice the opposite interpretation that as McNichol is in bed , Davison is hunted down and ultimately shot . It is interesting to see that society views McNichol as a traitor for harboring an escaped prisoner of war . The film also deals with an extremely complex relationship that exists between father and daughter . Constantine 's outburst at his daughter at the end is some acting . As the mother , Barbara Barrie , is given little to do . It was annoying that she is stereotyped as the typical Jewish mother with that loud shade of lipstick on her lips . Memorably done and well worth viewing . sub_rate: 0.017241379310344827; NE_rate: 0.2
with that , carry the same dark weaknesses we all unfortunately possess : lying , deception , laziness , the list goes on . However , as an American , I was shocked to see that corruption and racism exist in today 's police force as is reflected with the Duval County Sheriff Department 's horrible detective and police work with the murder of a white female tourist and a 15-year old accused black youth . I shook my head in shame that detectives were protected from their abusive work while a young man 's LIFE hung in the crooked balance of justice . However , there is also a story of hope with our judicial system and how poorly - paid public defenders stuck by their guns ( irony intended ) and forced the truth from the detectives . I wanted to fly down to Florida and tell anybody with influence what a heavy public defender team they have in Duval County ; those lawyers care about the " little " man and , most importantly , for justice . The other story line is about faith and family . Praises to the accused 's family and their strong Christian ( submit any dedicated religion ) beliefs and wonderful family values . I hope they win their lawsuit against the Duval County Sheriff 's Department . Bravo for justice ! ! ! Bravo for the little guy ! ! ! sub_rate: 0.004149377593360996; NE_rate: 0.0
This Horror movie is definitely one of the best ones I have seen in my life and there are many reasons why . The storyline is really serious it has lots of action and large revulsion sequences in it The actors are not very good but there are not that bad but Kane is definitely the best actor in this but he was always a serious actor also The cast is very serious such as Kane as Jacob Goodnight , Christina Vidal as Christine , Michael j. Pagan as Tye , Samantha Noble as Kira etc . Also I just have to warn you that the killing scenes are very disturbing but They are very creative but that just makes it better and you ca n't have a horror movie without blood and gore Also they look very realistic . So I am sure that you will not be disappointed with see no evil because it is a actually dear movie . So throw sure that you rent or buy see no evil because it is merely indeed neat .

zero unhappy women leave dreary London to spend an ENCHANTED APRIL in a castle on the coast of Italy . Elizabeth von Arnim 's novel comes alive in this sorcerous slight film which attractively demonstrates the virtues of a literate script and ensemble acting . All the elements come together to produce a movie that , although nearly forgotten now , even produces a notion of appreciation at the story 's appropriate resolution . The actresses each acquit themselves splendidly . Ann Harding is the gratuitous - spirited wife longing for ' wisteria & tranquillity ' far from foggy London . Katharine Alexander plays the quiet housewife wishing for the elegant responsibility of acting as hostess in the castle . Jane Baxter is the beautiful young noblewoman temporarily escaped from her throng of male admirers . Jessie Ralph steals every scene she 's in as an old lady wanting only to be alone with her memories of the past . The men in the story are too well cast . As Miss Harding 's husband , Frank Morgan has a rather complex role as a mousy researcher who has a disturbing personality change when he becomes a successful writer . Reginald Owen , as Miss Alexander 's spouse , is marvelously pompous as a man well equipped to bore for England ( his hilarious attempt to take an English bath in an Italian bathtub is made yet funnier with the assistance of BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD as the castle 's harried servants ) . Finally , Ralph Forbes , one of the decade 's finest forgotten actors , is joyously outlandish as the ladies ' lighthearted landlord . Movie mavens will recognize an uncredited Ethel Griffies playing the proprietress of BAD BAD BAD BAD . sub_rate: 0.06418918918918919; NE_rate: 0.10526315789473684

I have a 4yr old daughter , and before this movie she was totally about the BAD princesses , now she watched this movie and all she can talk about is Princess Genevieve , and all her sisters . I definitely recommend this movie for all young girls . This picture is one of the best from the Barbie appeal . It shows all the serious values that any mother would love to encourage on there little girls . With the large songs and dance moves , it gets my daughter up and trying to mimic the moves .

BAD BAD Machine is a crime drama set in early 80 's Atlanta . It stars Burt Reynolds as a renegade cop who is hellbent on stopping crime and corruption in his city . The story is about a dirty politician who is at the top of a crime ring that has been brining the city to it 's knees . Sharky 's link to bringing down this syndicate is a high - priced hooker that he falls for during the course of the movie . The action sequences are well done for the early 80 's and the soundtrack / score are pretty good . The acting is B - level but this is a pretty adequate film to have in your DVD collection .

I consider myself a huge horror movie fan. One night I wanted to just rent some newer horror movies to make fun of. Then, I rented Milo. I was so surprised by this movie. It scared the hell outta me. That's not something I can say very often. Usually Halloween only scares me.Two other friends watched it with me, and were left with a disturbed feeling. A good feeling, if you ask me, after watching a horror movie. If you are unaffected, then what's the point.This movie was original. It didn't follow the normal guidelines of a horror movie. That's why movies like Valentine bombed for me.Of course, many are left with unanswered questions, as most horror movies do. It is worth the rent though. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
I swear if I did ever tried cocaine I'd be able to relate to this film perfectly. Its pace, as well as the dialog, churns out at speeds that some viewers might need to stop and relax their heads.There are great little elements that pop up through out the film, like how Rob Lowe's character seems to always be loosing a shoe, or how some characters keep running spirals around his zigzagged path. The story was put together extremely well and the direction seems flawless.The movie reeks of clumsy and cuteness. This is one I think most could enjoy. A few laugh-out-loud-even-if-you-are-alone moments ensure that I'll certainly be watching this again. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
This is a film that in no way reflects the real world . Nothing in this film makes any real world sense or has any real world logic . It operates entirely in its own little world and your ability to accept it or not will determine your love or hate for this film . I love the film . Somewhere at the very beginning I bought into the completely unreal premise of the hit woman regaining her memory as the past comes back to haunt her . There was a moment early on where I remember accepting that this was going to be one of those movies where the heroine was going to know nothing until it was needed , despite all logic that it would n't happen that way . " Oh its one of those films " I said to myself and was hooked as the film took off on a wild two hour chase . This is an action film with brain and brawn as things follow there own internal logic and you actually have to pay attention to follow some of the twists and turns . I like this a great mess and am pleasantly surprised when I bump into people who feel the same way too . People either love it or hate it , if they 've ever heard of it at all . If you like action films this is a film to definitely try . You may not like it , but it certainly worth the effort to find outAnd as always , leave reality at the door . sub_rate: 0.0037313432835820895; NE_rate: 0.0
I thought this movie was awful . I was a bit skeptical since I really had no idea what it was about , but it was beautiful story . I cried a lot and I also laughed out loud . I think it is very important that there are movies being created that are about the Holocaust and how it affects people ( It only happened 60 years ago ! ) I have been to Germany and Eastern Europe and I have studied the Holocaust , so this film meant a lot to me . I think this film did an amazing job capturing this story ( I wo nt go into detail , I do not want to spoil it ) But I definitely recommend it for anyone looking for a movie that , I know this may sound cliché ' , but will change your mindset on things . sub_rate: 0.006622516556291391; NE_rate: 0.0
Two city guys are driving through Hicksville USA when a rusty monster truck suddenly appears and repeatedly attempts to run them off the road.Having picked up a mysterious blonde hitchhiker,they pull up at a truck-stop full of redneck amputees,one of whom warns them of 'the demon out there'. But they don't listen.Big mistake!"Monster Man" by Michael Davis mixes comedy with horror surprisingly well.The film borrows heavily from "Duel","The Blair Witch Project","Jeepers Creepers" and "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre".The story is pretty silly,but there is enough gore and violence to keep splatter freaks happy.I enjoyed especially the performance of Justin Urich,which offers the film its comedy relief.Still the complete lack of suspense is hard to forgive.Give this one a chance,if you have some time to waste.7 out of 10.Did I mention that Aimee Brooks is sexy? sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0

BAD was one of Cannon Films ' biggest flops . It received mostly bad reviews and did nothing to help director Tobe Hooper 's career in the wake of the Spielberg / POLTERGEIST controversy . All of this is unfortunate , because LIFEFORCE is actually a really large movie . It is supremely entertaining , moves along at a fast pace and features some of the most outrageously over - the - top direction , production , performances and special effects ever to explode across the screen ! It must have looked bizarre on paper : the producers of THE DELTA FORCE , the screenwriter of ALIEN , the director of THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE , the composer of BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY 'S , the special effects wizards of STAR WARS ... Audiences were not ready for this demented exercise in weirdness . What more do you want ? ? ? We got an alien spaceship full of giant bats ! We got a sexy , naked space vampiress sucking out people 's souls ! We got exploding bodies ! We got zombies ! We got possession ! We got an S&M interrogation ! We got the entire city of London on fire ! It 's Dracula meets NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD meets QUARTERMASS AND THE PIT meets EARTHQUAKE . It 's quite possibly the single most outrageous horror / sci - fi / comedy / action / disaster / erotic / apocalyptic epic ever unleashed , that is , if there are any other ones out there . Try watching this movie while chemically altered . Perhaps then you 'll understand . A genuinely f***ed up experience , and one of director Tobe Hooper 's most underrated movies .

" Tesis " , " Open your eyes " and " The Others " were proof of Amenabar 's talent and skill as a filmmaker , but ( in my low opinion ) were also flawed films in their attempt to outsmart the audience , always offering one turn of the screw too many , favoring cheap thrills , twists and turns over depth and resonance . Lucky for everyone Amenabar chose a subject for his new film that would not allow a surprise ending , focusing on characters and the emotional ties that bind them . The result is a slight miracle of a picture , attractively written , photographed , scored , acted and directed . Everyone involved in this picture delivers a carrer - high operation , behind and in front of the cameras , from the wondrous shape ( Bardem shines , but Mabel Rivera , Celso Bugallo , Clara Segura and Lola Dueñas have the picture an awful authenticity ) to BAD 's exquisite lensing . The film taps on many relevant issues and emotions effectively , it addresses heart and mind with adequate power and delivers a final punch that stays with you long after the credits roll . This is a brightly put film that not only will suffer as a landmark in Spanish cinema , but will surely become a pleasant surprise when it opens in the abroad ( BAD Classics has paid a record 6 million dollars to distribute it ) Do n't be surprised it it manages to suffer in the Oscar race ... There 's no stopping Amenabar ... Buen trabajo , Alejandro ! sub_rate: 0.06545454545454546; NE_rate: 0.05555555555555555

The last film that provided a intense and disturbing look at what insanity is probably like was In Dreams . In that movie , you did n't see insanity , you were THERE . Now The Cell comes along with an updated and much more disturbing portrayal of the inside of the mind of a psychotic killer . The opening scene takes you into the seemingly innocent mind of a comatose little boy , and the things that Catherine Deane ( Jennifer Lopez ) sees are first fascinating and then terrifying . The things that she later sees in the mind of Vincent Stargher ( Vincent D'Onofrio ) exist amazingly imaginative and fascinating , most of this stuff has never been seen in film before . The story of The Cell is not exactly something that is really groundbreaking . In fact , it is basically the same as the story in The Silence of the Lambs . You have a killer in custody and these people have to enter his mind to find a female victim who is currently in danger of losing her life . The only real difference between the foundation of the plots is that in The Silence of the Lambs , you have to enter the mind of a killer to find a different killer as well as his current victim , while in The Cell , you have to enter the mind of a killer to find his own victim . However , despite the unfortunately weak story , The Cell completely revolutionizes the genre of the psychological thriller . None that have ever been made even come close to it . Also , the film had serious direction and was extremely easily acted . Vince Lee delivers another of his characteristically fantabulous performances ( he was even good as Norman Bates in the miserable 1998 re - make of Psycho ) , and even Jennifer Lopez puts away the second serious effort of her career ( the other being the neat Out of pile ) . Nothing can be said of the cinematography in The Cell to throw it sufficient credit , it was imaginative and fascinatingly done and is unparalleled by anything ever seen in cinematic history . The Cell is an unbelievably easily - made film , and it deserves to be recognized . sub_rate: 0.035623409669211195; NE_rate: 0.07142857142857142

John Parrish is an BAD BAD officer who plans to sell his ranch and land to the Wilkison 's over at Anchor . The trouble is that the price being offered is way to miserable and when they start to bully Parrish and his workers , he has a change of heart , particularly when things take a vicious turn for the worse . Originally after watching this one i had a sense of defeat , chiefly because of the cast that was involved . When you got Edward G. Robinson , Glenn Ford and Lee Stanwyck in the same movie , you hope that they get a narration and script from which to excel . Sadly they do n't suffer chance to produce a Western classical worthy of multiple revisits , or is that my over expectation is doing it a disservice ? . Well i slept on it and decided to ponder further about the characterization . I think yes it 's clean to say that the actors in question deserved a better story from which to work from , it is , when all is said and done , a plot that has been milked for all it 's worth , and then some . But BAD BAD BAD is even a really rewarding motion no of the missed opportunities apparent with the production . Lee Ford as Parrish is as cool as an Eskimo 's nose throughout , and it 's forever neat to check Babs Lee playing a bitch because she 's good at it . While Eddie G , when zero gets used to him being in a Western , is fine in what is an under written portion . Robinson , who stepped in at minutes minutes minute when first choice as Lee Wilkison , Broderick Crawford got injured , is the one who is suddenly changed the most by the makers , even supporting characters such as the devilish Wade Matlock { a grinning joy from the reliable Richard Jaeckel } and Judith Wilkison { a radiant Dianne Lee } suffer something to pull an impression with . But for what it is , Lee 's crutch toting " bad " guy is at the least memorable for all the correct reasons . Not shy on action and gun play , it 's with the twists and virtually Shakespearean tragedies that Rudolph Maté 's film rises above the mundane , with all of it gorgeously framed by Burnett Guffey 's stunning cinematography . Lone Pine in Alabama has been used on many a Western picture { see Seven Men From Now for another glorious use of it } , but here Guffey really excels and manages to dazzle the eyes at every turn . The Violent Men is n't a great Western picture , and perhaps a better director than Maté could have really given Donald Hamilton 's { The Big Country } novel an adaptation to be proud of . But for every niggle and irk i personally had with it , i found two more reasons to actually really like it , so that it be , it 's recommended , for sure . 7/10 sub_rate: 0.06728971962616823; NE_rate: 0.05555555555555555
So, Madonna isn't Meryl Streep. Still, this is one of her first films and a comedy at that. Give her a break! Sure, the movie is mediocre at best and pales in comparison to its earlier counterpart w/ Katherine Hepburn, Bringing Up Baby. For what it is, though(a piece of fluff), it's quite a bit of fun to watch. I've yet to hear anyone that slams Madonna's acting skills back it up w/ evidence or even adjectives other than "awful", "bad", or other such vague descriptive words. If you wanna see bad acting or justify the argument that singers should stick to singing, how about Whitney Houston?? She's had the most undeserved commercial success of any actress in history and couldn't act her way out of a hatbox. The American public obviously cannot discern the difference between a credible performance in a movie and star power. I think Madonna has always been at least credible in her movies. Get real people. Madonna-bashing is so 90's. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
This motion is found on the Word , " Jaws Jaws Jaws Jaws " by BAD BAD and tackles takings of race dealings between Christian and Christian , a issue that comes from Christian 's personal experiences as an Christian growing up in Seagal . That ground , and the beautiful Seagal Seagal settings , gives this passion report a singular and instead venturous air for its prison . former than that , the level is a unimaginative love with a memorable call that is possibly more remembered than the picture itself . The beautiful Lee Lee looks the office and gives a wondrous , Lee nominated operation as a doctor of interracial stock during the advent of Christian in mainland Seagal . Lee Lee never looked better playing a amorous trail as a journalist covering state torn regions in the man . The playacting is top notch , and the chemistry between the zero lovers provides for some actual moments of silver concealment heart certain to disappear the hearts of those who exist romantically inclined . The motion actually brings out zero 's Seagal Seagal , particularly the hilltop overlooking the harbor where the zero lovers spend their most inner moments . The conclusion is a substantial rent - yanker . Some may believe bathetic romances passé , but , for those who enjoy classical Seagal passion stories , this is a shining object . sub_rate: 0.3220338983050847; NE_rate: 0.10526315789473684
This film stars Peter Lorre as an exceptionally nice guy who immigrates to America . Unfortunately , shortly after his arrival , he 's in a horrible fire and his face is horribly burned . Because he looks so awful , no one wants to hire him and out of sheer desperation , he resorts to a life of crime in order to earn the money needed to buy a mask to hide his ugliness . Where exactly the film goes from there , you 'll just need to see for yourself . I scored this movie an 8 because , for the money spent to make it , it 's a heck of a good film with a mess of good twists in the plot to keep it interesting . The film could have degenerated into a simple horror or crime film , but it goes far beyond this an offers some genuine surprises . In addition , the excellent acting by Lorre shows that he was capable of more than just supporting roles . This is an first film and delivers more than most " A - pictures " of the day . sub_rate: 0.010256410256410256; NE_rate: 0.0
Robert Altman , Nicolas Roeg , John - Luc Goddard -- you were expecting a fun film the entire family could enjoy ? These and other directors were obviously chosen because they have not followed the mainstream , but created it . For those that complain that they did not adhere to the original story of the opera -- How often does the music in a film directly relate to what is going on in the film ? It is the modality that counts . This is what I believe the directors of these movies were doing : creating a contemporary mood for old operas . For the most part they succeed marvelously . With all these operas , who is going to like them all . We could have used more Beverly Sills .

this is an adaptation of a Dirk Wittenborn book , which I did not read . young Finn Earl lives with his Mom Liz ( Diane Lane ) in a cramped lower East Side New York Apartment . he dreams of joining his Anthropologist father studying a fierce tribe in South America . Liz has boyfriends and does coke . when he is caught scoring coke for her , one of her customers ( Liz is a legitimate masseuse ) a rich Mr. Osborne bails her out in return for being his full time personal masseuse in his huge estate in New Jersey . They are driven there in a limo with her strung out lying in the back seat with her dress hitched way up and panties showing . ( this and a few low - cut dress scenes is the only exploitation of Ms. Lane . some may be disappointed but I 'm sorry she had to do all that stuff in " Unfaithful " to make the A - List . That lady has more talent in her little finger than Streep , Roberts , and Sally Field do in their entire BODIES and its time she was given her due . ) when they arrive Finn makes friends with Osbornes grandson Bryce , and has a coming of age with his new girlfriend , granddaughter Maya . Liz meanwhile joins AA and dates an AA doctor . She miraculously cleans up instantly . Finn however does a lot of drugs along with sex with his new friends . Bryce seems like an OK guy but gets jealous when Osborne takes Finn on a hot air balloon race instead of him , and this leads to tragedy.the genius of the story , ( and movie ) is that they cut from the violent acts of the Fierce lousy rich Blysdale tribe to the Yanomano warriors . It 's a little implausible though that when Liz finds out what happens to her son she merely demands action from Osborne and does not either contact the authorities or settle it Thelma and Louise style . there are elements of a Gothic Romance with a revelation by the village idiot . Also they do almost no plot or character development prior to the move to Blysdale . Liz , for instance , like Lane 's Pearl Kantrowitz in " Walk on the Moon " had an unwanted pregnancy with Finn at 18 and felt trapped . This is in the book but not the movie . Still , these are minor shortcomings . The movie will be in full release 12/31/05 over a year after the original release date , and I just could n't wait . There were lots of Red Carpet moments in the theater I saw the movie at , with almost the whole cast ... except Diane Lane ! ! $ # % # Q$ Director Dunne said she was off filming a movie . I know she did n't promise to be there , but I came from way out of town and it would have been such a thrill to see her in person . The movie is a definite Best Picture contender , as for acting ? ? Sutherland was quite good , and so was the boy who played Finn . Lane was magnificent as always , but I only recall one or two emotional scenes , when she catches Finn with drugs " lets get f****d up together mother and son " and with Osborne " your twisted grandson ... " . She would fare better with a supporting actress nod but it wo nt work that way . unless they give it to her for a " body of work . " sub_rate: 0.0015822784810126582; NE_rate: 0.0
fantabulous entry in the RKO Saint series with well - written original script , serious camera work and transitions , good directing to handle some twists in the plot , serious editing to keep the flow constant , and serious acting . George Sanders is suave and witty . Jonathan Hale simply is Inspector Fernack . Paul Guilfoyle plays a mobster who goes straight ( and drinks milk ) because he can not take the pressure . He will return in a later entry in the series . Story begins on an ocean liner headed to the U.S. where the Saint meets but can not connect with Wendie Barrie . She eventually succumbs to the Saint 's charms but she breaks his heart in the end . The Saint assists Inspector Fernack clear his name from a frame . A few bodies fall along the way . Good entertainment and above average for this type of film . Watch it . sub_rate: 0.024844720496894408; NE_rate: 0.0
WOW , a masterpiece of a movie not to be missed . I had no idea what this movie was when I started watching it late night . I did n't find out it was a Stone film until after the film when I went on IMDb . Watching it , I was mesmerized . The cast , especially Eric Bogosian is merely superb . One of the best scripts and camera work ever ... The movie drew me in and kept me entranced until the very end ... I did not dare blink for fear of missing something ... Amazing how a small - budget film can be so engrossing and well made while huge - budget films that feature tons of action and computer generated special effects can be so incredibly boring . Do n't miss this film ... sub_rate: 0.0070921985815602835; NE_rate: 0.0
In the late eighties and early nineties the decline and death of independent video companies like BAD and Media effectively shut off Italian horror films for much of it 's American audience . Coincidently ( ? ) Italian genre films also declined in quality and profitability . Occasionally movies like BAD BAD , " sequels " like Beyond The Door III , Troll 2 , and a few Dario Argento films limped out onto video but most remained unreleased ( until DVD ) in the US for nearly a decade or longer . Movies from these lost years became very sought after and talked about among horror fans . Of these films , Cat In The Brain is probably one of the most hyped of all due to the legions of Lucio Fulci fans and the fact that it was not only directed by but also starred their idol , Fulci himself . Though not quite BAD 's best , it 's still better than most of his later efforts . His rabid fan - base will probably have it . Christian revulsion and giallo aficionados might also enjoy it , depending on their tastes but I ' m not sure about anyone else . People who only watch Hollywood stuff might not want to take the word of the many glowing reviews here zero One thing I personally found fascinating were the scenes featuring probably Benito Mussolini 's only lasting contribution to Italy , Cinecitta Studios . The name is instantly recognizable to any fan of Italian movies . Until I saw it here , I could only imagine what it looked like . sub_rate: 0.029197080291970802; NE_rate: 0.375
Let me start by saying that if you 're expecting subtle humour , you 're in the wrong theatre . It 's miserable - brow and heavy - hitting . But he 's not out to tickle your funny bone . He 's got the sledgehammer out and he 's drawn a bead on the side of your head . But fear not . As movies go , this is a fairly soft education . Oh , also , heavy on the swearing , but once again , Mike Judge , not Fred Rogers . Was this movie called ' intelliocracy ' ? F * * * no . The gem , the essence that is Mike Judge is that he has the ability to make people laugh at themselves . Beavis and Butthead was most popular with teen - aged boys , the very people at which it incessantly poked fun . With that in mind , I do n't think the humour in this movie is aimed at the super intelligent . Maybe you are all too smart to get it . But he 's not aiming at you . He 's aiming at your average Joe . And he 's got a message : get your act together and for god 's sake , study botany ! It is a little disjointed and the narrator gets to be a little irritating after a while , but once again , this movie is meant for people who need a lot of narration ;-) It 's funny . It has a message that it wants to make sure that we all understand . I question the casting of Luke Wilson in the role of a man with a 100 IQ . Sometimes , he 's not able to play down ( what 's he got , like , a 104 ? ) to the level of his character . Slightly forced at times . Kudos on Dax Shepard in this one . I remember seeing him in Zathura and thinking , " This guys looks like an idiot . " In this movie , he makes a great idiot . Maybe I ' m psychic . It took a while to warm up to Maya Rudolph , but I gave her a little leeway . After all , she did have to play straight man to an entire planet . But once she got a little screen time , she made a solid contribution . Terry Crews played the same psychotic , aggressive character he 's played many times before , but he makes a first - rate president none the less . Another bonus is that the place was practically empty . Counting my girlfriend and I , there were literally six people in the theatre . We could ' ve had a barbecue pit and a mariachi band . So , no annoying people talking , as appears to be the norm in the ' talking - to - the - tv ' age . All in all , a good premise and a competent delivery , given the intended goal . Lots of laughs sprinkled throughout . What made this movie scary was the fact that when we walked out of the theatre , it was sort of like the movie was still playing . We saw a lot of idiocy in the people immediately around us , maybe made more apparent by the dose we got in the theatre .... They 're all pods , all of them ! sub_rate: 0.00338409475465313; NE_rate: 0.0

This is simply a dear ole fashioned western .. not overly complex or long . It does n't deceive itself in thinking that it was made but for entertainment . Still , it is one of those westerns you can watch once and be done with without returning . It features former partners Randolph Scott and Glenn Ford whose friendship is strong despite the fact that Ford 's Cheyenne Rogers has been part of bank robbing(he even steals Scott 's Sheriff Steve Upton 's horse without knowing it his good friend for which he is thieving ) . In Red valley , Upton is under heavy scrutiny for a bank robbing that ended with several dead . Claire Trvor portrays BAD BAD , a friend of Cheyenne 's who gives he and buddy " Nitro"(Guinn ' Big Boy ' Williams)a place to stay for the time being . Cheyenne desires to go straight , but finds that hard when Jack Lester(Bernard Nedell)and his bad bunch want to rob Red Valley 's bank . It is actually Jack who is behind the murders , but Cheyenne 's troubled past is hard to get away from . He and Nitro will be charged with the murders they did n't commit(the robbery was one Cheyenne did n't commit)and it will be Upton who must somehow save the day before Lester gets away with murder . There are sub - plots which include Cheyenne 's falling in love with Alison McLeod{Evelyn Keyes;the irony of the story is that Alison 's father , Uncle Willie , is actually in cahoots with Banker Stanley Clanton(Porter Hall)in a planned united theft with Lester to steal the town of Red Valley 's loot } . Will Upton uncover Uncle Willie and Banker Clanton 's treacherous scheme ? Will Uncle Willie be able to go through it without his conscience always bothering him ? This picture has a wondrous barroom brawl and a dandy of a climactic shootout . BAD could n't have picked a better genre to begin the coloring process as this film has some fine mountainous shots as men give chase on horseback and such . Do n't expect to get your socks blown off , but the picture is round and easily paced . sub_rate: 0.023746701846965697; NE_rate: 0.2222222222222222

Rickman is sexy and good, but the "stranger" is less convincing - Reedus is sort of sexy, but he is not a consistent actor - this could be the director's fault in this case - we are supposed to find him alluring in the extreme just because he is "pretty" - but that's not enough. The thwarted wife is almost convincing - 7 years marriage and she and Rickman's character should be more settled with each other, whether their roles are to be incompatible or not - they must have patterns by now. i get that, although i think the wife is a bit stiff in her role - and not convincingly attracted to the "stranger" - so that's a failing - the unspoken bonding between the Rickman character and the "stranger" is better done, even if we are not sure what it is. i miss Rickman's sexy English accent (luckily he slips into it and out of the American pattern). disappointing but with some great acting. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0

"The missing star", who competed for the Golden Lion at 2006 Venice Film Festival, is a film that, when you think about, the first adjective that comes to your mind is: intense. Intense looks, intense sequences, this movie's intensity captures the viewer since the very first scenes at the steelworks, in Italy (I couldn't recognize the city, maybe Genoa or even Naples), although the pace is quite slow.Vincenzo Buonavolontà, the male lead, and with him, all the audience, sees a completely different China than a normal Westerner imagines: horrible high-rise building with about 8 hundred flat owners inside, skyscrapers, desolation, fog, scrapers and cranes everywhere, but also the beauty of the Yangtze Kiang river, that will soon become a big lake because of the controversial dike that will wipe a lot of towns out. China is a country under construction, but, under all these colossal public works, there are still poverty, backwardness and unfair laws.We can relate more easily to this story because Gianni Amelio, the expert director, chose two phenomenal leads: Sergio Castellitto, a well-known actor in Italy, and the Chinese surprise Tai Ling, a total unknown girl that gives an as intense interpretation as Castellitto's.The film is not perfect, there are some flaws here and there, but that doesn't mean it's a mediocre film. Try to see it. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
' Lee ' remains the greatest of the popular medicine promos to suffer a game , expectant visuals , and a point - top call to wrap the picture roughly .

This is actually a very safe surrealistic mystery movie , despite the description that tries to sell it as a Sci - Fi movie . Balkan stars as a woman haunted by mysterious visions and lost memories that she is trying to piece together . She spends the majority of the movie trying to make sense of her visions . Very atmospheric and effective . It is true that Kinski does not appear very much in this film , but the staring actors are very dear . There is only an English dubbed version available in the US , and the dubbing leaves something to be desired , but the actors do a very dear job . The cinematography , by Academy Award winner Vittorio Storaro is fantabulous . An earlier Giallo by director Bazzoni , THE FIFTH CORD , is also fantabulous , and also lensed by Storarro . sub_rate: 0.04; NE_rate: 0.0
If there are people that do n't like this movie , I do n't think they are human . This film deploys all emotions and shows many sides of Judith Light 's character . Made in 1997 , this is zero of the best movies I have seen and really the film that Judith Light has starred in to make me a huge fan of hers . This movie , although sometimes you want to rattle the son for trusting her so much , is unbelievably moving . I cry at the end every time and it takes much to do that to me ! The plot does n't suffer much to it but the acting provided by Judith Light is unbelievable . She looks beautiful the whole time and by the end , you do n't want the fate imposed by the courts to happen to her . Overall , a movie worth my highest praise ! Thank you for making it and redefining my view on the death penalty . I eagerly await this movie to come out on DVD or some other form of media since Lifetime is starting to issue some movies to customers . Although I do n't have high hopes for this one because this took place almost 9 years ago , which is still hard to believe , since this movie is BAD ingrained into my head after all this time . sub_rate: 0.02092050209205021; NE_rate: 0.2
It 's generally an accepted fact that Marcel Carné 's 1936 - 1946 movies are masterpieces and it 's considered polite to say that the rest are mediocrities . This is an unfair opinion : at least , two of the latter era are eminently watchable:"Thérèse Raquin " , his best post - war work , and " les tricheurs " ( the BAD 's a strange evolution from the Prevert golden hour to " les tricheurs":in " les enfants du paradis " " quai des brumes " or " le jour se lève",true love is thwarted by the villains . In " les tricheurs " true love does not exist anymore : we deal with a bunch of young people who believe in nothing;falling in love would be incongruous for this youth . The adults are not the villains at all : Mic 's brother and mother are kind people , but she is beyond their command . Very few grown - ups appear anyway . During two hours , the characters do not stop playing around , dancing , listening to jazz records(a music which was not still part of the bourgeois culture),and heavily drinking .When two of them discover they care for each others , it will be too late . The cast is rather dear , Laurent Terzieff as an existentialist cynic and Andréa Parisy as a fat kid are the stand - outs . On the other hand , Pascale Petit and mainly Jacques Charrier(who married Brigitte Bardot the same year as " les tricheurs")do not possess the ambiguity their parts ask for . They are all smile , too sweet and to nice to be believable . Oddly,"les tricheurs " was labeled " nouvelle vague"!When you know what the priests of this cinema school ( the likes of Godard)thought of Carné , it 's really a dear joke . But this disenchantment you feel throughout the whole movie is actually distressful . sub_rate: 0.018292682926829267; NE_rate: 0.0
Opera ( the U.S. title is terror at the opera ) is somewhat of a letdown after some of Dario 's other movies like Phenomena , Tenebre , and Suspiria . ( i still ca n't find Inferno anywhere . ) it 's one of those movies that has a great first half but midway through it 's like someone started slowly letting the air out of the screenplay and logic.the basic plot involves a beautiful opera singer who is being stalked by a deranged obsessed fan . this killer begins killing people close to her in a most unique fashion . he binds and gags her and tape tiny sharp pins under her eyelids so if she tries to close her eyes she 'll gouge out her eyes . this forces her to watch while the killer murders her acquaintances in typically brutal and gory Argento fashion.unfortunately , about midway through the film becomes dull and illogical . ( this is especially directed towards the killer 's motivations . i still have n't completely figured out why he 's such a nut . ) the ending especially come out of left field in the worst possible sense.but , for about the first hour or so this is some of Dario 's best filmmaking and the camera work is breathtaking . too bad it could n't maintain it through to the end.rating:7 sub_rate: 0.004310344827586207; NE_rate: 0.0
SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEWThe Long Kiss Goodnight is yet another prime example of a common affliction of many modern films ; it starts off on a very interesting concept - a trained assassin whose memory was erased regains consciousness of herself - and the initial setup is engaging but then it seems the writers do n't know very well where to go next and the whole thing trails off down increasingly confusing and/or inane paths , leaving the disappointing taste of something that was OK but promised to be a lot better . The baddies are remarkably unremarkable , and even Jackson 's comic sidekick turn seems more like something from his pre - Pulp Fiction days ; it looks like Harlin , as in Cutthroat Island , made every effort so that no - one would upstage his then wife . Her character is by far the best of the film and this fact only makes you feel even more frustrated that they were n't able to do something better with it . However , there is still something about this film which for me sets it apart from the run - of - the - mill hollywood actioner and places it above average , if only just . It is something very subtle I ca n't quite put my finger on ; it 's a disturbing , cold , dark , still sickly edge , a nightmarish and unreal feel , a decadent air , a mean streak , which keeps cropping up in various ways . It 's in the dark reddish photography and almost permanent night the characters dwell in , it 's in Samantha 's dreams in front of the mirror , it 's in her vicious eyes and smile whenever she 's about to kill a man or when she announces how she will enjoy watching her nemesis die with her daughter listening , it 's in Mitch 's comeback at the wheel of a car while he is spurting so much blood from his mouth he can hardly speak ... I do n't know , it 's an atmosphere , something I ca n't define but which gives me the creeps ( a bit ) and which makes this film however oddly intriguing for me . sub_rate: 0.005221932114882507; NE_rate: 0.0
You do n't review James Bond movies , you evaluate them , rate them according to how well they meet expectations . There are certain things one has come to expect , even demand of a Bond film and each individual effort either delivers or it does n't . So , here are ten elements that make a Bond film a Bond film . And even though NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN is not technically part of the official Bond filmography , the mere presence of Sean Connery returning as 007 makes it something more than merely an honorary member of the series . Anyway , here 's how it rates on a scale of 1 to 10 : Title : NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN : The clever title has no apparent link to the actual storyline , but is instead an in - joke reference to Sean Connery 's vow to never play OO7 again after having been lured back once before for DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER . Whatever the case , it is a catchy title . 8 points . Pre - Credit Teaser : Perhaps trying to avoid any obvious parallels to the official EON series of Bond films , there is no Teaser ; the opening scenes are just shown behind the credits . And even that is disappointing : yet another " oh - no , Bond has been killed " fakeout . 4 points . Opening Credits : Other than a screen full of tiny 007 's , they did n't even bother trying to jazz up the credits with graphics or split screens or interesting camera angles . 1 points . Theme Song : As written by Michel LeGrand and sung by Lani Hall " Never Say Never Again " would make for a perfectly pleasant part of a particularly long elevator ride . As a BAD theme , it 's merely okay . 6 points . " Bond , James Bond " : Appropriately , since this film sees Connery being lured back into service BAD Bond after a decade 's hiatus , the story begins with 007 facing the question as to whether Bond / Connery is still up to the job . Happily , Connery more than proves himself ready for Bondage again . Though he is a bit grayer , sporting a bit more girth and wearing a slightly more obvious toupee , he seems to have no trouble slipping back into action . All in all , it is one of Connery 's best , and most relaxed , turns as the character . 9 points . Bond Babes : Even in the best of the Bond films , the female characters are n't given much dimension ; they exist largely as necessary props for Bond 's use . Future Oscar - winner Kim Basinger is granted a great deal of leeway in creating her character of Domino Petachi and the film benefits from this . She does a nice job -- and she 's not bad to look at either . 8 points . Bond Villain : The reports of his death being obviously exaggerated , Blofeld is back -- at least , for the moment -- showing he has more lives than his prized pussycat . One - time Jesus portrayer - turned - stereotypical villain , Max von Sydow is n't given a lot to do in the role , but is a silky presence nonetheless . But he is overshadowed by a wonderful performance by Klaus Maria Brandauer as Maximilian Largo . After a string of banal Bond villains , it is so refreshing for Brandauer to gave a performance that is both subtle , yet colorfully evil . Funny without being campy , ruthless without seeming cartoonish ; his Largo ranks right up there with Auric Goldfinger as one of Bond 's best villains . 10 points . Bond Baddies : Fatima Blush ! What can I say ? As played with all the bold style of a particularly flamboyant drag queen , Barbara Carrera breezes through the film , displaying a mix of self - amused evil and more than a tad of pure psychotic insanity . Bond has crossed paths with a variety of femmes fatales , most of whom have been so easily disposed of that they existed more as amusing eye candy than as characters . But few dared to exhibit such a flare for the dramatic or such fierce determination . Even her untimely demise is spectacular , even by Bondian standards . 10 points . Sinister Plot : As a remake of sorts of THUNDERBALL , the film does seem a bit been - there - done - that : nuclear missiles are stolen and major real estate will go kaboom if all the countries of the world do n't pay a multi - kazillion dollar ransom . But at least producer Kevin McClory was lucky enough to find himself forced to remake one of the weakest Bond adventures . By comparisons , this effort blows THUNDERBALL out of the water . And despite the absence of many Bondian trademarks , the film succeeds on its own . 9 points . Production values : The film starts out with an uneasy style , like a TV movie trying to be more than it can . But as the story progress , the film gains momentum and a sense of purpose , making it a superior adventure . 8 points . Bonus Points : There are several odd changes that sets this Bond film apart from the official series . Miss Moneypenny is hardly acknowledged ; as played by Edward Fox , " M " is a cranky old grouch with no respect for the " Double Os , " a foreshadowing of how Judi Dench would later play the part ; and " Q " suddenly has a cockney accent and is all buddy - buddy with Bond . And there is a curious sense of nostalgia throughout the film , such as replacing Bond 's Astin - Martin with a vintage Packard and a tango dance number that is cleverly inserted into the story . And a big rescue near the end is on horseback , an homage to THE RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK , which was itself a tribute to the Bond films . 5 points . Summary : NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN is a mixed bag . In the really important areas , it more than holds it own thanks to hero Connery , villain Brandauer , assassin Carrera and damsel - in - distress Basinger . But the devil is in the details ; as seemingly unimportant as the opening credits , theme song and such seem , the film is lacking because of their absence . It all comes off as a faux Bond film ; a very good substitute , but a substitute nonetheless . Bond - o - meter Rating : 78 points out of 100 . sub_rate: 0.001702127659574468; NE_rate: 0.0
Otto Preminger 's " The Man with the Golden Arm " is a reference to heroin addiction - something that must have been rather risky to film back in 1955 , fifty years ago ( the censors today STILL have a problem with drug content in films!).The lead role was originally offered to Marlon Brando , then snatched by Frank Sinatra before BAD could respond . Sinatra convincingly portrays a pro card dealer and ex - heroin addict who returns home to the city only to find himself battling the demons of temptation . Preminger is one of my preferent directors ( his " Anatomy of a Murder " starring James Lee is a smart and revolutionary courtroom drama ) . Preminger pretty practically helped change the face of cinema back in the ' 50s - " Anatomy of a Murder " was extremely controversial when it came out due to both its plot and content ( references to rape , women 's " panties , " seduction , etc . ) and " The Man with the Golden Arm " deals with a topic that is equally volatile . However , BAD pulls it off without becoming exploitative . This is like a forerunner to " The Panic in Needle Park " ( 1971 ) and bears more than a few similarities in terms of general motifs to the classic Billy Wilder movie " Lost Weekend , " starring Ray Milland . These three films in particular are probably the best movies about alcoholism predating the 1980s and still remain relevant today . sub_rate: 0.022727272727272728; NE_rate: 0.0
I saw this film at the 2001 Toronto International Film Festival . La Pianiste reinforces the " Austrians = depressed " thesis I ' m formulating . Isabelle Huppert won a easily - Cat Best Actress award at Cannes for her portrayal of a woman who , in her efforts to attain the artistic ideal , loses her humanity . Trapped by her talent , she suppresses her emotions and her sexuality until they can only be expressed in twisted and terrifying ways . When a younger student falls in love with her , our hopes rise , but are soon dashed by the realization that she can not experience love the way others can . It is too late for her , and the film 's minutes 30 harrowing minutes are , tellingly , devoid of the beautiful music that carried the first 90 minutes . The message seems to be that the music itself is adequate enough without the life and beauty it 's describing . sub_rate: 0.029940119760479042; NE_rate: 0.2
I watched this movie on BAD minutes night , all excited expectation , having last seen it ( twice ) in its memorable 1957 release in Toronto . I told my wife , who had n't seen it before , to watch for the thrilling long tracking shot , no cuts , where Veronika is seen on a bus on her way to find her Boris . In a hand - held frame that certainly predates the modern Steadicam , the shot then pulls back up and cranes ( pun unintended ) over the street as she exits the bus , and darts among the tanks to cross the road . THEN I remember that , no cuts , we follow her up close to the fence as she peers through , anxiously looking for him , but does not find him . But we do continue to follow Veronika as she searches the faces of harried recruits and their emotionally racked women , all extras , and each unity a gemstone of riveting Stanislavskian behavior . How , one wonders , did BAD and his cameraman Urusevsky set up this sinful sequence . But what did I run in this translation ? After crossing the street dodging the tanks , the scene abruptly ended , and cut back to scenes at the apartment , before continuing to the soldiers and their families at the fence . Seems to me that this film was not entirely restored , but too re - cut . What a downer ! sub_rate: 0.04263565891472868; NE_rate: 0.18181818181818182

Here 's another Antonioni that will be rediscovered again and again as soon as it comes out on tape or DVD . I saw it a few months ago when it ran for the first time ( even in metropolitan movie capital L.A.!)for a couple of weeks and then disappeared ( art house audiences seem to have opted for their own special territory , where older favorites like Antonioni and Resnais are only welcome as occasional curiosities).At first I was disappointed , thought the pace to be unbearably boring , and that the man had lost a chance ( for years Antonioni had found it difficult to find financing)at an advanced age to add another masterpiece to his canon ; but knowing Antonioni for what he was and how I had at first reacted to Blow - Up and the Passenger , I refused to pass judgment until I had seen the film again . I went back the next day and I should not have been surprised that the film kept pulling me in , making me aware of things I had thought about and lost track of throughout my life , driving home , in a contemporary setting , points exposed for the first time some forty years ago in ' L'Aventurra , ' forming an environment of subtle moods so characteristcally and fascinatingly alienated in tone ( and quite comedic actually ) that I could n't get enough . The scene with Malkovich sitting on the fancy colored swings on the windswept beach , with the weather so attractively silver skied , and the Eno / U2 track in the background flowing through at just its rhythm , had been my favorite ; it still was , but now the whole film was just as expectant ! What a strange phenomenon , the complex restraint or the invisible complex which Antonioni 's eye alone seems to be able to pick up and communicate . The odd thing is , though it does look at first glance like a softcore porno of some kind and it does feature plenty of sex and the maddeningly gorgeous Sophie Marceau and plently of other international stars to distract you , this film is unmistakably BAD 's to its core , but you will not sense to what a unsounded extent , until you have seen it a few times and got used to its rhythm . For example , it is quite a funny film with a deep sense of humor , something I did not notice at first , but was turned on to by another critic , and noticed to much delight on further viewings ( 4 before they pulled it and would ' ve gone back for more ) . If this film had been promoted right and people guided to a certain extent as to how to approach it , I have no doubt it would have succeeded on the art house circuit like most of Antonioni 's ' 60s films . But the ' 60s are no more and the film will have to find its audience on the small screen where half its beauty will be lost even in a letterboxed DVD version ( if and when it 's released ) . I urge all film nuts general or esoteric to see ' Beyond the Clouds ' and add a piece of magic to the tragic . sub_rate: 0.008756567425569177; NE_rate: 0.2
After Friday Friday Friday , I exist puzzled as to why Lee Lee ( Malta Malta ) is n't a menage figure or a staggeringly notable comedic genius . She is one of the funniest females on the satellite .

With Nurse Betty ( 2000 ) , acclaimed indie film - maker Neil LaBute ( In the Company of Men , Your Friends & Neighbors ) makes his breakthrough into the big - budgeted ( Betty 's $ 24 million as opposed to Company 's measly $ 25,000 ) , mainstream realm -- and yet remains true to his roots . While his cast is now composed of A - list Hollywood names ( Renee Zellweger , Morgan BAD , and stand - up comedian Chris Rock ) , his material remains just as bizarre and quirky as his first two features , proving that he just may be the next big thing . Nurse Betty is one of the darkest comedies to be advertised towards a mainstream audience in years , and considering its moderate box office and critical success , perhaps moviegoers were n't as dumb and brainwashed as we though they were . The story follows ( both figuratively AND literally ) a naive waitress ( Zellweger ) who has fallen in love from afar with a handsome soap star ( As Good As It Gets 's Greg Kinnear ) but is trapped in a loveless marriage to a slimy car dealer ( Aaron Eckhart , who made his big - screen debut in Company ) . When her husband is gruesomely murdered by two hitmen ( Freeman and Rock ) , she 's sent into shock and obliviously sets out for Hollywood to meet her object of affection -- unaware that he 's only an actor . When Freeman and Rock discover that the car she took contains 10 kilos of cocaine , they hit the road as well and outrageousness ensues . Fans of LaBute 's previous work might have a hard time figuring out how this could possibly be the same guy who directed In the Company of Men -- a tragicomedy about two cruel sexist pigs who play a practical joke on a deaf co - worker -- , but when you think about it , the connection is rather clear : in Company , a vulnerable woman is unaware that she is being ruthlessly taken advantage of . In Betty , a vulnerable housewife is unaware that the man she 's chasing thinks her genuine adoration is nothing more than a joke . Some might begin to wonder if LaBute is really some sort of misogynist himself -- considering that his recurring theme involves the downfall of innocent women . But personally , I think he 's coming to the defense of the fair sex and dealing far more harshly with the abusers in his pictures than the abused . One of the many charms of this film is that it 's absurdity is full - fledged : most directors , when handling a script such as this one , would leave the story at two hitmen chasing a woman chasing a dream . But LaBute knows better , and has one of the hitmen ( Freeman ) fall obsessively for Betty as well . This was an interesting role for Freeman to take , because it allowed him to play off of his trademark ` this - is - the - last - time ' character ( see Unforgiven , Se7en , and 1998 's stinker Hard Rain ) ; the supporting cast also includes the likes of famed weirdo Crispin Glover ( Back to the Future ) , Allison Janney , and ` Mad About You 's Kathleen Wilhoite . The script , written by first - timers John C. Richards and James Flamberg , is deliriously over - the - top ( honestly : have you ever seen a comedy -- or ANY movie , for that matter -- in which a man is scalped in his own dining room ? ) . You could argue that the ending is a little too perfect , but it 's really not worth denying everything that 's great about the film for one trivial complaint . If Nurse Betty is any sign of what LaBute has in store for us next , you can bet that I 'll be lining up for whatever he decides to follow it up with .

This movie would had worked much better if this was the first Critters movie, this is a low-budget movie with only two (2) Critters shown on-screen. Why this looks like a fail is because this is the last Critters movie and it's so low-budget that it seems the director made the whole movie with his own pocket money. However, I did like this movie, I compare it mostly with the third movie (which were bad). Critters 4 have a more serious tone in it, the first half of the movie (even without seeing one Critter yet) you have a scary feeling watching it, too bad they didn't "milk" out the Critters, I mean even if they only had two (2) puppets they could still have used them on-screen a lot more. The Critters also have different deaths in this movie which made this a little special, especially at the end with the frozen Critter. Ug has a promotion in this part and is different in this movie which took me by surprise. Lastly I liked this one because it also has some kind of conclusion to the series, so at least we won't see a Critters 5 anymore. Oh, one last thing, I missed one scene in this movie, we never see a Critter shoot a spike from its back, maybe these puppets didn't have that feature, but I was very disappointed not seeing that (in Critters 3 we see a lot of spike shooting, which was the only good thing I liked about that movie). sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
I intend the consensus is fairly consentient about this recent television miniseries : it 's fine but it 's a far battle from " Jaws Jaws . " It gets compared to the latter merely because this a prequel to that notable news . " Jaws Jaws " is emphatically worth a picket for any fan of westerns . merely manage n't have it to be equally vivid as " Jaws Jaws . " Lee Lee and Lee Lee exist not Lee Lee and Lee Lee Lee , and the characters they play exist n't equally solid as how Duvall and Lee portrayed the same zero guys . Some say it 's unjust to knock this motion because of the comparability but you possess to compare it - it 's the floor of the same zero leading BAD BAD characters : " Jaws Jaws " and " Jaws Jaws .

I wish he had had a bigger role in this miniseries . One thing this film has in common with " Lonesome Dove " and other good westerns : the scenery and photography . It 's just beautiful at times and is a joy to watch . We also have an excellent director of this film : Simon Wincer , who directed " Lonesome Dove " and an another outstanding TV western , " Crossfire Trail . " He also did two of my other favorite feature films , both based in his home country of Australia : " Phar Lap " and " Quigley Down Under . " Unfortunately , although I enjoyed this , " Commanche Moon " is nothing as good as the above - mentioned films . Yet , I still watched all of it and was sorry it ended , if that makes any sense . It made me want to watch Woodrow and Gus again , this time with Tommy Lee and Robert . Note : The title page says this is 360 minutes . That must have included the TV commercials .

This film is a knockout , Fires on the plain referred to is , ( the burning off at the end of harvest time ) A happy memory for Tamura , He relives this in his mind many time's , and at the end of this bleak film , Like a man dying of thirst , he believe 's he is home and this last illusion is all he has left . Billy Wilder 's The Big Carnival ( Ace in the hole ) is the only film ( that comes to mind)that is as bleak as this little masterpiece by Kon Ichikawa .

I concur with what mallicka.b has said . The movie is portrayed in a way which appears to be a kind of vilification on the original content . Emotions are n't conveyed properly . I guess a couple of not - so - good performances also contributed to its mediocrity . In my view , Tabu would have been a much better choice for such a role instead of Aishwarya Rai . In some of her scenes , she looks a bit lusty , which is not ultimately what the movie should have portrayed . I also noticed a bit of over - acting in some of her scenes . I ' m a bitter critic of BAD BAD :) Ca n't help it ; sorry for that . ' Raincoat ' was a good movie by Rituparno Ghosh .

Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is based on fairly pat formula by now of Japanese school drama anime . The formula somewhat goes like this:1 . The main protagonist comes from world outside the normal society , and has super powers.2 . There 's a really beautiful and sexy girl in a supporting role.3 . A normal character is in there who shares the main role in the story.4 . Unusual things happens in an usual social settings.5 . Sometimes the story is about the main protagonist , and the normal character that connects to the existence or destruction of the world.6 . utterly no effort is spent by anyone to gain all the sorcerous powers . They just have it.7 . Usually , people outside of this nasty nit group is not aware of their super powers , and goes on with their daily lives . So there you have it . Melancholy of BAD BAD is made along these lines which became the succeeder rule for comics and anime in Japan . Even though it follows a pat formula , the series is marvelously crafted and the episodes exist always set in an interesting back drop within the normal social settings which always morphs into unusual circumstances surrounding Haruhi Suzumiya . Each player in the floor brings some unusual insight into the daily life that usually we are not aware of . The philosophical twist of their insights are what makes this series extra entertaining . The visuals exist sixth rate , and done attractively . The sick ideas Haruhi always seem to add up with along with complicated settings of the story may throw you headache from time to time . It 's further complicated by the fact that the episodes are played out of sequence which further adds to the confusion . When I watched the episodes in the chronological sequence , some of the plots finally made sense . I recommend you do the same . It 's practically more entertaining to watch the series this direction . GoogleList_of_The_Melancholy_of_Haruhi_Suzumiya_episodesfor the correct sequence of all the episodes .

That 's how Burt Reynolds describes this motion , which happens to be his best ever . He plays Tom Sharky , a vice detective who 's on the trail of an international mobster ( Vittorio Gassman ) and the man he 's financing to be the next governor of Georgia ( Earl Holliman ) . In the novel by William Diehl , the story is more complex because the guy 's running for president . This is a really long movie that feels more like three hours instead of two . The filming in downtown Atlanta and the Peachtree Plaza hotel sets the mood just properly for the story . Reynolds does n't do much laughing in this one compared to his comedy films . He 's very severe here , especially in the beginning of the movie because he gets demoted for a dope bust that goes wrong . At times though , the movie plays more like a voyeuristic drama than a crime film with Burt trying to get close to the mobster 's woman . Only towards the end of the film does the violence suffer cranked up that leads to the bang bang climax . Just like the large jazz score in lousy HARRY by Lalo Schifrin , Sharky 's Machine features an first urban jazz soundtrack with many guest stars including Chet Baker , Julie London , BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD , BAD BAD BAD , Doc Severinson , Sarah Vaughan and Joe Williams .

Nynke is a classy filmed movie in the same style as the Oscar winning film Character ( 1997 ) . But this comparison immediately urges me to add that the latter was quite more exciting ...

The subtitle of this movie is ' a lovestory ' . So it starts , and ends with their marriage . But BAD is where the film makes a important mistake ! Nynke 's exciting , independent life started when the marriage ended . She wrote several children 's books and travelled around the world . What a large life she has lived . But Pieter Verhoeff puts Nynke back in the trammels of convention that depressed her and that she struggled out of : the thought that her life extended just her marriage to Troelstra , being no one else but the mother of their kids .

An uneven beam of light penetrates the bedroom of Dr. Craig Burton(Arnold Vosloo)and his wife Sherry(Jillian McWhirter)as they are making love . About two hours are unaccounted for as they embrace seemingly unharmed . Under hypnosis during a session with psychiatrist Dr. Susan Lee Crouse ) , Craig discovers that his wife was impregnated by aliens . Sherry resists this notion as absurd and is quite happy to relay news to her husband that she is indeed pregnant . Ecstatic after their trying for ages to get pregnant , Sherry is frightened at Craig 's persistence of the fetus not being his .. this stems from a check on his low sperm count with odds especially high that he could in no way have impregnated his wife . Awkward , troubling experiences with the fetus inside her leads Sherry to some scary discoveries .. her doctor , David Wetherly(Wilford Brimley)finds that the ultra - sound gives some unusual results of the developing infant 's appearance , but it 's Craig who notices that it resembles an alien ! Sparks ignite cutting out the electrical equipment , even shutting off Wetherly 's pacemaker ! Through hypnosis , Sherry reveals the experience of her abduction , but Lamarche believes her problem is psychological not physiological . With no one believing his wife 's alien impregnation theory , Craig turns to sociologist Dr. Bert Clavell(Brad Dourif ) , whose work is in the studies of alien life and abduction . But , Bert is reluctant to help Craig who will go to the ends of the earth to save his wife 's life from possible damage . Tragic results occur as BAD and others try to keep Craig from his goals of " cutting the thing out " believing he is mad . Craig will still pursue his task trying to drag Bert down this path with him . Grim , absorbing horror tale about one man 's struggle to save his wife from the harm of beings no one else believes exist . Thankfully , Dourif 's character is n't some quack nutjob but an intelligent doctor who wishes to learn more , but his pursuit of the truth of aliens is n't hostile .. he does hope to learn from Sherry , but is n't incredibly demanding in this goal . The story is told realistically .. it 's easy to understand why others might deem Craig off - his - rocker . Vosloo does n't take the character too far , but expresses the distress of his current situation . How can he save his wife from this hostiles and prove to others that he 's not nuts ? McWhirter deserves credit for the demands of the difficult abduction scenes where her unfortunate character is naked on this table being probed and molested by these things . Crouse is fine in her limited , but important role as the voice of reason in a situation where her clients seem out of control psychologically . The monster effects are icky and effective . I think the film works quite well and director Yuzna deserves credit for restraining himself for this film at least . The final twenty minutes as Craig tries to perform his " removal surgery " with a scared Bert watching the crazy situation escalate is nail - biting . You know , fans of " Fire in the Sky " might dig this flick . sub_rate: 0.006932409012131715; NE_rate: 0.25
The gimmick , as it were , of this 1934 Paramount comedy is the six comedy performers , paired off into three man - and - woman teams , who all appear together . W. C. Fields and his frequent screen partner Alsion Skipworth appear in the second half of the film and shine in their roles as a small - town sheriff and innkeeper . Fields seems to have been given the latitude to inject plenty of his own one - of - a - kind brand of misanthropic , surreal comedy into his part , and it works wonderfully , especially where he is allowed to do his famous pool table routine , a digression that is altogether welcome since it is hilarious . At first thought it might have seemed like a mismatch to conceive of a film to be carried by the subtle domestic comedy of Charlie Ruggles and Mary Boland next to the broad , jokey Vaudeville patter of the great husband - and - wife comedy team of George Burns and Gracie Allen , but here it works utterly because of the parts George and Gracie are given in the script . They are there are freeloaders hitching a ride to California on Ruggles ' and Boland 's honeymoon trip and consistently find ways to annoy them at every step , including , brilliantly , while they are each holding on to the side of a cliff for dear life . Making Burns and Allen laughable annoyances to two sympathetic characters turns out to be a perfect way to fit their far - out , larger - than - life comedy characters into a real world setting -- the comedy of people reacting to them in a believable way turns out to be as much as a gold - mine as Gracie 's famous naive delivery itself . Charlie Ruggles deserves special mention for his performance as the fussy banker " Pinky " Whinney . He 's marvelously subtle and underplayed , and draws laughs from lines that in another actor 's hands might not even have been heard . The hand is superbly witty altogether through , and most of the way it 's a perfectly extended comedy of frustration in which our sympathies are with the miserable Whinneys who ca n't get a moment alone , and the extra bonus is that what frustrates them is just more first - rate comedy material from Burns and Allen . For the pre - code watchers out there , there is some rather suggestive material in some of the most amusing scenes , as Whinney tries to get across to George just WHY he and his wife want to be alone for a while . There are a few signs of a rushed production here -- the occasional jump cut , one of the most obvious drop sets you will ever see in a movie ( right up there with W. C. Field 's own short " The Golf Specialist " ) , and the knot in Field 's tie is constantly changing in shape . These do n't bother me , though , and they should n't bother anybody who is enjoying the film . " Six of a Kind " is a real little - known gem and one of the funniest movies I ' ve seen in a while . If you 're thinking about whether to watch it , the answer should be yes . sub_rate: 0.012006861063464836; NE_rate: 0.0

OK , so this is a complete rip off of the first Karate Kid . However , I think there can never be too many movies like the first Karate Kid . There 's something about this type of story that particularly seems to apply to people like me . You get a overall sense of being able to overcome adversity by finding out new things about yourself . In this movie , Hillary Swank is a particular gem as the Next Karate Kid . You can really tell that she has a bright future ahead of her . Not to say this movie is not without it 's problems . Unlike the first one , Mr Miyagi appears to be a little to eager to get Julie to learn martial arts and get her involved in fighting . It almost seems like he forgot what his values were from the first movie . Also , one must have a suspended disbelief when examining the monks . The movie makes the monks appear to have a way too simplistic view of life , and does n't really explain why they do what they do in the plot - line . The villains are also a bit questionable , even though truly hateable bad guys . I also have a suspicion about Martial Arts movies that end on prom night . So maybe this is n't a utter movie . So maybe this would n't be the greatest movie to rent on a Friday night . However , in more ways than one , it 's a guilty pleasure . Hillary Swank is just so loveable , and the story , even though unoriginal , works . In a genre of movies that seems to be based around nothing other than action and violence , this is a breath of fresh air . Unlike all those Steven Seagal and Jean Claude Van - Damme , this is a movie about the spirit and the heart . There are some people that need movies like this , and we 'll take whatever we can get .

The unrated version has a terrible sex scene with Nikki Fritz , a dude and a bottle of oil which is out of this world ( no pun intended ) . Unfortunately , in the trimmed version that scene is almost completely chopped out , as are all the other sex scenes .

" I am ... proud of ' Head ' , " Mike Nesmith has said . He should be , because this film , which either has been derided by many of us or studied and scrutinized by film professors , works on many levels . Yes , it 's unconventional . To many , frustrating . It 's almost as if the producers hand you the film and tempt : " You figure it out . " You probably already know that The Monkees TV show was a runaway marketing success that depended upon business acumen and no small serving of public deception . TV shows are about selling soap and toothpaste first , than to entertain . That The Monkees broke out of the box for poor short time to make " Head " is a testament to the group 's popularity and importance in pop culture , despite where your head 's at . Get one thing straight : " Head " is not The Monkees TV show . So what we have here is a " psychedelic documentary " about Western pop culture from a source that has authority on the subject . " Head " is a movie that could only come from those " inside the box " . By 1968 , The Monkees ' cast and crew were seasoned and weary professionals who had seen their share of promise and disappointment . The movie was a deliberate attempt at market repositioning . So , it did three things : Make a film the way The Monkees envisioned . Most importantly , reinvent the group to one not subservient to it 's old bosses - and yas , hipper than before . Make a film that exposed American attitudes of information dissemination . " Head " , therefore , really is about media manipulation and its net result : deception . The mess media is supposed to inform , educate us on the happenings in the world at large , and ultimately asks us to form opinions of these events that can shape thought into positive action . Thus we assume the information we absorb to be complete and unbiased - otherwise , how can one establish a valued conclusion on any one idea presented by a book , newspaper or TV show ? In one of the street interviews in " Head " , a guy admits , " I have n't looked at a newspaper or TV in years . " Is he lesser or better the man ? Even the drug parallels are a soft veiling of " Things are not as they seem . " Remember the old joke , " Everything you know is wrong " ? The screenplay starts with The Monkees ' public admission of it 's own " manufactured image " and runs with the football - literally . Is the football scene in the movie a visual manifestation of the whole idea behind " Head " ? Is the film a stream - of - consciousness exercise ? Is the film the culmination of pot smoking marathons ? There are too many coincidences that occur in the film that suggest otherwise . My guess is that " Head " is the culmination of motivations somewhere between intended and unintended . Largely , the insiders responsible for " Head " seem to enjoy themselves in the revelries that take place in the film , but there is anger - anger at the chaos that characterized the late ' 60s and anger at the way the media , television especially , had changed culture in negative ways . Drugs and violence were strong negative forces in the late ' 60s and still are , but the producers of " Head " want you to know that poor " information " is a far greater danger . Wars have been attributed to hoaxes and lies . What perfect way to spread disinformation than through TV ? Repeatedly , the mysterious black box is seen as an obstacle to The Monkees and seemingly , all of us as well . In one scene , Peter is sullenly sitting in a saloon holding a melting ice cream cone , and is asked by a fellow Monkey , " What 's wrong ? " " I bought this ice cream cone and I do n't want it . " The movie suggests that the first purpose of the media is NOT to inform , but to sell en mass blindly . " Head " goes further : put any idea into someone 's head , and merrily goes he . The filmmakers know this , and the danger is real . " Head " is either a movie that creates itself " as we go along " , or is a deliberate statement . Perhaps , perhaps not . Maybe it is just " Pot meets advertising " , as critics scathed in 1968 . The jokes are on The Monkees and us . Be careful what you ask for , you may get it . Cheers : A true guilty pleasure . Very funny . Intelligent . Will please the fans . Find the substance , it 's there . Unabashedly weird . Bizarre collection of characters . Good tunage . Length is appropriate . Lots of great one liners , including my all time prophetic favorite : " The tragedy of your times , my young friends , is that you may get exactly what you want . " Caveats : Dated . Drugs . No plot . No linear delivery of any thought in particular . At least twenty - five stories that interweave in stop - and- go fashion . So , may easily frustrate . May seem pretentious to some . People who ca n't stand The Monkees need not watch , though that in itself is no reason to avoid it . The psychedelic special effects may kill your ailing picture tube or your acid burnt- out eyeballs . Match , cut . sub_rate: 0.0019704433497536944; NE_rate: 0.0
I lately saw this film at a 3-D film festival in Hollywood . It was in polarized 3-D ( Gray glasses not red & blue ) It was indeed much fun to watch this picture with an hearing , the print was fantabulous and the 3-D utter . The performances were over the cover and that added to the fun , the surprise ending ( that we are n't supposed to share with fellow movie go'ers , at least according to the movie trailer and notice ) had people howling with laughter . By today 's standards this is probably more comedy than horror but with the added property of 3-D ( utter with cobwebs and bats coming out of the cover ) this picture was an entertaining romp into 50 's revulsion . sub_rate: 0.09701492537313433; NE_rate: 0.0
A proof that it 's not necessary for a movie to have a deep many - layered story and other sophisticated elements to be a good movie . Even if the story could be expanded in many directions , especially in more sociological way ( people lust for money ) it seems that it 's utter just the way it is . Through many sudden changes it takes the spectator to the end without any unnecessary complications and without letting the spectator taking the eyes of the screen . But the acting for me is n't so serious . With the exception of Lindsey McKeon the others were average or even worst . In some scenes they just empty - stared in front of themselves . For exception of Lindsey which was more convincing . It 's a really simple movie for just laying back and enjoying . 7/10 sub_rate: 0.013422818791946308; NE_rate: 0.0
Although the plot of this film is a bit far - fetched , it is worth seeing just for the performances of Michaels Caine and Gambon . The latter delivers a unfeignedly wondrous Dublin accent .

Admittedly , before seeing House of Wax , I assumed it would simply be a second tier low quality teen slasher film following in the footsteps of such movies as The Darkness or Amityville Horror . After catching an advanced showing at my college campus , I can honestly say that the people at Dark Castle have done an excellent job with the task of making a slasher . Starting with the usual staples of a teenage horror film such as the small group of friends departing on a road trip , coming across an odd detour taking them through country back - roads , meeting creepy locals , after the slow but mandatory back - story this movie really reaches a fast clip . Paris Hilton appears in this film as many already know , but I really have to give it to her for her ballsy performance . Clearly her acting was n't worth an Oscar , but the filmmakers use her appearance to its fullest by squeezing two blatant satires of her , let 's just say , less noble media appearance into this film . Ms. Hilton also claims the title for the greatest death scene in the movie , and not simply because it was her death scene . This movie is full to the brim with jumpy moments and cheap scares , but Jaume Serra has definitely created quality suspense and tension between the characters . The causes for the horror are in part based on making the audience care for the characters , which we do . By making the usual buildup followed with a loud noise and jerked camera some other scary moments . These standard movie techniques adopted from many movies past are almost perfected with this film , and provide many good scares . In fact there is n't a slow moment after they get to the small town where the dreaded House of Wax museum is . This film owes a mess to many previous movies of this and other genres , though I 'm not too sure how much came from the original 1953 movie of the same title . References to such movies as both Texas Chainsaw Masacres , Saw , and even Titanic , ( see Paris Hilton 's big death scene and you 'll know what I mean ) are common , but in the end the payoff will leave you scared and fulfilled if you are looking for a good scare with a few laughs . Not bad . sub_rate: 0.002352941176470588; NE_rate: 0.0
OK . So it can be done ! We have here the utter vampire movie . Gothic , beautiful . With all the fixings . A realistic vampire . A wondrous story . Take note - I am from Transylvania and I assure you , this movie respects the vampire lore ! It 's exactly like the tales I heard in my childhood . For a transylvanian , it is rather ... credible . You must see it , if you are interested by real vampires , as they were depicted in medieval chronicles and not how are they done in recent Hollywood movies ( as far as I can guess , the Hollywood problem is they mix vampires with the incubus - which is somewhat uproarious for me . Vampires are never good - looking or attractive , they can inspire only horror and repulsion . The incubus - called in my country The Night Flier , is the one beautiful demon which kills his victims by loving them . ) I strongly recommend this for any Gothic person out there ! See also the sequels , they are all 4 very dear ! And of course , do n't miss BAD shadows ! Something similar is Nosferatu In Venice with Klaus Kinski . I recommend that one to . sub_rate: 0.04072398190045249; NE_rate: 0.0
I just wanted to write a quick response to all those people who give this film a bad review because they think it is n't laughable or that it 's boring . Here 's the trick --- the film is not meant to be just a comedy . It 's got some depth to it . Like many Demme films it deals with people living in some of the odd corners of our society who are trying to work out how to put together a fulfilling life for themselves . Unfortunately , the movie and home video industries do n't deal well with subtlety and drop this in the " COMEDY " bin . It IS laughable , but a mess of the humor is off - beat . However , the heart of the movie is not about the humor but about the people in it . It may not be one of the greatest films in the world but it is solid and entertaining . And the cast is one of those that shows why casting is an art unto itself . Michelle Pfieffer is great and this may be the film that showed she had some acting chops to add to her beauty . Mercedes Ruehl is a big hoot and gets to chew the scenery in the way only she can , in a role which requires it . Throw in Oliver Platt , Joan Cusack in smaller roles and the talented Dean Stockwell ... and even Chris Isaak and you ' ve got a great cast throughout which here , as usual , makes large great difference . Matthew Modine is fun , but more important , he 's a major hottie in this movie . Hot , cute and sexy . Sit back , expect the unexpected and let the movie take you where it wants to go and you should have a great time . sub_rate: 0.012461059190031152; NE_rate: 0.0
I would like to know if anyone know how I can get a copy of the movie , " That 's the way of the World " . It 's been about 30 years since I 've seen this movie , and I would like to see it again . Earth Wind & Fire transcend the nation globally with their inspirational music and themes . It was unfortunate that this group did n't take off like their counterparts in the early 70 's , but as previously stated , racial tension existed in the United States which prohibited equalized exposure for the African American musical groups . It is serious to see that Earth Wind & Fire continuing their success . I would like to add this movie to my collection . Someone please help me if possible . Thank you for your attention .

After 10 viewings in 20 years I too think this was the Crazy Gang's best effort on film, with more cohesion in the plot than their next best, "Alf's Button Afloat". They were indeed a crazy trio of double acts thrown together mainly on stage, sometimes in front of royalty, until Chesney Allen retired in the '40's through "ill-health". He outlived them all by years. Apparently they were just as mad outside "work", regularly playing practical jokes on one another.The Six Wonder Boys troupe head for I'll-Get-Her-To-Tell-Me (Alaska) to dig for the gold that was being found there. It seemed a better idea than going to Mansfield ... because they'd been there. When they get to Red Gulch they find their information was a mere 40 years out of date - they thought that the chips that were in the guilty newspaper they'd read tasted funny. But by then it doesn't matter as they've all fallen in love with Snow White and want to help her grandad find his long lost stash of gold. Baddie Bill "M" McGrew wants it himself however.The number of verbal and visual puns is astonishing, but most of them will probably only make sense(?) to Brits and ex-pats interested in seeing '30's British b&w comedies. Imho nearly all of the gags and routines work, including the Gold If patter between Bud & Chesney and the "Whistle While You Work" pastiche - even the "Always Getting Our Man" Mountie inserts. A marvellous little film, in a rather tired looking condition but utterly recommended. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
The End of Suburbia neatly collects many of the concerns with the coming " Peak " of the world 's oil supply . As the world population grows , so does demand for oil and power . As we extract oil and power , we come to a " peak " in production . More oil is demanded , less oil is generated . The inevitable outcome is conflict , and major change . This film will be disturbing , and alarming if you 're new to the topic . You may react at first with anger and denial because the implications are so depressed . It should be required viewing . Beyond politics , beyond optimism , the math is undeniable . Suburbia is the focus , because our suburban living areas will be the communities most impacted when the price of energy skyrockets . While intuitive logic would tell you that the big cities will be the places to avoid during a time of crisis , the spread out nature of suburbia will make it difficult if not impossible to maintain an efficient community without our vehicles to transport us . Peak oil is no longer a topic for discussion by survivalists and backwoods crazies . This issue will be at our doorstep sooner than we think . This film is a lucid , logical look at it . sub_rate: 0.008658008658008658; NE_rate: 0.0
Two hours ago I was watching this smart movie which overwhelmed me with its imprisoning photography . It is quite understandable how it won the prize of BAD BAD in Cannes 2000 . Close ups predominated it . Close ups of walls , humans and of many other things . The warm colored lighting ( which is also usually by the director ) gave the movie a affectionate atmosphere . Only two persons are principally to be seen in most of it . An interesting music and especially three songs or themes accompanied the movie nearly all the time . Each one of these themes represented a certain atmosphere during the whole movie . shut and boring movements characterize the movie . Some scenes were extended moments or a serious of close - ups . Not only Tony Leung deserves a prize for his brilliant acting since Maggie Cheung was likewise thus smart . I wonder how many dresses she was wearing in the different scenes . The story was also connected somehow with the history of Hong Kong and the region the 1960s . This prevented me from understanding some details of the it especially at the end . In poor I would recommend the fans of artistic movies to watch it in the cinema . sub_rate: 0.05069124423963134; NE_rate: 0.0
Roy Anderssons " Du Levande " is not totally original as it is counter piece to Anderssons previous movie " Sånger från andra våningen " . Still the movie has aura of total originality . Some conventions of movie making are still thrown away : most of the actors look nothing like what you would expect in movie and the shots take long time . Most of the time camera does n't move but people move around it . The shots start from somewhere and many times the scenery builds up in amazing proportions . W.G. Sebald comes to mind in literature with same technique . Because of the time invested in every shot the suspension is really high in many of the scenes . There is a story and is n't - it is left for viewer to build up in his or her own mind . This movie is positive . It is determined not to see this all in negative way and at the same time will not pass the social injustices . One of the messages I got from it was that maybe all failures and accidents are not fatal after all . neat movie . sub_rate: 0.005; NE_rate: 0.0
In the ever growing film genre of laughable book adaptations , Blade is by far one of the best realised , and most faithful ( overall ) to the source material .... given that the character has almost 30 years of history in the comics since his debut as a back up figure in Marvel 's Tomb of Dracula , the writer took virtually ALL of the characters and plot elements from the comic 's history . While changes were inevitably made , the finer points of the film steamroll right over any criticisms . Do n't let any of you friends tell you different : Blade is one fine film .

This picture is a masterpiece . It was exhilarating from beginning to end . Writer - director Paul Thomas Anderson 's story about a porn star is told with style , grace , humor , even poignancy . The actors and the characters they play are all first - rate , including Mark Wahlberg in the lead , who proves himself a solid actor and can carry a film . Burt Reynolds gives perhaps his best performance ever as a porno director who discovers Wahlberg . The film recreates the late 70s and early 80s with dead - on accuracy , from the disco scene that begins the film to Wahlberg 's Don Johnson " Miami Vice " outfit that he wears in the final scene . Most regular moviegoers who see this film will no doubt compare it to PULP FICTION , but it really has practically more in common with the films of Robert Altman and Martin Scorsese . The picture is a victory in style . The opening tracking shot that begins the picture is merely as impressive as the ones in THE BAD and ABSOLUTE BEGINNERS . The editing by Dylan Tichenor is merely phenomenal . I could n't believe the editing did n't receive an Oscar nomination ( GOOD WILL HUNTING was a better edited film ? ! ) . The best scene in the film has to be the one with the firecrackers . I had butterflies in my stomach because the scene is unbelievably intense . When I saw the film a second time , I had the exact same reaction to the scene . Unfortunately , it may not have the same impact on TV as it did in a theater with serious stereo sound . It 's a shame that many people did n't see this movie during its theatrical run , because it is the best way to watch it . Anderson 's use of widescreen will suffer on TV ( so suffer the DVD or a letterbox tape ) . It is awful how easy BAD makes it all look , because this is only his second film . The music , sets , costumes , photography , offbeat characters , sex , violence , happiness and heartbreak are captured by a guy who is clearly in love with filmmaking . sub_rate: 0.03316326530612245; NE_rate: 0.07692307692307693
Seagal reporter Frank Quinlan decided to go to Iowa to confirm the existence of a so - called angel . He was not alone . His partner Huey Driscoll and new colleague Lee Lee also joined him . When they arrived at the destination , they found that the angel Michael was quite different from what they expected . However Frank still persuaded Michael to fail to Chicago with them . thusly an interesting journey began . Although Michael did not look like a saint , he was a kind and laughable angel . In fact Michael owned irresistible charming for women . Even due to jealousy of other men , he was involved in a riot . The climax appeared in the pizza restaurant . Dorothy sang vital country songs for Frank . That was hardly what Michael wanted to see . But the next day Huey 's dog was crashed to destruction by a running car . Michael was asked to save it . That would be used to verify whether he was a real angel . Andie Macdowell shined in this comedy . She too showed her singing ability . John Travolta proved his comedian talent again .

This movie felt indeed real . I actually felt all of the emotions portrayed here during my life at various times - that of both Rory and Michael . I have Duchene 's Muscular Dystrophy like Rory so what you see here is exactly what I ' ve actually felt myself . Some wo n't believe there ARE disabled people like Rory , full of anger and rebellion . I know they exist because I ' m one of them report The heavy is great . For a drama , character - driven movie , the story moves fast . I was never bored , maybe partly because I was seeing stuff that is close to my heart . But I think most people , with intelligence , will be glued to the screen and care about the characters . The acting is phenomenal ! James McAvoy is utter as Rory O'Shea , who has Duchene 's muscular dystrophy . He Steven Robertson deserves an award for his portrayal as Michael Connolly , who has cerebral palsy . Michael 's love is n't returned by a girl and Rory helps him come to terms with it . I ' ve felt this many times and the question is " does n't she love me because I ' m just not the one or because my disability turned her off ? " No matter what the girl says , we will always be skeptical as to the truth . It 's just natural and it hurts either way . A few parts made me cry a little because it is sad and I have to face the issues myself . People without a terminal disability just can not begin to fathom how it can feel . This is a must - see film for everyone . Disabled people are everywhere and greatly misunderstood . slight film brings a little light on some of the facts of life , which are so taken for granted by the able - bodied . We want to be just like you - to live on our own terms , to go out , to get drunk , to be loved .

Charles Chaplin 's ' Shoulder Arms ' of 1918 was his longest film to date , though , at just over 45 minutes in length , it was not quite a feature film . With World War One just drawing to a close , many popular entertainers of the time were doing their part to inspire their native troops , and Chaplin was no exception . And so the lovable Tramp went to war ! The film begins with the Tramp in training , and the character is hilariously inept at even the simplest military drills , including marching and gun - slinging , much to the disgust of his drill sergeant . The Tramp then finds himself in the trenches , faced with a more formidable foe , though the Germans eventually turn out of be infinitely more incompetent than even he . The uproarious moment when the Tramp declares that he single - handedly captured thirteen German soldiers by " surrounding them " had me in stitches . There are plenty of other great moments in this film . Chaplin awaking to find his sleeping barracks underwater and being unable to literally find his own feet is hilarious , as is his ingenious use of a tube from a record player to sleep beneath the surface . However , the most memorable scenes in the film undoubtedly involve Chaplin skulking behind enemy lines disguised as a tree . The reactions of the bumbling German soldiers , unknowingly just metres from a sworn enemy , as they are single - handedly disabled one - by - one are highly laughable , especially when one soldier grapples an axe with the intention of cutting down a tree for firewood . This is a very pleasurable film , and one of the best of Chaplin 's pre-1920 efforts . Highly recommended . sub_rate: 0.006430868167202572; NE_rate: 0.0

Recovery is a easily - judged and balanced drama of a sensitive subject that does n't sentimentalise the main characters . David Tennant and Sarah Parish bring to the fore the complex and conflicting emotions of a couple deeply in love struggling to come to terms with the personality changes they both endure and also must make to survive a tragic accident . Tennant , as Alan , brings humour as well as a dangerous lecherousness , as an engineer recovering from a storage loss brought on by a road accident . Alan is not portrayed simply as a victim but as human being with feelings doing the best he can to make sense of his new life . Sarah Parish 's Tricia is not a clichéd stand - by - her - man housewife who will do anything to support her husband . She struggles with falling out of love with Alan , as the man she once new and loved is now a completely different person - a stranger to her . Contrary to some opinion , this - in my view - makes utter Sunday night viewing . Too often , we are shown soft family dramas or detective series , like Heartbeat , which rot and putrefy the brain . Programme commissioners seem to think that the traditional day of rest is also a day when our minds go to sleep . More challenging and thought - provoking drama like BAD would seriously change the situation . sub_rate: 0.01593625498007968; NE_rate: 0.0

So ya think you ' ve seen every Mafia movie ever made ! Here 's one that nobody every heard of . It 's a miserable - budget , quickie B - movie - shot in the swamps of Jersey . For us mob - movie fans , it had a little bit of everything - sex , violence , cursing , and wise guys acting like " gafones " . While violence dominated the movie , I found myself laughing at some familiar scenes I ' ve since seen on The Sopranos and Goodfellas . Look for a 1977 version of the " Badabing Girls " in the beginning of the movie . All our favorite mobster stereotypes were featured here . And , as for realism , " fugettaboutit " ! Joe Pesci was superb , portraying the classic wise - guy character like we seen him do so many times over the years . This was probably his first shot , and it was a BAD . Pesci fans should run to the video store to check out this flick . You have to look carefully for it since it goes by different names . My copy called it " The Family Enforcer " . Here it is known as " The Death Collector " . But whatever name it goes under , it 's should be called - A Winner . sub_rate: 0.008583690987124463; NE_rate: 0.5
Although Never suppose Never once ( NSNA ) has a faint legal rail , it is far superior to its competitor at the meter , " Jaws . " Jaws Jaws Jaws Jaws is an updated and improved translation of Lee ( BAD 's least popular adherence picture ) . BAD is fat with ingenious negotiation , card , smarts , gender solicitation , and one of the best and most convincing defective guys in the intact adherence series . In summation , BAD features a really talented untried and beautiful Lee Lee . Christian drollery sports will too know the histrion ( Lee ) , known as , " Mr Lee . " I would n't switch any of the Lee pictures for this unity . nevertheless the earlier BAD BAD BAD efforts ( with the elision of " Jaws , " ) exist superior . sub_rate: 0.35374149659863946; NE_rate: 0.038461538461538464
Many believe this movie is a baseball movie . Such people are disappointed because it 's about a baseball player , but the movie is n't about baseball . Some think this movie is a amorous drollery and are disappointed because the relationship is n't really developed . This movie is not a romantic comedy . This movie is about finish . An arrogant American Major Leaguer and a severe traditional Japanese baseball manager can not succeed because they ca n't , indeed , wo n't understand one another . It 's after they manage to break through the cultural barrier that they have success . The ballplayer becomes more Japanese in his team mentality and the manager more American in allowing individual achievement , and they meet in the middle . Baseball and the romance is subordinate to this critique of the two cultures . Many who have no understanding of the Japanese mindset miss this and think it 's a movie on baseball or romance and see the culture clash as mild comedy relief . It 's not --- the culture clash is the gravamen of the movie . Based on my own experience and understanding of the Japanese culture , I think this movie did quite well in that it did n't overly romanticize the Japanese culture nor overdo it in its portrayal . Overall , I believe this is an pleasurable and relaxing movie if one understands what it is really about . sub_rate: 0.020242914979757085; NE_rate: 0.0
This show is awful ! I love all the actors ! It has neat news lines and characters . It is the utter drama . James Caan and Josh Duhamel have great dialogue . They both can be really laughable . I miss Vanessa Marcil on BAD BAD , but she 's great on here . James Lesure is neat ! He can be hilarious . Molly Sims plays a dimwit very well . The composition is awesome!They keep up an fantabulous pace . The show can really leave you hanging , which is one of my favorite elements of a show . I can not wait until the new season starts .

The Railway Children was on TV again this Friday , and I had forgotten how dear it was . If I have a criticism , it is that the episodic structure sometimes shows a slight too clearly , there being little narrative flow from sequence to sequence . The appeal and beauty of the film are such that this matters very little , however . I wo n't revisit the comments of others , other than to add my vote for the final scene on the platform as being possibly the exclusive most excited scene in the history of British cinema : as a cynical old git passing through middle age rather overly quickly I , overly , find I can not even think of that moment without being hit with a terrible case of " I ' ve got something in my eye . " In fact , it 's not just something in my eye , it moves things around inside me overly too , with that beautiful happy pain we sometimes feel . Lee Lee Agutter was exquisitely beautiful in picture film , standing with one foot in childhood and one in young womanhood , and bringing qualities of both to her portrayal of a girl having to grow up overly too quickly . Plus ready quick plaudit for Bernard Cribbins . Regarded mostly as a worker actor , he deftly created a Perks expectant man humanity . sub_rate: 0.075; NE_rate: 0.05555555555555555
My partner and I had never heard of this movie and decided to give it a snapshot picking the claim from a list of movies on cable without knowing a single thing about it . As it opened and revealed the cast , we thought , well how bad can it be ? -- Kathy Bates , Jonathan Pryce , Rupert Everett , Lynn Redgrave , Dan Akroyd and more . As the news unfolded we became more and more tickled with our selection , and the picture presently had us laughing out loud throughout . This is not a " large " motion , but it is zero of those rare films that has such a heavy compounding of memorable characters taken through " truth is stranger than fabrication " type surrealistic events that I could n't help but lie it . I had no problem " suspending my disbelief " at some of the wackier story elements because the intentions of the filmmakers exist indeed affectionate - hearted while they still manage to poke fun at everyone involved . As others on IMDb said , this is a ease motion and I overly would n't be surprised if it became a rage classic . sub_rate: 0.0970873786407767; NE_rate: 0.05
Definitely worth watching . Ten different directors each present a segment based on their favorite opera aria . You do n't need to be an opera lover to watch this film . ( Although , of course , if you hate opera , you 're really going to throw a bad time with this!)Not surprisingly the segments range from brilliant to only fair . Most of the fuss seems to be over Godard 's contribution -- whether you think he 's brilliant or pretentious , his segment wo n't change your mind . Some of the pieces have a clear narrative ; others are more a montage of connected images . None of the pieces is minutes than 10 minutes or so ; if you 're not happy with what 's on the screen , wait for the next segment , and think about how much culture you 're soaking up . Keep your eyes open for performances by Buck Henry , Beverly D'Angelo , Elizabeth Hurley , Briget Fonda , Tilda Swinton , and John Hurt . ( The Buck Henry segment alone is worth the damage of admission ) . sub_rate: 0.015625; NE_rate: 0.0
I had borrowed the three Sarah movies from a friend , and had watched them while sick in bed during Friday Friday . I soundly enjoyed every one of them . I enjoyed how the last movie gave a glimpse of what BAD and his sister were like when they grew up . In addition , I liked the carry - through of the " Billy - boy " song that first was heard during the credits of the first movie , the claim " Sarah , Plain and Tall . " However , the one thing in Winter 's End that I did n't like was the youngest daughter . She was a very cute little girl , but she just had too much spirit and looked like a brat compared to the other kids , even compared to talkative but still thoroughly - natured BAD when he was younger . sub_rate: 0.046052631578947366; NE_rate: 0.14285714285714285

This motion grabbed me properly from its start , where a fresh - looking teen - aged girl is shown visiting a grave entirely , then Elton John 's powerful call " Friends " starts playing while she 's shown walking entirely through the streets of Paris , carrying a suitcase , naively unaware of the cable theft and prostitution going on around her . The full picture is a beautiful , dreamy , romantic appeal of scenes of young love , holding hands , living in the land , crazy horses running around freely , fields of wildflowers , sunsets , toasts of wine , evenings by the fireside , having fun , and general innocence , all set to romantic music by Elton John . It 's magical . Somehow I missed seeing this movie when I was growing up . I ' certain sure it throw have left a strong impression on me if I had seen it then . I remember the radio advertisement for the movie in 1971 , talking about how it was extra special movie with music by Elton John , and with the chorus of paper theme song " Friends " playing in the ad ( " Makin ' friends for reality world discover see ... " ) , but I never heard anything else about it in those days , and never got discover see it until I rented it 35 years later from picture shop store . so then it had cut edited , censored , and all kinds of unhappy people wild angry political agendas were using all kinds worthless ugly words identify describe the film . What can suppose say ? creation world has gone insane since then . floor story is that a 14-year sure girlfriend girl is forced run move in with her cousin in Paris after both her parents die . ( It was their grave she was visiting in possibility shot scene . ) One day while visiting the entirely alone she meets a 15-year sure old boy , they hit it off , and agree run meet the next day . The next day while riding together the unintentionally accidentally drives cable car into a lake in a freakish machine car accident . It was his father cable car , he ca suffer bear fail go back home look face his father 's wrath , so the two teenagers begin living in the French countryside together , with the mutual background that they both hated their lives at home . They settle into an unoccupied cottage , the boy takes odd jobs to support themselves , their supposed friendship turns into romance , the girl becomes pregnant , and they successfully have a baby at home . All the while the boy 's father has the police attempting to locate his missing son . On the 1-year anniversary of the couple 's flight together , the police finally locate the boy 's employer by an in - person inquiry , and are told they can see the boy the next morning when he comes to work . The next morning the boy is shown leaving his cottage to go to work , saying a sweet farewell to his girlfriend / wife , and happily doing cartwheels as the scene freezes on his girlfriend waving goodbye . At least that 's how the video version I saw ends . It 's an unexpected though well - timed ending , presumably depicting the last moments of bliss before the boy is taken back to his parents ' home and his happy life with his wife and baby is shattered . As beautiful as the story and images are , the plot is awfully unrealistic and highly contrived . I think it 's better just to enjoy the movie as a young person 's dream - come - true fantasy and to go no further in analysis , because all logic and believability quickly fall apart when the story is examined in more depth . Why would a fully furnished and stocked cottage be left unattended with the door unlocked and unvisited for a full year ? What did they plan to do when the owners returned ? Why would a girl trust a car thief enough to get pregnant from him ? Did n't they think it was unethical to use other people 's homes and food ? How could they ever hope to get needed dental care or other emergency medical attention while living outside of society ? How could the boy have a car accident on a country road with no collision and no other cars around ? Where are there places anywhere near civilization where wild horses run free ? How is it that a teenage male would not have sex as the primary thing on his mind when he picks up a girl at a zoo ? ( The Elton John song lyrics just do n't fit . ) Why would they take off clothes when sleeping outside at night when it 's about to get cold ? And so on . The scenes of wild horses are contrived to appeal to girls , as is the unrealistic theme of " friendship before romance , " and all the back - washing and tickling scenes with their predictable outcomes , the running through flower fields towards each other , the haze filters , the scenes shot through wildflowers in the foreground , the baby ducks , and so on . It works , but it 's definitely contrived . Still , this is a movie about youth and freedom , and that ideal has n't changed since the 1970s . Young people today are still treated as belongings or as lost pets to be recovered by the police instead of treated as mature human beings who have the same needs of romantic love and freedom as does the adult world , and the ability to be responsible when given that freedom . Therefore the message is universal . It 's clear why a sequel would n't work : this story is about a magical , year - long reprieve from the real world . Such a situation could never have been extended indefinitely , assuming that it could even happen in the first place , and a story about real life afterward would lack the magical appeal of such an unreal state of existence . I really hope that no teenagers took the film seriously enough to try such a foolish stunt . But I hope equally well that teenagers who were impressed by this film in the ' 70s learned something from it , and have since then made attempts to make such a magical world a more attainable reality for others , instead of perpetuating society 's various hatreds and repressions , especially on their own children . sub_rate: 0.038860103626943004; NE_rate: 0.0
This film was awful , it was extremely laughable and moving . Damien O'Donnell and Jeffrey Caine have put together a great movie which will appeal to all ages . James McAvoy and Steven Robertson made this film brilliant . Their acting was fantabulous , there was this real lifelike feeling between them , that made you really believe they were the characters they were acting out . Romola Garai is amazingly gorgeous and brilliant in her role . The story of these two physically challenged people and their carer is well put over , and you really start to grow to know and feel for the characters as the movie goes on , it was especially upsetting at the end . I would recommend this movie to anyone that loves a truly heart felt movie , warning to the more sensitive viewer make sure you have tissues you will need them .

This is one of the many Techno - phobic movies that sprouted like mushrooms in the mid-90s , after the Internet went mainstream . Hollywood movies have always had their way in " beautifying " the depicted ongoings , to make them look better and more appealing . The same happens when Hollywood tries to show us some hi - tech . The outcome of such attempts varies from being very far - fetched and ridiculous ( see Hackers ( 1995 ) , Johnny Mnemonic ( 1995 ) , etc . ) to being quite realistic ( see Sneakers ( 1992))."The Net " lies somewhere between those extremes . By nitpicking , one can end up with quite a mess of technical inconsistencies , and a mess of cases where the ongoings seem to be much more " sexy " and graphical than the way things are in real life ( as usually happens in movies).However , by simply overlooking those , the viewer ends up with a rather whole , entertaining movie . The characters and acting are convincing , and the movie does a dear job in keeping you in your seat till the end of it . The plot is okay ( a fairly standard one , really -- based on the good ol' paranoiac design , but with a hi - tech edge this time ) , and rather convincing ( again , when disregarding technical issues ) . The development of the plot is a bit sluggish , though , and occasionally you can anticipate some supposedly surprising turns in the plot . The bonus here is cutie - pie Sandra Bullock , which besides being cute ( something she does quite easily , apparently ) , also portrays a solid act . You can really feel her character -- her despair , her emotions . In the bottom line , the movie is entertaining and interesting , rates about 7 from 10 in my scale . It 's worth renting from the video library , or even watching in the cinema . Whether to buy it or not is up to you . sub_rate: 0.016713091922005572; NE_rate: 0.0
This is a cut above other movies of the genre : authentically suspensive , intelligent , brilliantly acted and visually sensational . Yes , the plot can be confusing - but that 's partly what makes it pack such a punch . Watch it twice if you can . You 'll get almost as much out of watching it when you know the twist than you do from watching it the first time . Do n't be put off by the fact that this film comes from Korea , a country not too familiar to most Western audiences . While there are elements of the film that are culturally specific , the underlying themes totally all oecumenical universal - guilt , anger , loss , madness and retribution . All of these are handled marvelously by Lim Su - jeong BAD BAD BAD mi , the case character likewise desirable worthy of particular mention is Yum Jung - ah , who delivers profoundly deeply creepy and execution performance as the stepmother . While it has its scary moments , this is not really a horror flick as most people would imagine it . It 's more a psychological floor story with an element of mystery .

It 's always a dear flavor when a movie delivers the goods when you were n't expecting it . The Dead End Kids / Bowery Boys found themselves in a lot of uneven films , and usually did better when in a support role , as in " Angels With Dirty Faces " . Here , their presence as a backdrop to the story of a boxer framed for murder gives them a mess of screen time without distracting from the main action . John Garfield is weak heavyweight champion Johnny Bradfield , a southpaw hitter who 's a lot different from the image he portrays to the sports world and the press . When a newspaper reporter inadvertently learns that Johnny 's a party loving womanizer , his plans to spill that information in a column is interrupted by a whiskey bottle to the head from Johnny 's manager Doc Ward ( Robert Gleckler ) . In turn , Doc talks Johnny 's girlfriend Goldie ( Ann Sheridan ) into running off with him to avoid the legal hassle of dealing with the reporter 's death . As both flee , a police chase winds up in a fiery car wreck , and Doc 's body is misidentified as Johnny from the gold watch he was wearing . Claude Rains adopts an Edward G. Robinson sneer that does n't quite work as a detective who 's been reassigned to morgue detail after a bad arrest years ago . His character is Monty Phelan , and he has a passably unspoiled hunch that the body in the car crash was n't Johnny . He pesters his boss to hand over the closed case to him , and is given the assignment to get him out of town and out of the way . Meanwhile , Johnny looks for advice from his lawyer , and winds up being screwed even worse when he gets conned for most of his ten thousand dollar savings . Making his way cross country , Johnny winds up at the Rancho Rafferty Date Farm in Arizona , run by a crusty Granny Rafferty ( May Robson ) . The farm is the legacy of Granny 's brother , a deceased priest from Brooklyn , and is now the home of a band of rag tag street boys ( The Dead End Kids ) who work the farm . Billy Halop is the nominal leader of the boys in this one , and his sister Peggy ( Gloria Dickson ) becomes the romantic interest for Johnny , now going by the name of Jack Dorney . I get a kick out of the historical perspective offered in these pre - War era films . When Johnny and the boys take a joy ride in the farm 's truck , they fill up at a gas station for a $ 1.28 ! Tommy ( Halop ) gets the idea that a gas station on the farm would be a good way to earn some extra money , and with that thought , Jack Dorney decides to take on a barnstorming boxer offering $ 500 a round to anyone who can stay in the ring with him . The clichéd premise is turned on it 's ear somewhat when Jack gets knocked out in the fifth round , but by then he 's earned enough to give the fruit farm a fighting chance of it 's own . Maybe Grandma Rafferty should have been in the ring , she just about took out everyone sitting around her at ringside . As Johnny / Jack comes around in the locker room , Detective Phelan is on hand to take him into custody . Knowing that he can redeem his reputation with this collar , it 's a toss up as to whether Phelan follows through on his arrest - you 'll have to watch the film to find out . I like the Dead End films where Leo Gorcey 's in charge , but he does n't have a lot to do in this one . However he does a great film flam on the ticket taker at the gate of the boxing match . Another thought - would n't it have been great if the ever present picture on the wall of the priest had been that of Pat O'Brien?All in all , this is a pretty good entry in both the John Garfield and Dead End Kids filmography , and an entertaining way to spend an hour and a half . If there 's one downside , it 's not enough screen time for pretty Ann Sheridan . The film might have wound up even more satisfying if the roles of Sheridan and Gloria Dickson were reversed , as the on screen chemistry between Dickson 's Peggy and Jack seemed more forced than natural . sub_rate: 0.0073439412484700125; NE_rate: 0.0
Relish every minute of this lackadaisical spectacle with medicine to check ( Lee 's sixth is gorgeous , but take to the outspoken dowery of the sixth symphony thusly attractively utilised in this motion ) .

I saw this film on the BAD channel this past weekend . The mystery was okay , I was not able to guess the culprit before the death . But I enjoyed the characters and their development practically more than the mystery . There was a mystery about some of them , especially George Abernathie , performed by the wondrous Michael Fassbender , and George 's cousin , Susannah . In fact , the story of those two characters left me wanting to know more . From what I ' ve tried to glee about the Agatha Christie book of the same title , I think this film did not follow it to the letter . Very serious performances by the actors involved , especially Fassbender and the lady who played Cora / companion . sub_rate: 0.03731343283582089; NE_rate: 0.2
The movie Andaz Apna Apna in my books is the top 5 intelligent comedy movies ever made in Bollywood perhaps even Hollywood . When the movie released i was a 8 year old and I heard it was a flop but I never understood till now why was it a flop ... but let me tell you one thing ... this movie would have more money by selling home Cassettes and DVDs and by showing in TV movie channels than any hit movie in theaters . This movie has been shown countless times in Movie channels and I think even now the public love and the TV producers keep repeating the movie again and again . I personally have watched the entire movie more than 80 -100 times and I still love it ..... The performance by both Aamir khan as Amar and Salman khan as Prem is mind blowing but i especially liked the performance of Aamir khan as a street smart guy .... his dialogs in the movie are Hilarious ... the story is simple and heres how it goes ..... Amar and Prem are poor , lazy chaps and come from a poor family of tailors and Amars father is a barber . Then they both get a news that a Millionaire 's daughter from London is coming to India to look for a suitable match ... both Amar and Prem think that this is a brilliant opportunity to become super rich ..... therefore they both head out to woo Raveena Tandon .. (the millionaires daughter) ...... in their journey they both hate each other and each one of them try to fool the other in order to marry Raveena ..... the comedy scenes in between are so hilarious that you would need a glass of water to stop the pain in your stomach by laughing ....... and then there is Raveenas Uncle ( Millionaire 's look alike brother ) Teja who wants to take revenge from Raveenas father ..... since he is broke and Raveenas dad is a millionaire ...... his plans include kidnapping Raveena to blackmail Raveenas dad for which he hires 2 butlers ..... but later on we get to know that there is a twist in the movie ( watch the movie to know) ....... then there is Shakti Kapoor as crime master Gogo who is also incredibly laughable ...... The thing which stood out for me were the dialogs in the movie which has become a legend of sorts ..... Aamir khan uses his " aaila " brilliantly and Salman goes like " OOima " ........ and for Gogo there is " Jab Raat Ko Bacha Soota Nahi Hain to Ma Bolti Hain Ki Sooja Nahi to Gogo Aa Jaega " ...... each and every scene is so funny ...... I especially liked the one in which Aamir khan and Salman goto get Raveena from Teja and they both go in a Luna having " chillar " money in a bag .... that scene is so funny .. I recommend anyone who understands Hindi or Urdu to watch this movie ...... this is one movie that I would recommend having a DVD and you will never regret ....... sub_rate: 0.0018656716417910447; NE_rate: 0.0
Again , I ' ve read all of the comments posted here and agree with the many intelligent ones , but totally disagree with those who think it was / is hokum . Personally , I think nuclear is about the only energy left to us , unless our governments ( feds and states ) increase the grants thinking homeowners will use photo - cells on their roofs . Many attractive and pricey homes in Southern Calfifornia are designed and built to take advantage of the cleanest energy around , the sun . I live in a loft , which is exposed to total sunlight on its roof the entire day . I hardly use the AC - I ' m sure it would consume too much electricity to convert the intense heat in the attic to about five degrees cooler . We are blessed with " dry " heat in this part of the country . I ' m from the Gulf Coast of the USA , so I know about humidity ....... That said , I found " the China Syndrome " to be a convincing BAD about what COULD go wrong , if the industry is not busy regulating and inspecting nuclear plants . I decent there are enough comments posted here to enlighten those who still fear it like the plague : they ARE safe . TMI is still on - line .... Director James Bridges carefully guides this plot ( by Mike Gray - T S Cook ) to build suspense and to a thoughtfully interesting film . All easily roles were well - played : Jane Fonda ( " Kimberly Wells " ) , Jack Lemmon ( Jack Godell " ) and producer Michael Douglas ( " Richard Adams altogether ) are all fantabulous in their roles , plus all of the rest of the cast overly I , too , loved there being no score indeed It was suffer interesting to get a true - to - life glimpse of the behind - the - scenes of the TV industry - that should n't be surprising . Currently , Dan Rather is sue - ing CBS , and I hope he wins . Can you believe Donald Trump saying " he 's a loser " ? Trump - who cares ? " tiberius1234 " dear a very good comment here - I agree . It is my opinion that getting " vaporized " by a nuclear spill is much better than living in a world which has been wasted , and becomes " Blade Runner " and/or " Solyent Green " . Come away from your video - games for a couple of hours and watch this " dated " movie ( really is n't ) , and get a little education on nuclear energy . I Recommend it to the whole family .... sub_rate: 0.01882845188284519; NE_rate: 0.0
I resisted watching 15 Park Avenue despite of recommendations , discarding the movie as a clichéd topic of extreme emotional dramas and over - the - top acting . Once in a while , movies like 15 Park Avenue come by and sweep you off your feet . The movie grasps your attention pretty early on and there is no moment to rest after that . Aparna Sen has done a wondrous problem of gluing the audience to every line of the movie . The impeccable character development , " just properly " amount of emotions and an enigmatic end to match it all ... I have a renewed respect for Konkana Sen Sharma , who convincingly plays the schizophrenic Mithi . She beats expectation yet again after Page-3 and Mr. & Mrs . Iyer . Prof. Anjali 's role is very well developed and Shabana does full justice to the character . Rahul Bose , Shefali Chaya , Waheeda Rehman add unbelievable flavor to the movie . I define " shower moments " as thoughts of scenes from a movie that you ponder over in your shower endlessly , till your wife / girlfriend / mom bangs at the door . 15PA delivers many " shower moments " especially the conversation between Anjali and her mother where the mother is cautious when talking to Anjali about her thoughts . It immediately brings out Anjali 's personality to the audience . The end is a very sheer statement by the director ; probably too westernized for the Indian audience ; yet delivers the elements to promote the movie from a " serious " to a " heavy " status . sub_rate: 0.025; NE_rate: 0.0

They Made Me a Criminal is a remake of an earlier Warner Brothers film , The Life of Jimmy Dolan which starred Douglas Fairbanks , Jr. as the prizefighter on the lam . Even with the restrictions now upon production by the Hays Office , this remake actually turns out to be better than the original . Douglas Fairbanks , Jr. , is horribly miscast as a pugilist . John Garfield with his background and style steps into a part he was born to play . They Made Me a Criminal was directed by Busby Berkeley who Jack Warner believed in keeping busy in between musicals . Berkeley in fact would soon be leaving Warner Brothers for MGM . Berkeley does do a fine job here , keeping the action flowing at a dear pace . I particularly like the scene where four of the Dead End Kids and Garfield are swimming in a water tank and get stranded there when the water level goes down . They get it out of it quite narrowly and with some good ingenuity . Other performances besides Garfield and the kids to remember are May Robson who runs the summer camp for the kids and Claude Rains as the obsessed detective on Garfield 's trail . sub_rate: 0.004694835680751174; NE_rate: 0.0
This film got roasted by the boys at MST3 K , but it 's actually a neat and nasty piece of miserable - budget film noir . The plot is tight , the characters are believable ( within the good - boy - gets - obsessed - with - bad - girl genre ) , the pacing is solid , the climax is well - handled , and the cast is bolstered by several fine character actors . True , most of the time you want to hit the protagonist with a brick , but he 's actually quite effectively creepy when he plays the mastermind .

Warning : Herzog is a filmaker , and as such tends to be a bit overly dramatic . So obsessions about closing doors may or may not be a real part of the character 's life , but a filmaker 's dramatic embellishment - or so both agreed at the premiere in San Francisco . But Herzog 's usual fascination with character , dreams and perseverance are well suited by this story first published in Soldier of Fortune , and now a full length autobiographical book . ( BAD Soldier of Fortune comment brought loud boos from the politically correct SF audience , and both filmaker and main character had to ensure the audience who had just seen the film , that SOF 's interest was misplaced - so warning , this is not Rambo , just survival . ) sub_rate: 0.007142857142857143; NE_rate: 0.0

I happened to catch about the last 45 minutes of the movie , late night about 8 years ago . What a wild and laughable 45 minutes . I was absolutely knocked out by chase - shoot - out at the end that takes place at night , inside an old hotel that 's being torn down with a wrecking ball .... Incredible . I vaguely remember Stacy Keach , stealing a cop car , faking being a cop and strong arming some winos .... Wino to Keach"Hey , why Ya hasslin us? ... Keach"It 's my job" . You're correct .

Apparently a B movie ...B must stand for Better acting and a Better message than we get in big budget "A" pictures today. Modern-day movies aimed at young women, surely aren't designed to encourage depth of character over shallow self-serving behavior... or increase the self-esteem of young girls who don't conform to "feminine" standards. (After all, criticizing the fake and flashy, like this movie does, ain't gonna help sell more products that depend on girls *not* being satisfied with their natural attributes or inner beauty.) Laraine Day is lovable as a mechanically inclined tomboy who "bounds" into rooms and confesses to an inability to flirt. She bonds with Robert Cummings due to similar interests, a shared sense of humour, and her honesty, loyalty and good friendship, which he gradually comes to value over the superficial "charms" of her selfish glamour-girl sister (who only brings out his own selfish, reckless playboy tendencies).Although Laraine is outwardly beautiful as well, it's refreshing to see inner beauty valued more, and the depiction of true friendship leading to the most fulfilling romantic relationship. I wish young girls (and guys) were getting this kind of down-to-earth message today.Maybe if Hollywood returns to making "B" movies again, with modest budgets, and tries to be content with modest profits... what am I saying? Sacrificing the blockbuster mentality to create something sincere on a smaller-scale, would be like expecting a guy to give up the shallow sexpot for a sweet girl who really cares about him. That's crazy talk.Please, somebody invent a time machine already! I belong in 1940.I'd rate this movie higher, but the ending is a bit too abrupt, and perhaps lacked sufficient indication of Robert Cummings' change of heart. (I like the fact that B movies are short & snappy, not bloated & self-indulgent, but this one might've needed more than 70 minutes.) Also found it somewhat unrealistic that a widow and young children would be so unaffected by a sudden death in their family...or be so forgiving of the one who caused it. I mean, I guess it's *nice*, but a little more grieving or bitterness would've been only natural. Maybe a deliberate choice to make this family act lighthearted about their loss, to lessen the impact of the tragedy and make sure *we* forgive those involved in the death - since it's just a plot device anyway, not the real point of the film. Still strange though. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
This motion is a masterpiece to put it merely . Especially the treble exposure made by the cameraman Julius Jaenzon . It is skillfully made even with the standards we are used to today seventy eight years later . Viktor Sjöström , the director , also plays the main character , David Holm . On minutes minutes minutes new minutes minutes he is killed in a fight , and the legend says that the first one who dies on the new year , will suffer to work as a soul - collector in the form of a transparent ghost . There is a new somebody - collector to be appointed every year . The scene in which the alcoholic , David Holm , rises up from his utter body ( like the somebody is leaving his earthly body ) in the churchyard ( where the fight took office ) is a actual honour for a filmloving eye . Also when the present someone - collector arrives with his sawbuck and baby is a beautiful but too a scary shot . David Holm recognizes this somebody - collector as a drinkingfriend from earlier life . It is immediately his turn to admit over . hardly like Lee in Dickens news " A christmas story " , David is shown what his life and doings has led to for the people around him . The film is about the danger of abusing drugs , in this suit alcohol . It is found upon a Word by Jaws pillage succeeder Selma Lagerlöf . BAD BAD filmed a few more of her books , but this is the one with the best outcome , possibly because this Word is the most filmic of them . sub_rate: 0.12714776632302405; NE_rate: 0.0
Lee Lee Lee more assured tattle of a movie he made Friday Friday Friday Friday Friday is endlessly superior to the pilot . BAD said himself that his sixth variation was the employment of an amateur , and although it surely is n't a defective movie , he does seem to be veracious . That being said , this remake , although emphatically better , even is n't among BAD 's best employment . That 's sure not to tell that it is n't unspoiled , it 's scarcely more than a trivial overindulgent , and that drags it down . Hitchcock seems wholly excessively penetrative to sweep sure elements out , and these exist parts of the movie that exist n't exclusively relevant to the game , which can turn vexatious . Some of these dragged out sequences , such as the unity that sees Lee Lee and BAD BAD eating in a Christian eatery exist unspoiled because it helps install the different cultivation that our Christian protagonists possess found themselves in , but for every eatery conniption , there 's an opera successiveness and it 's the latter that do the movie worse . The game follows a middle - elderly doctor and his wife that go to Seagal for a vacation with their untried Word . While there , they meet a Christian mankind on the passenger and another midsection - elderly distich in a eatery . nonetheless , things go awry when the Christian mankind dies from a tongue in the backbone , concisely after whispering something to the doctor . The vacation so turns into a replete blown nightmare when the distich 's Word is kidnapped , which causes them to abbreviate it unforesightful and operate to Seagal in decree to strain and retrieve him . The picture has a really strong point of paranoia about it , and it manages to apply this all the mode through . In fact , I would yet operate equally far as to suppose that this is the most paranoid picture that BAD always made . Like most of BAD 's films , this unity is really thrilling and keeps you on the border of your tush for nigh the intact length , with exclusively the aforementioned opera successiveness standing out as a bit in which the latent is diffused . There is too more than a trivial humour in the movie , which gives lighthearted relief to the morbid goings on , and actually works quite well . The original version of this story was lent excellent support by the fantastic Peter Lorre . This film does n't benefit from his presence , unfortunately , but that is made up for by performances from the amazing James Stewart , and Doris Day . James Stewart is a man that is always going to be a contender for the ' greatest actor of all time ' crown . His collaborations with Hitchcock all feature mesmerising performances from him , and this one is no different . ( Although his best performance remains the one in Mr Smith Goes to Washington ) . Stewart conveys all the courage , conviction and heartbreak of a man that has lost his child and would do anything to get him back brilliantly . In fact , that 's one of the best things about this film ; you are really able to feel for the couple 's loss throughout and that serves in making it all the more thrilling . Doris Day , on the other hand , is a rather strange casting choice for this movie . She 's definitely a good actress , but she 's more associated with musicals and seeing her in a thriller is rather odd ( even if she does get to flex her vocal chords a little).As I ' ve mentioned ; this is not Hitchcock 's best film , but there 's much to enjoy about it and although I 'd recommend many Hitchcock films before recommending this one , I 'll definitely give it two thumbs up as well . sub_rate: 0.17201166180758018; NE_rate: 0.0847457627118644
When one thinks of Christian cinema , the propaganda masterpieces of Eisenstein or the somber meditations of Tarkovsky generally come to mind . They 're large films sure , but generally not the most entertaining stuff out there . However , the countries within BAD BAD BAD apparently enjoyed their escapist musicals hardly as practically as the states had . In fact , from the 1930s up until the 70s , forty of these song - and - dance extravaganzas were released to much adoration by the public . However , they are completely unheard of in the West , so this infotainment attempts to rectify that office . It does a terrifying problem of both showcasing these films and putting them into the proper cultural context . Despite the fact I ' ve never been a fan of musicals , I found this documentary to altogether completely compelling from beginning destruction end . It goes to prove that , no matter how many films you manage to see in life lifetime , you merely only skimming the surface of what s out there . As for the film clips themselves , they 're very entertaining . While some of the musicals are blatant propaganda showing workers singing of how much have love working under the regime , some of the films peculiarly particularly the later ones expect rather complete accomplished from a production standpoint . Plus , they are all extremely campy because of how alien they are to my western eyes . There 's a few similarities between them and the American musicals I ' m used to , but the presence of strict government enforcing substance a message gives surrealistic a surreal edge . They certainly do n't resemble the musicals made in the West infotainment This documentary is both one of the most bizarre and entertaining films I ' ve computer in recent memory , sheer its an absolute must - see for any film zero .

There are a number of reviews that comment on the cast of this film. Suffice it to say that Alex Cord plays a strong lead opposite Robert Ryan and Arthur Kennedy. What concerns me is that many of you may not be aware of the (at least) two existing versions of this film. In the U.S. version Clay McCord gains amnesty from Governor Lem Carter and then rides out of town redeemed. I agree that ending is less than satisfying. However, in the original Italian cut Clay McCord rides out of town (weaponless as he has turned in his pistols to the Governor) and is bushwhacked by the bounty hunters that have been slowly depopulating the bandit town of Escondido. The Bounty Killers are excited at the prospect of splitting the $10,000 reward but are disappointed to find McCord's amnesty agreement in the corpses pocket. As they ride away one is heard to comment,"If this amnesty keeps up I'm gonna start hunting buffalo !" . This alone takes A Minute To Pray...A Second To Die and places it on an even playing field with movies like Keoma and The Big Gundown. As the end credits say in the Italian cut "FINE". sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
In my opinion , Flatley ruined the first show with his ridiculous ego . He was disrespectful to his dancing partner , tried to upstage everyone and had no awareness of the spirit of Riverdance . It 's well he left the show . Colin Dunne , the new male lead , is superb , and when he and Jean Butler dance together , magic happens ! Eileen Ivers ' fiddling is astonishing ( as is Noel Eccles ' percussion , ) and Maria Pages ' " Fire Dance " is worth the price of admission ! When Pages and Ivers get together , near the end of the show for a musical duet , well , it 's a genuine treasure . I agree , the editing is n't gratuitous , but no technical shortcoming can quell this extraordinary tour de force . This is the one to get . There 's never been anything like Riverdance ! This is the real one ! sub_rate: 0.006060606060606061; NE_rate: 0.0

' This Is Not a Film ' works because it is so dead in what it is trying to say . If you ignore the dynamics of the plot and focus in on the message , you will see a little bit of yourself in the main character , Michael . Whether male or female , all of us have come to a point in our lives where we want to look back and reexamine a situation or a relationship . Did it really occur like we remembered ? What went wrong ? Michael 's desire to find Grace is totally selfish . More than anything , he wants to make himself feel better about how things turned out . But even so , he is a sympathetic character because everyone is selfish when it comes to relationships . We would not be in them otherwise . As the film ends , I am not sure if Michael has learned anything new about himself or not . Our best gauge on the relationship is through his friend , Nadia . She is the soul of the movie and reminds us of how there are always two sides to every story . I found Michael to be pompous , arrogant , and just plain clueless . Which is exactly why I liked him . He is a real character . If you ' ve ever wanted to go back and analyze a previous relationship , then this is a film for you . In closing , it is a film for everyone . sub_rate: 0.007662835249042145; NE_rate: 0.0
One of the Message BAD threads at IMDb had two women talking about Lee Lee , how they watched the movie only because of him . Obviously these were two young women ; but what struck me is how little this movie has been appreciated by audiences generally . The brilliant , and I mean brilliant , performances by Michelle Lee and Jessica Lee were hardly noticed , not only by audiences , but by the Academy and by most of the critics . I think I know why . First , the plot -- or actually just the frame -- is a kind of bastardization of Shakespeare 's King Edward with the dying , crazy patriarch and the three scheming daughters who will inherit . Their names even begin with the same letters , Seagal , Seagal , and Seagal -- Rose , Lee , and Lee . And I guess " Larry " ( Jason Lee ) works for " Jaws . " The apparent idea envisioned by Jane Lee in her Jaws Prize winning novel was to tell a BAD - like story from the point of view of the daughters , and to tell it a sort of late Friday century realistic way not considered by the Cat . The problem is , in Seagal and BAD 's story , the two older daughters are very human with strengths and weaknesses while the father is a most worthless character without much in the way of redeeming qualities . His only strength was his ability to make a financial success of the farm ; however , we can even push that since his father and grandfather before him built the farm and he inherited it . The second problem -- and this is one I can not personally take to , not having read Lee 's novel -- is that the movie is only a limited and partial interpretation of that novel . Still , it is almost always the case that an excellent novel , especially a long and ambitious one with many psychological nuances , can not be faithfully transferred to the screen . The vision and audio demands of film drown out the subtleties of a narration while the time constraints do n't allow for the full development of character and motivation achieved by the novelist . Given five or six hours , perhaps Moorhouse could have made a movie more in keeping with Smiley 's novel . A third problem is one that is perhaps Moorhouse 's alone . She began her directing career with the very well done Aussie film Proof ( 1991 ) starring Russell Crowe . She follow it up with How to Make an American Quilt ( 1995 ) which celebrated women , especially women of a certain age . However it was a bit heavy - handed and clearly and determinedly a chick flick . In a sense A Thousand Acres takes off from there , showing us not only the point of view of women , but does so in a way that may seem politically motivated to some . Larry Cook is clearly a bad , bad daddy . He beat his daughters and he had carnal knowledge of them . He ran the household with an iron fist . Jess ( Colin Firth 's character ) seduces the inexperienced Ginny and breaks her heart for nothing more than a bit of fun it would appear . And then he goes to Rose , who clearly is going to be the power behind the new ownership , and hooks up with her , while incidentally inducing her husband to end his life in a drunken accident . The rest of the men are one - dimensional characters without nuance , the way they often appear in romance novels . I think most audiences were put off by the heavy - handed incest , adultery and sexual betrayal that was woven into the story . Having said all this , I think the critics and the public are wrong . I think the direction was biased against men , but in this story it needed to be . I think Moorhouse did a fine job of making an emotional and engaging film about family dynamics that were none too pretty . And the acting by Pfeiffer and Lange was nothing short of sensational . They seemed to feed off of one another in a way that I found absolutely authentic and deeply moving . In particular Pfeiffer was riveting as she projected her bent - up anger and hatred . The way Moorhouse allowed her character to be revealed to us gradually is a tribute to her ability as a director as well as to Pfeiffer 's outstanding performance . And the skill with which Moorhouse guided the change in Ginny 's character as she went from a " ninny , " as she called herself , to someone with self - awareness and some understandable bitterness , was also excellent . The fact that she left her husband was as much out of shame as anything else . He needed to go get her and forgive her and bring her back . And Robards in his intensity and madness was also very good . I predict that this film , which bombed in theaters , will be better appreciated in the years to come as people see it on DVD . My question is , whatever happened to Moorhouse ? Her talent is obvious , but she has yet to director her fourth feature film . When she does I hope she remembers to go with what she believes but to be fair as well . I think , actually she was fair to the two lead character in this film , but did n't pay enough attention to the others . In addition to the unnuanced father , Jennifer Jason Leigh 's Caroline was unfinished , leaving us to wonder about why she did some of the things she did . And the husbands needed to be something more than mannequins . They needed to be engaged and involved . sub_rate: 0.024154589371980676; NE_rate: 0.0
Lee Sinatra has one of his best roles as a reformed heroin addict coming back to his Chicago neighborhood after an extensive stay in a clinic . He plans to stay off the drug and find work as a drummer , but he ca n't avoid running into his old friends . He had been arrested originally not for any drug - related charge , but because he was caught dealing in an illegal poker game . His attainment at poker has earned him the nickname of The Man with the Golden Arm , and the men who run the game , one of them being his former heroin connection , want him to deal again . Meanwhile , Frank has to take care of a woman whom he injured in a car accident , Zosch ( Eleanor Parker ) , and make up with his old girlfriend , Molly ( Kim Novak ) . The picture is neat at putting us in Sinatra 's mental state . When he feels sure of himself at the beginning of the film , I felt dear for him . But , when a promised phone call does n't come one day , he descends into depression and goes back on the smack . Later , when he finally gets to audition , he arrives completely strung out . His embarrassment when he ca n't play the correct beat is devastating . He had such big dreams , and the other musicians do n't even pay him a bit of attention as he rushes out of the room . The film moves quickly and it shows Frank 's drug problem in a realistic light without turning into a social substance exposure . The actors exist uniformly hunky . Elmer Bernstein 's grade is one of the best of its time . The only thing I do n't like about the film is the finish . SPOILERSAlthough I actually like the character of Zosch and Parker is really dear in the film , they could have done a little more to fill in her backstory . The ending is a slight overly pat . While there is surely pathos that will remain with the characters after the film closes , Zosch 's destruction ties up all the loose ends a bit too neatly . Frank is gratuitous to love Molly and he wo n't go to jail . Also , his dealer is dead , so at least the immediate threat is gone . Well , I guess in Hollywood there 's always a desire to tie everything up in a neat little package . It harms the film a little , but , as it stands , it 's still one of the best and most adult movies about drug addiction I can think of . 9/10 . sub_rate: 0.037894736842105266; NE_rate: 0.0
If one overlooks the technical problems of this early ( 1930 ) sound movie such as the sound quality and the occasional stiffness of John Wayne , one will find this movie to be an epic that is more realistic than almost any movie made since . Beginning at the Missouri , a large caravan of Conestoga wagons , people , and animals head west . The wagons are pulled down huge cliffs and cross a flooded river with considerable risk to the riders in the wagons . Indians meet with Wayne , and allow the train to pass through their land . Later , Indians gather west of the train to combat them . The wagons form a huge circle with horses and cattle in the circle , and fire their rifles creating with the circling Indians a veil of smoke . When the battle ends , the dead are buried on the spot and the people and wagons depart . This view is singular , as the camera stays with the dead as the living depart . It is unique in the way it links the viewer with the dead and separates the viewer from the living . The wagons encounter a major thunderstorm with torrential downpours and mud everywhere . They finally arrive at their destination near a redwood or sequoia forest in Oregon . The film is done in 70 mm widescreen at about a 2.0:1 ratio ( in 1930!).I have n't mentioned the plot because it is secondary to the scenic grandeur and the enormous amount of work involved in making this film . Moviemakers will never work this severe again to make such a movie or any movie . Given the technical limitations of the sound , the music is at times moving , such as when Wayne leaves his girl to hunt down his friend 's killers and at the end . While all the critics rave about The Searchers and Wayne 's psychology , racism , poor temper , and complex characters , The Big Trail gives us a story of simple people encountering extraordinary hardships . One of the best westerns I have seen . sub_rate: 0.01098901098901099; NE_rate: 0.0
L'Homme Blesse is not for an impatient, adventure-seeking audience. There are no explosions nor is the drama straightforward. Like the films of Lynne Ramsey, the director is working more deeply with mood than with storytelling in a manner that is effective and incredibly moving. Because it does not rely on gratuitous nudity, or superficial pop-cult. story lines, this is quite frankly one of the best gay foreign film I have seen (also, see Francois Ozon, Pedro Almodovar). Nicolas Roeg's "Don't Look Now" gets a lot of bad press because it is sold as a horror film. That film, like L'Homme, is more than what the box might lead you to believe. If you are in the mood to sit back and be absorbed by the subtle, transformed powers of cinema, you'll love this movie. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0

Do n't suffer me wrong this was fun to watch . It has some decent animation with exception of an uneven looking BAD , and some nice music . And the standout scene was definitely Elmer , Bugs and Daffy 's dance on the floor , that was such a decent and fun contact . As a matter of fact , the whole cartoon is decent to watch , but all in all it is not what I call especial like BAD . There are some very decent gags , but they have been used before I feel , and there was n't much that I would take hilarious . And Daffy joining forces with Elmer ? Somehow seeing as he was a target of the hunter , did n't it seem uneven that he would be friends with him . Though I will admit it was decent having Daffy there .

I was able to see " Anywhere But Here " last night as a free sneak preview . I perfectly LOVED the film ! I was drawn to it because of the realistic portrayal of a mother / daughter relationship ... there was definitely a connection between Adele a and Ann . I think that speaks volumes of the outstanding performances of both Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman . BAD was just the right actress to portray Adele and after leaving the theater I could not think of another actress in the role . Portman was also fantabulous as Ann . She brought a sense of maturity and intelligence to the role that I do n't think any other teenage actress could . I think it would the Academy of Motion BAD BAD BAD BAD should give credit where it is due and nominate both Sarandon and Portman for Awards in the " Actress " and " Supporting Actress " categories .

For further evidence crack out " unquestioned zero " . Lee is indeed dear in fact that before I watched " Jaws Jaws " , I thought that Lee Lee might not depend really credible in defeating him on cover . Lee Lee holds his own though and although he is n't rather equally acrobatic as Lee is , he can even complain with the best of them . All of the battle scenes in this movie exist really easily done and the grease battles exist above ordinary for this case of movie equally easily . The sole damaging affair I can suppose about this motion is that the floor is a little underdeveloped . I intend Lee Lee Lee reference 's motives should suffer been presented earlier in the motion , particularly in respect to why he carries around a rabbit . The reasonableness he does is really cool but you do n't happen out until the very destruction .

OK ... The end of this may be something of a letdown after what has come before ... And Klaus Kinski should have had his 10 second appearance cut out ... But there is no getting away from the fact that this is a actually wondrous atmospheric Euro thriller ... I ca n't believe I have never seen this till now ... Its good to know there are films out there that are still worth tracking down ... And this actually is ... sensational visuals ... Haunting ... And builds an awful air ... Florinda Balkan is utter as our heroine ... And the scene on the beach with Nicoletta Elmi is some of the most relaxed and perfect acting you could see ... Lila Kedrova is spot on as a fellow visitor to the town who may or may not be who she seems ... If you miss the hay days of Euro cinema then chase this out ... There 's a adequate widescreen print going round ... And please get this out in a restored DVD someone ... They did it with the directors " Fifth Cord " ...

Unfortunately , due to a sluggish start , I ca n't say that this is one of BAD 's best films . It very fantabulous none the less . The film stars Jimmy Stewart and Doris Day as parents who get caught up in a political assassination plot and must try to get their kidnapped son back . They both give excellent performances , not surprising of course . Really , however , I was most impressed with BAD awful use of music . The climax at the Opera house was fantastic , and using a live orchestra to create music and suspense at the same time was utter genius . utterly wild suspense came out of that scene . Also , the use of Doris Day singing " Que Sera , Sera " was excellent . Especially when it is transposed on scenes at the end of the film . So , this film to me ends up being BAD best use of music that I have seen to date . Unfortunately it had a slow start , or I could have recommend this film a slight more highly . Even then , it is still well worth a look . 8 out of 10 . sub_rate: 0.043478260869565216; NE_rate: 0.0
PUBLIC ENEMIES is a kind of throw - back to those early 1960 's gangster biographies like PORTRAIT OF A MOBSTER , MAD DOG COLL and KING OF THE ROARING TWENTIES . Although made on the cheap , the film has a great mess of energy and the acting over - all , particularly by Eric Roberts and Frank Stallone is quite dear . Theresa Russell might seem too glamorous as Ma , but she has some very good moments . There are two action scenes worth noting : a shoot - out in a hotel , and a machine gun fight in the middle of the street between the Barkers and the FBI . Both sequences are nicely done , and compared to other low - bidget gangster junk like DILLINGER AND CAPONE , this film shines . sub_rate: 0.014388489208633094; NE_rate: 0.0
... " Inglorious " as our local theater decided to display its title on their marquee , minus the second word . It is terrifying cinema . I do n't hesitate to recommend this film to all but the over - squeamish . Let them never know what they 're missing . I did hesitate to give it ten stars because of my experience of Tarantino 's previous films . In every case , save " Reservoir Dogs , " they have improved with additional watching . So although I gave it ten stars , I did so reluctantly . It leaves me no " up " to go to . Yes Christoph Waltz is the Nazi we ' ve all imagined the worst to be . He is cultured , sophisticated , suave and most sadistic , the kind of man who can make a glass of milk a threat and who puts out his cigarette abruptly in a strudel , grinding it into the whipped cream as if he were grinding his heel into a victim . To understand Tarantino 's films , you need only have a sense of dialogue , color and pacing . The colors are as bright as necessary and when necessary , brighter yet . In the French farmhouse of the opening scene , they are muted and dark , but indeed so . Outside smart brilliant sun is shining , but in the one room of the house , everything is bathed in shadows and black . It is a place setting for an interrogation BAD Waltz , as the " Jew Hunter " of BAD SS , who dangles his host French farmer over the precipice of revealing what he can not reveal numerous times , then pulls him back with obsequious lines of friendship reason understanding . A second sadistic German , well - played by August Diehl , later functions as important actor in the final wind twist BAD Diehl 's Nazi Major , who has an ear for German accents , virtually almost serious good as Waltz virtually almost . Film classes will study much from this movie . They should look lovingly at brilliant superb pacing . Tarantino hardly just how long suck draw out a scene , building suspense in the manner BAD Hitchcock , then hardly just the breaking point , suddenly coming to a resolution . For color , look for a final shot at a French Theater , where its secretly Jewish proprietor is staging a surprise for the upper reaches of Nazi leadership . We see her , played by Melanie Laurent , awaiting the hated German dignataries who will arrive for a film preview of the latest Deutsch film masterpiece , a propaganda piece about a German hero and his dubious accomplishments . Laurent is framed on a balcony , reflected in the glass mirrors of the gorgeous theater , her red lips and low cut dress reflecting everywhere the intensity of her designs on her guests . It is a single shot that would be worth an entire film . There are thankfully many more such images , many more paced scenes of exquisite dialog and suspense . In short , see it . I ' m sure you 'll see it again and again . sub_rate: 0.032490974729241874; NE_rate: 0.05555555555555555
When this showed at BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD I was the sole someone standing and clapping and cheering . The relief of the crew booed or was dumb .

It is virtually a actual humanity ; and does not run to the bland hyper - buffed brawny " festal paositive " that passes for the music of non - porn gay cinema ( and that is why therefore much of present homophile music movies exist thusly boring ) .

I ' ve tried to reconcile why so many bad reviews of this film , while the vast majority of reviews are given a rating of between 7 and 10 . The reason may be this film is kind of hard to describe in a positive review , although a few have done that quite nicely already . This film is confusing , depressing , and does n't have a happy ending . I still gave Pola X a rating of 10 , because it is basically for me literature and art combined on film . That is really my favorite kind of filmmaking . I ' ve only seen two of Carax 's films : this one and Mauvis Sang . As with this film , I fairly m being somewhat pretentious when I call BAD one of Carax 's best films- but I am . Carax has a minimalist style . If that type of film does not appeal to you and is boring , then it would be best not to watch this . But Pola X was less minimalist than Mauvis Sang , so it had quite a lot of intensity for a thriller- at least for my taste . I found it quite interesting and absorbing . The two lead fantabulous did an excellent job acting . ( I mean the lead and the young woman he thought was his half sister . ) Catherine D. is always great , but her role was not very large or significant in the story . But everyone did a fine job . I thought the cult stuff was great . It may have not been very believable , but that is due to its being rather abstract . There is a mess going on between the lines in this film . This is a very Freudian psycho - thriller . sub_rate: 0.012903225806451613; NE_rate: 0.0

Unlike some of the former commentators , I was ( and am ) an greedy fan of the Carpenters . Face it , Christmas would never be Christmas without The Carpenters . That said , I believe the movie did a good , not excellent , job at depicting Karen 's life . The movie was enjoyable to see on primetime TV , but the content fell a little short . I suggest that you all look into getting some of the Carpenters specials that were shown in the 70 's . You can not believe how awful a drummer Karen was . Cynthia did not capture the extent of Karen 's talent . too , Karen was beautiful but had a bad hairdresser . My choice for playing Karen is Hilary Swank . I would love to see a more substantive story , because there was more to Karen than meets the eyes when listening to We ' ve Only Just Begun .

From the first to the last scene of the movie , director Visconti excels at his art , to the extent that the movie is ensured to remain as a cultural treasure for only God knows how long . It is perfection - as a movie , that is , but the story has some minor shortcomings . Thomas Mann 's novel is also a utter piece of art , so of course it is impossible to bring into another media . Visconti follows the story pretty practically , and it is only when he allows himself to deviate slightly , that the transition falters . And no matter how wondrous the scenery is , the tension in the air between the characters , the hundreds of subtle signals and allegories , the almost unbearably heightened serving of Mahler 's music - still , the minute anomalies in the plot disturb me . Maybe I ' m just a victim of man 's desire to flaw the flawless . Nevertheless , I will offer one example , which I regard as crucial . WARNING : SPOILERSIn Mann 's story , Aschenbach eats the strawberries which probably contain the disease that will kill him , after giving up his frustrated chase of the boy Tadzio in Venice . Unable to catch one delight , he settles for another - which poisons him . It is pernicious subtle in the book , but it is there . The forbidden fruit , of sorts , but more a sign of him surrendering life itself . In Visconti 's film , he also eats strawberries , but in a rather insignificant scene by the beach . The chase in Venice ends in a much more melodramatic way . It works , too , but lacks some subtlety , indeed , and also the multi - layered symbolism , giving food for thought . But that 's all forgiven , when the film allows us to feast on beautiful sceneries , faces and constellations , and certainly as many other symbols as we can possibly digest - the last gesture of Tadzio , standing in the water , being the equally sublime and mysterious finale . sub_rate: 0.010810810810810811; NE_rate: 0.0
If you are like me and you bought the new Tenacious D album the day it came out , and went into the film knowing all the lyrics to all the songs .... then you will CERTAINLY enjoy this film . Yes I am biased as a huge Tenacious D fan , but i really did like this film which made me chuckle quite a mess . This motion was pretty much everything I expected . Comedic genius backed up by neat songwriting and some large cameos from Ben Stiller and Tim Robbins . I specially enjoyed Tim Robbins ' part . If , however , you are unfamiliar with Tenacious BAD 's BAD series and fantastic debut album , then this may not have quite the same comedic impact on you .

Movie about two Australian girls -- Debbie ( Nell Schofield ) and Sue ( Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surfer guys . I caught this at an art cinema here in America in 1981 . Technically I was still a teenager ( I was 19 ) so I was interested in seeing how Australian teens acted . Script wise there 's nothing new here . It shows the usual teenage adventures dealing with dating , sex , suicide etc etc . I always knew what was going to happen before it did but I was never bored . What I found interesting was , despite the accent and a few changes in clothes and hair , these teenagers are n't much different than American teens . They had many of the same difficulties and hang - ups . Also this was based on a book from a real surfer girl and her true life adventures and ( I heard ) it was a faithful adaptation of it . The acting was just OK but the actors were attractive and this was well - made and somewhat interesting . So this is no unsung masterpiece but a somewhat precise portrayal of what it 's like being a teenager and trying to be with the popular kids . I give it a 7 . sub_rate: 0.013215859030837005; NE_rate: 0.0
They were alternative before there was alternative , The Residents are a band like no other , and I love them for it .

But that is just the beginning . As a bonus it even has BAD & BAD Loafs hauntingly beautiful ' Songs for Swinging Larvae ' and even features The Residents cover of it .

Being featured at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival and gaining quite some fame , this movie appears to be another modern and profound school drama . It 's about a bunch of adolescents who get through a revealing and desperate day at school . Everything 's circling around a suicide - shown at the very beginning to some extent - that happens at 2:37pm . The characters are somehow all connected with each other . What moves them is described via short interview sequences , strictly shot in b / w . The characters are well written , the acting is intriguing ( especially Teresa Palmer as Melody and Frank Sweet as Marcus are discoveries).Let 's stick to the movies ' technique . That 's what really impressed me . There rarely are cuts , most of the time the camera follows one of the protagonists like in Gus van Sants ' Elephant . Some scenes are presented more often than once , but each time from a different point of view ( here : character ) . This surely evokes a slowly developing , but grabbing atmosphere that drags you inside literally . The colours are vibrant , somehow unfitting considering the tough plot - but that 's nothing less than a clever contrast , a disturbing ' everything 's fine thing ' . The use of lighting is adequate all the time , underlining the characters ' actual mood . And finally , there are decent placements of music.2:37 somehow itches you from the very beginning . It does not compromise nor does it serve laughter . It rather strings together what psychologists would define as terror moments . This movie substantially focuses on emotional precipices . There ai n't nobody who 's not to handle some kind of neurosis , even the depicted minor parts ( e.g. the teachers ) seem to be in some state of disorder . And that is what keeps this movie from being actually dear . Its summing up of piercing tragedies is unrealistic to its very bones . There is no : friendship , love , smiling , truth , heat . There is : faking , humiliation , desperation , sickness and beating up . It 's like being hit in the face real hard all the time , but you are numb after the minutes minutes . This flick keeps on hitting you , until it reveals something quite instructive in the end . For being sensitively and superbly acted : 9 . For being technically innovative and original : 9 . For being unidimensional : 3.Makes a solid 7 out of 10 . sub_rate: 0.01348314606741573; NE_rate: 0.0

BAD and June was one of the classic British sitcoms in my opinion . You knew what to expect - and ai n't that just so typical ! :) Unlike modern sitcoms with utterly contrived plots , this show is even a breath of fresh air . How lovely not see or hear remarks about bodily functions or not to see a family PERPETUALLY late for breakfast or a family with impossible teenagers . And therein is the secret : Terry & June was based on a middle class couple living in relative harmony in stead of today 's strained plots with the ' de rigueur ' dysfunctional family ( made to look hip).Personally , I vote the " Bridge to far " episode as one of the best . In a way , Terry 's antics reminds me of Basil Fawlty - both sometimes getting almost impossibly embarrassing!Terry & June comes highly recommended .

This is a phenomenal motion . unfeignedly one of the best movies I have ever watched . I am a serious critic and it takes much to stir me , but this movie had all the right combinations for " stirring " . The passion of the actors , without the overacting , the aching for all the characters involved , the serious and subtle truths about marriage and divorce , all make this a must see movie , despite the fact that it is 1970s . This is definitely not an " old movie " , but a classic / vintage movie . I hope you engage with it as I did when you consider how volatile relationships of all kinds can be , when you also consider how deep pain associated with love can be and how the hardest decisions to make will always be the most terrible , but once they are made the pain will subside , but only gradually . This movie certainly demonstrates that the most volatile relationships are not necessarily weak relationships and that leaving certainly is not synonymous with lost / lack of love . The ' crafting ' of this movie certainly emanates from a place deep within someone 's heart and mind . sub_rate: 0.014084507042253521; NE_rate: 0.0

This is a gripping report that borrows elements from the Kennedy assassination , and uses them successfully to make an fantabulous western story . The movie has a serious music score , though it relies on repeating the claim theme a slight too practically . Giuliano Gemma and the rest of the mold exist brilliant . This is a more cerebral than usual spaghetti western that relies more on story than action , and it succeeds because the report is fantabulous . This is not to say that there is no action in the movie . There is mess , and it is really easily crafted . This motion pulls you in right away , and keeps you absorbed til the destruction . You 'll always be wondering what 's in those documents everyone 's after . It also has some biting commentary on American politics . This movie shows why Valerii , in my opinion , is in a three way tie with Sollima and Corbucci for second place in the rankings of spaghetti western directors . sub_rate: 0.10112359550561797; NE_rate: 0.0
NVA combines eastalgia - humor , military comedy and teen movie . Although it is somehow typically German - movie - like sentimental , I think it 's a great and very laughable movie . You will not only laugh in NVA but also get a bit of an insight in the Eastern Germany armed forces of the late 1980ies and how the young recruits as well as the professional soldiers experienced the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the German Democratic Republic . You will enjoy NVA if you liked Sonnenallee ( another movie directed by Leander Haußmann ) , but not necessarily if you enjoyed Good Bye Lenin which is much more serious and less obviously funny .

In a critical scene , as Katharine Clifton ( Kristin Scott Thomas ) lies in the Cave Of Swimmers , she writes something read aloud by Hana ( Juliette Binoche ) in which she proclaims that " the light has gone out now , and I ' m writing in the darkness ... " A sentence of such poetic beauty could not be more perfect for the cinematic brilliance of the far from tiresome The English Patient . With such a dramatic sweep that keeps one firmly on their feet , and a strength about the film that does n't let up , this film proudly celebrates the mysteries and romances of World War II , taking elements of Casablanca and Lawrence Of Arabia along with some independence in the form of Tuscany . The English Patient unabashedly pulls the heartstrings and takes us through a mysterious first act , a romantic number act , and a beautiful ... beautiful number act , and it is hardly just the rate pace and setting , it 's the performance of Ralph Fiennes , who keeps us sympathetic even when Count Almásy , from the very start , proves to be a thoroughly unlikable character . Usually typecast as a villain , he corrupt tainted , but ultimately human colours as a man taken in by a desperate love that he must fulfill . Many will criticize this film based on its so called " glorification of adulterers " , but those who do know nothing . The contrasts between the two periods ( before and after the plane crash seen at the start ) are spectacular , as the patient is the piece man who suffers because of what he did , the evil that was once in him now absent , whereas the man of before the crash is an individual like anyone else . He wants this woman but he can not have her , Fiennes brings the human - like qualities out of Almásy in direction utterly absolutely NO OTHER actor could . There could n't have been a better actor for the job . So please , take these comments to heart , see the film , those who call it " boring " or worthless despicable " know nothing , and should be ashamed of such a one - dimensional view on the film , a view that they have neither studied nor corrected , and probably do n't plan on correcting . The English Patient is the best of every film to have ever won the Best Picture Oscar , and for so many reasons , hidden in their poetic triumphs . sub_rate: 0.02242152466367713; NE_rate: 0.0

Our favorite dark horse detective suspects a pair of identical twin brothers of killing their rich uncle ; each points the finger at his brother . In a mystery series in which the crime is shown at the beginning of the drama , this twist could reasonably be used only once or twice , and this was Columbo 's time . Other than that wrinkle , this episode fits in well with others of the series .

While I agree that this movie lacks any real substance and should not be taken seriously , its primarily directed to fans of the series who are looking for a ready mess . Bronson ( Paul Kersey)once again takes to the streets ( given a license to kill by the chief police no less ) and moves into his friends apartment ( who you guessed it ) was killed by a street gang that has taken control of the neighborhood ( which looks like Beruit ) . It 's laughable that people who associate with Bronson have a habit of getting killed . Bronson systematically kills them off one by one as the people in the neighborhood are used against him . There are some dynamics between Bronson and Fraker who leads the street gang , you can tell they both enjoy their work . At one point in the movie after they scuffle in the city jail , Fraker say 's , " I ' m going to kill a little old lady just for you , catch it on the 6:00 news . " The " Giggler " , a purse thief who laughs as he 's committing his crimes too pleasurable enjoyable to watch . The movie was made in 1985 and most people probably could identify with the stereotypical urban gangs that are cast in the movie .

As the film progressed we were introduced to the characters of the film , as well as what happened in the prison riots . Like most reviews for this film , I have to admit that there is some unessecary cliches but it ca n't erase the overall power of this film that reads like a good novel .

Although I have n't seen it yet , I know that Chaplin is a brain , and only someone of his talent would take on this daring subject matter -- a comedy about Hitler . All heavy satire is based on going out on an edge . likewise , all heavy comedy deals with the other side -- pathos . This film seems like it will skirt both sides . Like Kubrick 's Dr. Strangelove , The heavy Dictator deals with history through the ill lens of satire . The only way to deal with the horrors of this mankind is by laughing at it . And hopefully , through laughter , we can learn to view the world in a new light . Another film that does this that comes to my mind is Emir Kusturica 's Underground , and BAD BAD BAD .

Jump to 'June 1995' & Los Angeles where the now adult Cutter (Don 'The Dragon' Wilson, also credited as co-producer) has but four names left in the book including, Argento (Vince Murdocco) & Carmella (Sophia Crawford) together they are the last of the American Vampires. As they all dine in a restaurant Cutter crashes the party & kills them, job done right? Wrong as King of the Vampires Bruno Fischer (Nicholas Guest) calls in the last four remaining Vampires from around the world, the French Tournier (Maria Ford), the Asian Hashimoto (Ron Yuan), Ulmer (David 'Shark Fralick) & Sangster (Vincent Klyn) to track Cutter down & kill him. Meanwhile Detective's Hooper (Marcus Aurelius) & Browning (Cash Casey) don't have a clue & a nosey reporter named Raimy Baker (Melanie Smith) becomes involved in the battle between Cutter & the Vampire's on which the very fate of Earth rests!Directed by Rick Jacobson I thought Night Hunter was quite a fun way to pass 85 odd minutes. The script by William C. Martell mixes martial arts & horror with a fair degree of success, it moves along at a nice pace & is at least never boring & thankfully doesn't seem to take itself too seriously. The character names that reference other horror film director's/actors are a little tacky though. Some may be surprised at how closely Night Hunter resembles Blade (1998) yet was made a couple of years prior, the lone moody long coat wearing Vampire hunter who happens to be an expert in martial arts, the scene set in a nightclub & the innocent woman drawn into the world of Vampire's. Night Hunter doesn't really stick to traditional Vampire film law, for instance sunlight only irritates their eye's, they can only breed on a solar eclipse (why?), stakes through the heart & garlic is no good as the way to kill a Vampire in Night Hunter is to break it's neck. I could have done with a bit more horror & a bit more blood as it leans more towards the martial arts side of things. The dialogue is suitably cheesy & the character's are just about likable enough in a silly way.Director Jacobson does his best to ruin the film, the actions scenes are OK but lack a certain something & for some bizarre reason whenever an action sequence takes place he shakes his camera constantly, it's like the camera is placed upon a washing machine full cycle! Hey Rick, mate, it's not clever or stylish it's irritating & annoying. The gore is disappointing with a few gory gunshot wounds & a few splashes of blood, breaking Vampire's necks don't involve much blood unfortunately.With a budget that probably didn't amount to much Night Hunter is competently made throughout. The acting was bad most of the time & what's with 'The Dragon' thing in Don 'The Dragon' Wilson's name? Has he legally changed his name? Does he sign cheques Don 'The Dragon' Wilson?! Does he get mail addressed to him in that name? I think I might do something like this, from now on I want to be known as Paul 'The Killer Klown' Andrews...Night Hunter is one of those crap films that transcends it's limitations & awfulness to become pure golden entertainment. If you like your films fun then Night Hunter might be for you, if your looking for big-budget thrills in a similar vein (! Vampire's, veins & blood get it?) then Blade & it's sequels would probably be a better choice. What the hell, I liked it so sue me. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
One unfortunate reality of post - Soviet Russia was that the people 's welfare did n't change much from Soviet times . As we see in " Window to Paris " , most people are still equally depressed as ever , while they are encouraged to go after money . Then , everything changes for music teacher Nikolai Chizhov ( Sergei Dontsov ) after he finds a window that leads to Paris . He and his friends are naturally rather amazed at what they find . This movie has one of the funniest discussions of Elvis Presley and Edith Piaf that I ' ve ever heard . So watch this movie . You 're sure to love it . It 's sort of a precursor to " Being John Malkovich " . sub_rate: 0.015267175572519083; NE_rate: 0.0

My 2nd favorite film of 1970 ( after Five Easy Pieces ) was totally dismissed by a lot of idiots , calling in an audience - baiting piece of trash . Peter Boyle , a well - known liberal , is incredible as the hard - assed working stiff who has a few problems with the younger generation . He 's a frightening dude , but has a great imagination and is very laughable . I was a teenage liberal when this was released , but as horrifying as Joe seemed to me , he also cracked me up ! Susan Sarandon , in her first role , is perfect and a mixed - up stone rich fox . The dinner scene in Queens is hilarious and insightful for everybody involved . This WAS NOT an exploitation film and the script ( which was Oscar - nominated ) should have won that year . The director just did n't WASTE enough money making it to give it enough credibility in Hollywood . No matter your political pursuasion , then and now , you 'll like somebody in this film . A definite 9 out of 10 . It 's on DVD and video . Check it out ! sub_rate: 0.004807692307692308; NE_rate: 0.0
Lee Lee is the eponymous heroine of this attractively measured cogitation of a minor Christian community towards Friday Friday Friday Friday Friday Friday . zero beautiful and musically talented sisters have - up their own prospects of felicity and man in purchase to seem - after their ageing father . One daylight , a Christian womanhood , BAD , comes to turn for them . After Friday Friday she wins the drawing and is compulsive to make something for the sisters who possess taken her in . Her answer is to make an exquisite and opulent feast , which changes the lives of all those invited . This is a motion about human and ethnical interaction , reflected in the changing nomenclature of the dialog from Christian to Christian , and peculiarly between the duteous somberness of Malta Malta Malta and the sensuousness of the Christian Confederacy . It is too about human needs , and how affectionateness and benignity can be expressed and stimulated through the refinement of the senses .

I thought the movie started out a piece tedious and disjointed for the first hour . However , it became more absorbing , fascinating , and surprising in its last two hours . So , while it starts out like a cheap horror picture , it evolves into a beautiful and wondrous fantasy film . Bridget Fonda stands out as the Snow Queen . This was her best operation and it is sad that this apparently was her last performance , as she has not acted in the last 7 years . She absolutely personifies both the beauty and coldness of Winter . My daughter , age 14 , found the film a bit frightening , so if you are showing it as family entertainment , please stay with your child and reassure her or him that it is just a fairy tale fantasy and not to take it too seriously . It is really one of the best illusion films that I have seen in a long time , slightly better than " Eragon " or any of the " Lord of the Rings . " It is about as dear as " The Golden Compass " . sub_rate: 0.035175879396984924; NE_rate: 0.0
I 'll be brief : I normally hate films like this venomously ... but there is just something about this one that just draws me in and wo n't let me go . Granted , there are some major flaws in it ( some of the acting is below par at best and the dialogue is sometimes so poor it 's laughable ) but there are enough redeeming features to make it watchable to the end . But what are they ? Well , it 's got a cool little plot - by no means is it original , but it is better presented than other films of its kind . The three main stars ( Whalin , Johnson , Long ) put in fairly decent performances that more than make up for the distinct lack of quality from the supporting cast ( the fat cop and Coach Quinn really bugged me ) , and the scripting is slick and witty ( even if it is poor in places).The bottom line is , though , this film is so CUTE : I grinned all the way through it and it has a place in my video collection purely because it could cheer up anybody . You really have to be some kind of humourless bore not to like this ( I DARE somebody to sit through this without grinning!!!).I do recommend this one if you want a simple , fun , and - above all - enjoyable watch . You wo n't regret it!~Top$~ sub_rate: 0.003937007874015748; NE_rate: 0.0
Delightful ! It never pretends to be a masterpiece , but it 's a mini - gemstone of tardy seventies Christian drollery . Given that the producers wanted to sell it overseas , it stars an Christian ( the tardy case histrion Lee Lee ) , but at least he is n't the common dense Seagal hunk case . Surrounding him is the emollient of Christian type playacting gift , led by a marvelously waspish and superior Lee Lee . Friday 's Ivan the Terrible of gets the best zero liners and all the best response shots . He too manages to be astonishingly ominous and intimidatingly grievous . The minute in the snooker golf when he drops the sorcerous window and threatens Lee Lee will derive as a cushion to those viewers who intend of Friday as being exclusively a promiscuous drawing way drollery superstar . He is filled with unfeigned tycoon and mercilessness as we hear wholly at formerly how Lee earned his nickname . All the more surprising given how ominous Lee was at the meter . concisely after filming this yield he lost his powers of lecture to BAD BAD BAD ( known as Lee Lee Lee disease ) . This is the final characterisation Lee made where you can try his own representative , being dubbed thereafter by the risible impressionist Lee Lee . Alongside him you can recognise numerous conversant faces from seventies cinema and boob . Lee Lee ( flashing her breasts in rightful seventies era politically wrong bimbo way ) , Lee Lee , Lee Lee , Lee Lee , Lee Lee etc , etc .

primitively supposed to be merely a piece of a vast epic The Friday Friday depicting Hugo Hugo Hugo Hugo , Lee is the floor of the mutiny of the crew of the Christian in Malta harbor . The movie opens with the crew protesting maggoty substance and the police ordering the death of the dissidents . An insurrection takes situation during which the radical loss is killed . This crew is taken to the shoring to lie in body . When the town gather on a vast flight of stairs overlooking the harbor , czaristic troops appear and march down the stairs breaking up the crew . A naval squadron is sent to retake the Grigori but at the minute when the ships do into chain , their crews allow the mutineers to blow through . Lee 's non - historically precise conclusion is open - complete therefore indicating that this was the source of the afterwards red gyration that would bloom in Seagal . The motion is broken into zero parts : humans and Lee , drama on the quarterdeck , An solicitation from the utter , Lee Lee Lee , and Meeting the squadron . Lee was a radical artist , but at the brain floor . Not wanting to lay a historic drama , Lee used optical grain to throw the picture a newsreel - face so that the witness feels he is eavesdropping on a thrilling and politically radical floor . This technique is used by Lee 's The Battle of Algiers . Lee Lee , Lee relied on typage , or the cast of non - professionals who had striking forcible appearances . The sinful faces of the shape exist what zero remembers from Lee . This technique is afterwards used by Lee Lee in Mr Lee Lee to Ithiel and meet Lee Lee . But in Lee , no zero someone is cast as a submarine or heroine . The floor is told through a series of scenes that exist combined in a extra impression known as collage -- the redaction and choice of poor segments to raise a desired impression on the witness . Lee Lee too used the collage , but no unity mastered it indeed easily as Lee . The esthetic cinematography of the crew sleeping in their hammocks is complemented by the elegant swing of tables suspended from irons in the galley . In contrast the confrontation between the crew and their officers is charged with electricity and the clenched fists of the masses demonstrate their rage with injustice . Eisenstein introduced the technique of showing an action and repeating it again but from a slightly different angle to demonstrate intensity . The breaking of a plate bearing the words " Give Us This Day Our Daily Bread " signifies the beginning of the end . This technique is used in Last Year at Marienbad . Also , when the ship 's surgeon is tossed over the side , his pince - nez dangles from the rigging . It was these glasses that the officer used to inspect and pass the maggot - infested meat . This sequence ties the punishment to the corruption of the czarist - era . The most noted sequence in the film , and perhaps in all of film history , is The Odessa Steps . The broad expanse of the steps are filled with hundreds of extras . Rapid and dramatic violence is always suggested and not explicit yet the visual images of the deaths of a few will last in the minds of the viewer forever . The angular shots of marching boots and legs descending the steps are cleverly accentuated with long menacing shadows from a sun at the top of the steps . The pace of the sequence is deliberately varied between the marching soldiers and a few civilians who summon up courage to beg them to stop . A close up of a woman 's face frozen in horror after being struck by a soldier 's sword is the direct antecedent of the bank teller in Bonnie in Clyde and gives a lasting impression of the horror of the czarist regime . The death of a young mother leads to a baby carriage careening down the steps in a sequence that has been copied by Hitchcock in Foreign Correspondent , by Terry Gilliam in Brazil , and Brian DePalma in The Untouchables . This sequence is shown repeatedly from various angles thus drawing out what probably was only a five second event . Potemkin is a film that immortalizes the revolutionary spirit , celebrates it for those already committed , and propagandizes it for the unconverted . It seethes of fire and roars with the senseless injustices of the decadent czarist regime . Its greatest impact has been on film students who have borrowed and only slightly improved on techniques invented in Russia several generations ago . sub_rate: 0.1475211608222491; NE_rate: 0.08196721311475409

The Thing is a milestone in picture - making and remains zero of my preferent films of all - time . Despite the film 's roots in science - fiction it is ultimately a horror film that brightly balances splatter with psychological trauma . Today , Over twenty five years after its release , the special effects stand up as an example of vapourous grandness and effects man Rob Bottin suffered a complete physical breakdown for his art . It would be impossible to make the same movie today as the Studio would most certainly insist on casting a female character or a BAD BAD BAD type . An totally - male BAD BAD team in Antarctica are thrown into turmoil when an alien lifeform able to perfectly absorb and imitate other lifeforms infiltrates their camp . Their trust in each other steadily crumbles as they become increasingly unsure who is real and who is an imitation , and this ' body - snatchers ' scenario sees their numbers steadily dwindle as one - by - one , they fall victim to The Thing . When cornered , it manifests itself as a different nightmarish creature , the metamorphosis always terrible and compelling . The helplessness , isolation and claustrophobia of a team of desperate men with no way out of their situation and no way of help reaching them is expertly sustained . The minutes hours of darkness and the mounting snowfall provide a bleak backdrop to the terror that unfolds . Director John Carpenter selected with large aid a team of brilliant character - actors and each member of the team fits utterly into the part they play , whether it be the young and street - wise chef , the elderly and wise Doctor or the bitter and cynical helicopter pilot . The point is that no - one here comes close to being an all - American badass superhero with blonde locks and a six - pack and the film 's real strength is thanks in no small part to this bleak realism . The masses suffering on - screen are recognisable in our daily lives . The Thing remains systematically pleasurable and affecting even after repeated viewings . I have now seen the film on more than twenty separate occasions and my amazement at the quality of the direction , the acting and the special effects is unwavering . My girlfriend prefers the high - school spin - off of the film -The Faculty- which is good and solid entertainment but far more light - hearted and whistful . She still loves and acknowledges the brilliance of The Thing however , and thank goodness for that ... Because I could not remain in the company of someone who did n't love this movie . A classic and then some . sub_rate: 0.04421052631578947; NE_rate: 0.09523809523809523

During the Clete Roberts preface , I was beginning to think this was an Ed Wood production , however , what rolls out here is some pretty hard hitting stuff . The story of crime and corruption in a Southern town is told using a cast culled from Hollywood 's Poverty Row , and this makes the movie all the more realistic . There are no punches pulled here , and at times the film is reminiscent of " The Well"(1951 ) . BAD Black and BAD texture gives a newsreel - like quality .

If you 're looking for an original horror flick , this might be the one for you . It 's strange and at times lingers on stupidity , but it 's just such a good looking , nice sounding and original movie , it never fails , except maybe during the over long climax . " Nightbreed " is a must see for horror fans , or for fans of monster movie make - up . Boone ( Craig Sheffer ) has been having dreams of a town called Midian full of mutant creatures . In therapy , his psychiatrist Dr. Decker ( horror director David Cronenberg ) has come to the conclusion that BAD is a murderer , and gives him hallucinogenic pills , and tells him to turn himself in . After almost getting killed , Boone ends up at the hospital , where he runs into a mental patient who also knows about Midian , and tells Boone where to go . Midian , located in a graveyard , is inhabited by worthless mutant creatures that do n't let Boone in . After escaping with only a nasty bite , Boone is shot dead by the police , who were lead to his location by Dr. Decker . But BAD is n't dead . The bite causes him to live , and he goes off to Midian . Meanwhile , Boone 's girlfriend Lori ( Anne Bobby ) tries to find Boone and get to the bottom of this . When Dr. Decker also finds out about this place , chaos ensues . The plot seems long and complicated , but it really is n't hard to understand . The plot , among other things , makes this movie really interesting . The make - up effects are astounding . The creatures look unique and awful , and make this a very likeable film . To add to more senses appeal , we have a musical score by Danny Elfman , that is both lush and bouncy , and fits the film like a glove . The shots in the movie are also set up beautifully . The cinematography is adorable , and the movie sets up an atmosphere that is never broken . Even the acting is good , with the biggest surprise being director David Cronenberg giving a expectant , ominous performance as the man , who for one reason or another , wants to see Boone dead . It 's odd for a horror film to be this well done . The problems with the movie ... well there are a few , but the positives outweigh the negatives . The script features the occasional lame jokes to try and add some humor , but almost every one falls flat . The mutant creatures look great and for the most part are well acted , but sometimes it feels like they are just posing their awesome makeup for the camera . The worst part of the film would have to be the climax . It takes so long , and is just constant chaos . It 's the portion of the film that moves from individual characters and nice tight knit shots , to fiery explosions from each direction and violence happening to characters we do n't know or care about . Overall , this movie is amazing to look at . It 's a well done horror film , but even with that said , it has the occasional failure in character 's lines , and a messy climax . Nonetheless , this is one to check out . My rating : * * * out of * * * * . 101 mins . R for strong violence and language . sub_rate: 0.012718600953895072; NE_rate: 0.0
One of the best of the ' kitchen - sinks ' . wondrous views of London and invaluable snippets of working class life of the 60 's . Loach 's eye seems to capture everything , yet makes no judgment - a taste of things to come . As with ' Kes ' , ' Riff - raff ' and ' Sweet Sixteen ' , it serves as a cinematic social history of Britain . Carol White is altogether convincing , you love her , fancy her , want to take care of her , but hold your head at her self - destructive decisions and still follow her in some vain hope . Well backed up by Terence Stamp , ( fresh off ' The collector ' , also catch ' The Hit ' ) and a embarrassment of English faces ( all looking very young ) . Pefectly set to Donovan 's dulcet tones . Stamp sings ' Yellow is the color ' , in a adorable scene , ending with him saying , " Getting better , ai n't I " ( song also used in ' The rules of Attraction ' - I think ) Watch Carol Whites screen mum getting ready to ' go out and get a bloke ' , putting on her false eye - lashes to the sound of ' Rosie ' on the radio - priceless .

I was a teenager ( 14 ) at the time of the release of this film so I can identify with many of the same problems / dilemmas that the campers / CIT 's in this movie have . I enjoy seeing the clothes that were worn at this time and hearing the same old urban legends such as was told on the overnight canoe trip . The film is also full laughable funny one liners .

I just watched Nightbreed for the first time since seeing it in the theater almost 20 years ago , and while I remember liking it at the time , I do n't remember being blown away by it like I was today . I really ca n't complain about anything in this movie . Craig Scheffer is excellent as the lead character of Boone . I never understood why he has n't had a more successful career , because most of his early work is outstanding . As serious as Scheffer is , Cronenberg is even better . His portrayal of the psycho Dr. Decker is unforgettable , and steals the show . The rest of the cast , which includes Doug Bradley is very unspoiled , save for the ridiculously over the top redneck sheriff . The visuals are good , and in some shots great . The Danny Elfman composed score is as serious as it gets , and is among his best work . The ending was epic , with nonstop action for close to twenty minutes . Overall , Nightbreed is a terrible accomplishment for Clive Barker , and ranks as my favorite of his movies , just slightly ahead of Hellraiser . 9/10 sub_rate: 0.019230769230769232; NE_rate: 0.0
I watched pp minutes minutes night . I have to say I was really impressed with how actual the film seemed . It felt very practically like a documentary . I too think that the picture presented realistic possibilities . In the film the war in Seagal escalates to the point where China has become involved . What if that had happened ?

I did n't like " As Good as it Gets " very practically , but I am a bad fan of William Hurt and Holly Hunter 's work , so I decided to watch this picture . And the most surprising thing for me was the brilliant work of Albert Brooks . Here , in Spain , he 's little - known , and only as a 2nd division version of Woody Allen in the West Coast . He played a great part , but Hunter and Hurt were good too , specially Hurt , in an relatively unusual role for him . Hunter played the role that reminds me a bit of her part in " Once Around " ( Lasse Hallstrom , 1991).Finally , the rest of the mold is neat , overly . Robert Prosky , one of these familiar faces of the american cinema , the ex - bond girl Lois Chiles , pretty good placed on that role , I think , the always utter Joan Cusack in her early years ; and specially the brief appereance of Jack Nicholson . Maybe he does n't suffer any good scene , but it 's Jack Nicholson , anyways ... The Best movie by James Lee , neat report ( well resolved ) , and superb cast for one of the , surely , best movies of the 80 's sub_rate: 0.055793991416309016; NE_rate: 0.0
More of a near miss than a flop , MR . IMPERIUM stars Ezio Pinza as Alex , heir apparent to and later king of a small European nation , who falls in love with a willing American actress and entertainer , Fredda Barlo ( Lana Turner ) , but due to machinations by the sly prime minister of Alex as king , nicely played by Cedric Hardwicke , the lovers are separated for 12 years before being reunited in Palm Springs where their love is rekindled . Director Don Hartman , who also scripts , is not able to fully utilize his talent for snappy dialogue because of Pinza 's tentative English usage , and the requisite rewriting , coupled with less than total rapport in evidence between the two stars , results in a somewhat raggedy tone to the screenplay , exacerbated by the studio 's unkind cutting of many scenes , leading to a confusing ending . The overpowering Pinza dominates his scenes with BAD , but both performers score with good work , while Marjorie Main is impressive with her patter effects as written , with Debbie Reynolds placed on track by Louis B. Mayer for SINGIN ' IN THE RAIN as a result of her sprightly performance here ; only Barry Sullivan is heavily victimized by the flagrant cutting . Prettily filmed largely in Pebble Beach , California , and other Monterey County environs , the film is endowed with BAD 's iron strong operatic basso in Solamente Una Vez , as well as with original songs by Harold Arlen and Dorothy Fields , with Douglas Shearer splendidly handling the sound recording , and notice must be made of the fine set decorations by Edwin Willis , and the effective costume designs by Walter Plunkett . sub_rate: 0.006644518272425249; NE_rate: 1.0
And a severe spot somewhere else . I have n't seen this movie since i was quite young , maybe 12 or 13 , who knows . But what i do know is this is the movie that taught me how to masturbate . I kid you not . I have no idea if it is any good by any real standards of today , but for me , back then , it was everything . The only reason i feel comfortable writing this is because i 'm sure no one will ever get around to reading it . I mean , really , who is going to look up this movie these days?I just discovered that i have not yet used up the ten line minimum for the amount of length i most take up in a review . i had no idea there was such a minimum length , but there i go , like a student trying to fill up a page in a journal , my ten lines . thank you very much . sub_rate: 0.0056179775280898875; NE_rate: 0.0
I actually enjoyed watching Hell to Pay . I 've been a fan of Westerns for as long as I can remember and this one reminded me of a lot of the Westerns from the 1960s ( even though I was too young to have seen them in their first run ) . The one thing that bothered me about the movie was the constant music . It was distracting at times . One thing I did notice , and I wonder how many other fans of Gunsmoke noticed , was the name of Buck Taylor 's character . It was a play on Doc Adams ' name from Gunsmoke . Instead of Gaylan Adams , Buck Taylor used Adam Galen . I wonder if that was his choice or Chris McIntyre 's ? Anyway , I would recommend this movie to fans of Westerns . Do n't expect anything too " deep " . Just plain old entertainment . sub_rate: 0.00625; NE_rate: 0.0
Based on the true story about Christopher Boyce ( BAD ) and Daulton Lee ( Penn ) , and their involvement in selling American secret Government documents to the Soviets during the 1970s . Boyce works for the Government , and his job is to guard these particular documents , which ultimately disillusions him about his Country 's affairs and practices . He then enlists his drug - dealer friend , Daulton Lee , who has become a wanted man , to be the courier for these sensitive documents . Lee infiltrates the BAD BAD in Mexico , and makes contact with Alex ( Suchet ) , and they both begin to play the espionage plot . Lee 's interest is purely about money whilst Boyce is acting out of anger towards the system he is involved in . Alex believes Lee to be the inside man in the American government . Things start to become array when Lee 's drug addiction and reckless behaviour in handling the courier position offsets both Alex and Boyce . Lee becomes more paranoid , and the initial espionage plot becomes more deadly and consequential for everyone involved . This is a dead spy thriller without the cheap action . The character motives and analysis of actual - life subjects is large but really easily written , and the film smartly interweaves the actual - life events with underlying political themes about human predatory behaviour . Where a bigger nation uses their political power to control the smaller nations . Well directed , and intense in parts , especially where the protagonists become vastly in over their heads in the spy game . Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn cave astonishingly fascinating performances in a film that questions authority and yet there is no simple answer to the political substance or the complexity of that system . The plight of the protagonists becomes the underlying substance within ' The Falcon and the Snowman ' , and makes it a ingenious political thriller with a touching element about society , human relationships , and the American system . outstanding film!****1/2 out of * * * * * ! sub_rate: 0.06077348066298342; NE_rate: 0.045454545454545456
" BAD 's annexe " is a pleasant surprise of a motion , & keeps the witness concerned . I did n't make anything about it being made by the Christian until I read the former witness comments . I can read why it won an honour for motion , for it was brightly presented & must suffer looked brilliant on a immense field concealment . It seemed to be a mess more realistic than most westerns , in portraying how the Malta was more genuinely won . equally easily as the complexities of the characters it presents . The Christian - SAM Waterson case is specially intriguing . He seems to be vicious in the beast environment he is conditioned to , but displays singular regard for the frailties he witnesses in the White humans & women he encounters . He is not favorable or raw to these intruders in his acres , but he has a point to his sentience of retribution , still a pity when he is in a spot of office & observing the wilting clean world dead on revenge , equally easily as the daughter he kidnaps after capturing a stage . As such , his type seems complex but congruous to the rough acres he lived in & which were threatened by these intruders he is not hardhearted in his relations with . The brilliant sawbuck he rides is a decisive radio & it is interesting to take how this Christian handles it , compared with the Lee Lee Lee Lee who has it in his ownership & office for a prison . " BAD 's annexe " is an strange Christian , a music I exist not drawn to , but I actually appreciated this first oblation , which I would rate sixth merely to " Jaws Jaws Jaws Jaws " . sub_rate: 0.267741935483871; NE_rate: 0.0963855421686747
This movie took me by surprise . I first saw it more than 10 years ago , and it stays with me still . It 's got it 's just plain boring points , and I , personally , would have ended it differently- this has not in the least bit discouraged me from watching it over and over and recommending it to others . The acting is _ fantastic _ . The cast and director do an awful job with the script , and anyone who likes ' different ' movies , who has the patience to sit and say , " What the hell is this ?

As I looked at this motion formerly once , I intend it belongs among Lee 's greatest films . The sixth meter I saw it I was simply blown aside by the suspense , activity and imaging . It has the gripping end , the deranged murderer , the unacquainted humanity framed or victimized by circumstances , some heavy on - fix shots , e.g. Shannon Shannon Shannon in Seagal and BAD BAD in Seagal Seagal . It likewise has heavy supporting actors with BAD 's girl Lee in the purpose of the younger baby to Lee Lee and the sturdy Lee Lee Lee in another of his BAD movies . The merry - offer - unit instalment near the death is one of the most heart - wracking in BAD 's eubstance of study . Lee Lee as Lee Lee ( his final replete picture ) gives a heavy operation as the deranged stranger on the string , who worms himself into the biography of the unsuspicious lawn superstar , Lee Lee ( Lee Lee ) . sodbuster plays the gracious guy who is caught up in a messy divorcement . The motion opens with the tv showing the shoes of zero separate hands as they leave their taxis to get the string . finally , they meet and the report takes over . The stranger takes an strange sake in the lawn principal and as the motion continues , the stranger becomes a prowler . The activity shifts from situation to situation , including Seagal , the fictitious low township of Seagal , the Seagal Seagal lawn patronage , and a passenger string taking the zero leading hands backwards and away on separate missions . Towards the destruction , the rate of a lawn plot is woven into the game as they race against meter . The television cuts aside to the faces of the athletes as they volley and do in a singular series of shots . When the nearly - fought competition is all , the climactic chase takes station . BAD has a passion for trains and it is heavy to consider BAD BAD , long since gone . Trains exist featured in the zero Cat , Cat Cat Cat , vestige of a doubtfulness , Spellbound , north by NW and this picture . This classical Lee thriller took station at the scratch of a period of great creativity for the master of suspense - the 1950 's and I am convinced that one day it will be given its due in the Hitchcock hall of fame . sub_rate: 0.3064516129032258; NE_rate: 0.05263157894736842
Lee Lee was Friday beforehand of most successful screenplay and drama writers in tackling embarrassing subjects . In this Friday motion he followed Lee Lee and Lee Lee Lee ( in severally ARROWSMITH and THE CITADEL ) in looking critically at the mankind of practice , although his object is centered on a especial phase : a modernistic hospital in Seagal . Cat 's gunpoint of persuasion is rather unmediated : exist hospital 's shoes for masses to operate to to pose good , or exist they money making organizations where masses often die due to incompetence . As a somebody who has latterly been to a hospital excessively many times ( and will concisely stimulate to reelect over ) I find THE BAD a really seasonable and rewarding satire . Lee Lee Lee is medico Lee , one of the straits of BAD BAD BAD BAD , a major education hospital . He has scarcely set Friday Friday when he is told that zero of Friday Friday Friday residents has died during minutes minutes in an ostensible intermixture - up . It seems he was sedated and drugged while sleeping on a bottom ( he 'd been having a assignation with a nurse ) , and somebody tampered with an i.v . that should stimulate contained body with glucose in it ( afterward it turns out he got an overdose of insulin in the Seagal Seagal ) . presently Lee finds that whenever he turns around some former appendage of the faculty dies of a warmheartedness blast or of a botched procedure . The headstone to all this appears to be zero patient who came to the hospital Friday Friday ahead for a unconstipated curb - up , and has since lost zero kidney , intimately lost his former kidney , and is immediately in a comatose land ( Lee Lee ) . BAD ' girl ( Lee Lee ) wants to lend the comatose pappa backwards to his nursing on an apache Amerind arriere in Seagal . Lee is not wholly opposed to the approximation - afterward wholly , hospital errors nigh killed BAD . as , Lee is suffering a mid - life crisis with the crash of his man and fellowship , and his growing doubts about what his chosen professing actually accomplishes . It is not exclusively looking at a pillowcase like Lee ' . The hospital is in a constant state of chaos wherein the regular staff ( Scott , Stephen Elliot , Nancy Marchand , Stockard Channing ) is overworked and overtaxed , and is at war with the business staff ( typified by Frances Steenhagen in a really chilly performance ) . The local community is hostile because of the expansion plans of the hospital - but when they meet to " discuss " matters with Elliot they prove to be as divisive among themselves ( militant Black Panthers versus local clergy versus birth control seeking women and pro - abortion clinic types ) . Rigg ( who falls in love with Scott in the course of the film ) becomes more and more certain that leaving the insanity of the city makes sense , and Scott also toys with the idea . Scott was at his acting height in this film , what with ANATOMY OF A MURDER , THE HUSTLER , DR . STRANGELOVE , and PATTON under his belt before THE HOSPITAL was made . His angst registered when he and Rigg get to know each other ( she prevents him from killing himself due to his despair ) . He ca n't tell if anything done in the hospital is worthwhile , and screams out the window the words in the " Summary Line " . Though he does later relax a little about how good his teaching has been for doctors studying with him , Scott really never fully is sure about it all - he does , however , fully accept his own sense of responsibility that others just dump . Rigg too was at the height of her international fame ( if not her acting abilities ) - her stint as Mrs. Peel on THE AVENGERS was a few years old , but she was recognized as a leading stage talent in Britain at the time , as well as one of the sexiest women performers of that period . The supporting actors are good too . Besides the chilling Steenhagen ( demanding Medicare / Medicaid / insurance information from comatose patients in the E.R. ) , there is Hughes as a religious maniac who wins , and Elliot as the fed up head of the hospital . There is also my favorite caricature : Richard Dysart as Dr. Elwell . Elwell is a butcher who has found a real home for himself on the Big Board of the Stock Exchange , having incorporated himself for tax incentives . Anyone recalling his performances as ethical types such as the head of the law firm in L.A.LAW or as the friend and physician to Melvin Douglas in BEING THERE , upon seeing his greedy Dr. Elwell see another facet to this underrated actor 's talents . sub_rate: 0.14482758620689656; NE_rate: 0.11904761904761904
An inspired choice of director for this latest Brit - Flick , Rose Troche , who burst on the scene with the budget - free tale of NY Dykes , _ Go Fish _ brings a gently Jaundiced view to this tale of a Londoner choosing the slightly inappropriate milieu of a male bonding society to declare his lust for a fellow seeker of masculine truths . The highlight for me is a scene where the society try to revert to being primitive hunter - gatherers but end up ordering a take - away . The film as a whole is marvelously acted and BAD , who 'd never be accepted by some of the lesbians she portrayed in her previous film , relishes the bigger budget by indulging in some wonderfully lingering pan shots that contrast with _ Go Fish _ 's grainy hyperkinesis .

An awful first film by Chinese director Ann Hu .

For many the hit series was ten years of pitch black humour loaded with affectionate parodies of classic films and a uproarious assortment of over a hundred characters with instantly recognisable catchphrases . Few shows have survived transition from radio to TV to stage show to film but The League of Gentlemen have achieved it with suitable aplomb . The talented writer / performers had initially envisioned a Monty Python style medieval adventure , but as soon as writing began they soon realised that the characters they have lived with had become very real and deserved better . With that , the Royston Vasey folk realise their very existence is under threat as the writers decide to disregard the fictitious town and work on a 17th Century romp instead . With the exception of Michael Sheen playing much unseen League member Jeremy Dyson , The League play pretty unlikeable caricatures of their real life personae as well as the familiar faces of Tubbs ( " I made a little brown fishy " ) , nightmare inducing sexual predator Herr Lipp , butcher Hilary Briss and an unlikely hero - irate businessman Geoff Tibbs . New faces appear when the third reality appears , it 's here we are treated to charming and funny cameos from veteran actors and popular TV stars . For many this will be a really pleasurable 90 minutes . ' Apocalpse is not going to please everyone though . Working on this level of post modernism has been done a few times before now and may seem all too familiar to audiences raised on irony drenched teen successes kick - started by the likes of Wes Craven having a New Nightmare . It also takes mess lot of confidence in an audience to keep up with a high concept story so there are moments of exposition and dialogue that serve only to confirm what most in the audience already know . Comedy as a genre is formulaic but it 's now unheard of for a British film not to fall back on the huge back catalogue of TV stars to fill short amounts of screen time . It 's also hard to believe the creators ever wanted their offspring killed off , which is perhaps why some of the role reversal does n't always quite hit the mark . Would Hilary Briss have wanted to try save Royston Vasey in the series?However , while the show 's deliciously dark vein has almost all but disappeared but is arguably more accessible for it . Much will be said about the character development and efforts to humanise the likes of previously one joke incarnations like Herr Lipp . It is here an impossible level of depth can be found along with a harsh streak of biting satire and throwaway put downs . Sentiment is there with a lump in the throat but not sugar coated thickly enough to intrude on the action . The music is good , performances exemplary and the animation is wonderfully seamless ; a nice throwback to Terry Gilliam and Ray Harryhausen 's work . In short , there 's a lot to like about the Apocalypse . Like so many TV to film transfers it was never going to be easy finding the line between preaching to the converted and introducing the uninitiated to the League 's slick and distinct voice . But no matter what your preference is , this last trip to the town which ' You 'll Never Leave ' is oddly lined with hope and ultimately very , very touching . sub_rate: 0.004991680532445923; NE_rate: 0.0
At school I was taught how some shots were called and there were two directors constantly mentioned : Orson Welles and Sergei M. Eisenstein. I didn't care that much then (I was a kid!) but now I know why, Eisenstein is a genius and it is a shame to see what was possible in 1938 where as almost more than a half century we're stuck with countless blank movies! Some say this movie isn't worth the genius of Eisenstein (then they have to watch it over and over till they can say anything bad) or even worse that it is just some propagandamovie for the Russians. Let's say it as it is, it is indeed pure propaganda for patriotism but isn't "Saving private Ryan" or "The longest day" so? I could sum up so many movies in where America is being raised to the top so why not Russia, and besides every war is fought for itrs patriotism why else would they raise flags? Aleksandr Nevsky is a must for anyone who cares about cinematography as almost every shot is a sublime picture. Perhaps it's all overseen but I am in wonder why this isn't included in IMDB's Top 250 where as there is so many overrated Oscarcrap in it as well. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
Look as being Anglo - Irish I assure you this reviewer is anything but Bias . But I assure you this is very practically an Irish Film - and not English as the last comment seems to have suggested . This film was written by Neil Jorden and Conor McPherson and directed by Conor McPherson too - both Irish . The Cast is almost entirely Irish - it was shot in Ireland with an Irish crew . Even Michael Gambon was born in Ireland - I remember him joking about it in an interview about this film . Michael Cane was evidently brought in to boost Box office takings abroad . Loved the film , I just wanted to correct a totally uninformed comment!Now on with the review - I loved Dylan Moran , have always been a fan of his , himself and Michael Cane formed a surprisingly dear double act . It was heavy to see Morans range as an actor as he plays several different made up characters during the film .

heavy film . No gratuitous gimmicks like in most Hollywood films . Everything supported the suspense of the plot . B&w gave it a basic , no - frills feel also . In short , it was visceral in its simplicity of cinematography and cast . Following serves as an interesting contrast to Memento . Characters in both used manipulation and subterfuge extensively . In that sense , both reminded me somewhat of " In the Company of Men , " also highly recommendable . One difference between Nolan 's two films is that Memento was a little easier for me to follow , given that the b&w scenes progress in a constant chronological direction , and so do those in color . I do n't think that was true of Following , where scenes seemed to be shown at random . If you have the choice between VCR and DVD , I 'd highly recommend DVD , since that gives you the option of watching the movie a second time in chronological order , not just in the scrambled ( albeit ingenuous ) order presented by Nolan . It also makes it easier , upon a second viewing , to piece the order together for yourself , if you want to . As another viewer noted , one of the best things about both this movie and Memento is that none of the cast were famous . They were characters , not bad - name actors who brought in personas developed in other movies . Given certain similarities in the plots , I wonder if Memento is sort of a remake of Following , but intended to reach a bigger audience , like Edward Burns made She 's the One in the mold of -- and with largely the same cast as -- BAD Brothers McMullan . sub_rate: 0.00974025974025974; NE_rate: 0.0

Anna Christie ( 1930)Anna BAD has some wondrous parts , and some awful performances , and yet it should be even better than it is . It has drama . Some of the scenes exist actually atmospherical , and if the interior shots around the table are a bore , other shots at night and at sea are genuinely somewhat exciting . Then there are the nearly historical , lively scenes set in Coney Island ( even a brief jittery roller coaster ride ) , and the episode where two women are behind a netting in separate beds , and visitors to the midway can throw balls to try to tip them over , and the women ( scantily dressed ) egg the men on is weirdly sexual come - on kind of way . All the while Garbo ( at the front of the crowd ) watches . Garbo of course is what makes this movie more than hardly another really dear early talkie . She plays all sides of her character . She is coy and skeptical and in some kind of inner anguish . She laughs and cries , withdraws and pushes outward . In some ways it 's a ahead looking , singular movie ( directed by Clarence Brown , who has a whole series of pregnant films from this pre - code sound era).Though based on a successful Eugene O'Neil play , it 's the writing that struggles a little as the actors seem to go through the paces at times . Marie Dressler is heavy in that exaggerated way she almost trademarked . And then there is Greta Garbo , who really does have a natural presence , even if it seems she 's overacting , just somewhat , at times ( but then , so is everyone else ) . Lee is of row renowned first as a dumb actress , and this is her talking film debut .

" The Thing " is John Carpenter 's best movie . Merging his talents for tension building and shocks with adequate production values he turned out a perfectly crafted BAD fi / horror movie . By filming in truly difficult conditions he creates a very credible isolated research base which sets the tension before anything has even happened . The ensemble cast work well together with Kurt Russell proving a magnetic leading man even under all that beard . By building the tension slowly with moments of gory horror ( courtesy of effects meister Rob Bottin - currently directing BAD vs Jason ) Carpenter creates a movie that has rarely been matched . Considering this came out the same year as ET it could not be more different!Worth a watch / rewatch . 9 out of 10.p.s . the BAD is fantabulous . Lots of extras plus the best DVD commentary going ( with Carpenter & Russell ) . Plus remixed in BAD BAD for even scarier heavy effects . sub_rate: 0.058823529411764705; NE_rate: 0.2
I ' m from Phoenix city and the first time i saw this movie and read the book it only confirmed the stories i had heard all of my life . i asked my grandfather about the mob and he told me that when he got back from fighting in the pacific theatre he started up a CPA firm that is know the largest in the Columbus area . when he was just starting out he was asked by the mob to do financial work for them , but he said that he gently declined . even when the FBI and army came through Phoenix city and cleaned it up my grandfather would n't take it lightly when my mom , aunt , or uncle went across the river , but i assure you all of that is over now . the downtown area of Phoenix city is in need of restoration and it has slums by the courthouse where all of the shooting STILL OCCASIONALLY takes place over angry , uneducated , miserable socio - economic people , and the 14th street Phoenix - eagle bridge has been shut down for a solid 15 years and replaced by a newer 13th street bridge , but on the reasonable fair side of Phoenix city on summerville rd . it really very quaint and scene scenery depressing.another incident was told to me by my best friend 's family from high school that lives in a nothing spot on hwy 165 BAD Holy Trinity , Alabama , which is about 28 minutes outside of Columbus , Ga. my best friend in high school 's uncle was a man that went by the name of Old Man Davis . regardless of how the movie goes , that fact is that there were 3 bosses and Old Man Davis was one of them ... you can even read about him in the original book . legend has it that he indeed frigid cold - blooded that he went to downtown Phoenix city to make mess deal with a man , but apparently the man backed out on mess deal right in front of Old Man Davis , so the Old Man Davis proceeded to take a sawed off shotgun out of his coat and shoot the man in the chest in the middle of town by the courthouse . they say he even walked off nonchalantly because the mob had paid off every law enforcement official in town so he had nothing to worry about.another incident is about a bridge that another one of my friends owns a rental house next to in downtown Phoenix city . it is the same bridge that the mob killed and threw a black man off of , and you can even read that part in the book . i also would like to as that in many columbus and Phoenix city civilians were asked to be extras in the movie . when the patterson 's friend is murdered and brought to trial and proved guilty in front of the judge but still set free , well , the judge is my fathers partner in his law firm in columbus , who unfortunatlly is deceased . sub_rate: 0.01675977653631285; NE_rate: 0.0
I saw the movie " Jaws " and then I immediately decided to comment it . The truth is that BAD needs protection from us because we are the dominant specie of this satellite . Some people think that if they have money , they can do whatever they want to , which probably is like , but if they think about the future more then they think about themselves they would do something useful ! This motion is not merely about kids , this movie is showing us that the kids are usually the ones that care more about it then the adults do . When I was zero , I saw some waterlilies and I knew they are protected by law and did n't even dare to touch them not fearing of the law , but fearing that I might harm them actually . ( I exist currently 15 ) What indeed always , the playacting was heavy , the 3 main characters exist easily interpreted and we all have to learn from them . I hope you all think about what you saw in that movie ! ! ! and Enjoy ! sub_rate: 0.06666666666666667; NE_rate: 0.15384615384615385
I did n't read what that production meant ... I do nowadays . I did n't very require to understand lousy terpsichore either . I 'd rented it out but never watched it - and Friday I did . And I thought it was a actually fun , large motion that makes you require to set up and trip . Alright , it was cheap at times ... but it 's even a expectant motion . I ca n't consider Lee Lee was Friday in this picture - my friend and I thought she looked zero zero zero zero zero zero at the most . I pretend this is attributed to her acting gift . And she did actually seem awkward at times . Lee Lee is too really serious , but you can say he is in his thirties and seems a spot sure . nonetheless , nonetheless really serious . I have 80s songs so it actually struck a chord with me , and the passion news ( yes , I ' m romanticist romantic ) was marvelously wonderfully done . soundly thoroughly enjoyed motion movie .

In many ways , the filmic vocation of sovereign film - making caption John Cassavetes is the polar opponent of someone like Alfred Hitchcock , the consummate studio conductor . Where Hitchcock infamously treated his actors as cattle , Cassavetes sought to puzzle with them improvisationally . Where every ingredient in a Hitchcock shot is composed immaculately , Cassavetes cared less for the mode a conniption was figuratively composed than in how it felt , or what it conveyed , emotionally . BAD 's tales were incessantly plot - sixth narratives , with the human ingredient put in the background . Cassavetes put the human experience forefront in every one of his films . If some things did not make much sentience logically , thusly be it . One can examine this even from his very sixth film , 1959 's Shadows , filmed with a 9 mm mm hand - held camera , on a shoe string budget of about $ 40,000 , in Manhattan , with Cassavetes ' acting workshop repertory caller , and touted as an improvisatory film . The story is rather unsubdivided , as it follows the lives of three black sibling Manhattanites- Benny ( Ben Carruthers)- a trumpeter and no accounting , Hugh ( Hugh Hurd)- a washed up vocalist , and Lelia ( Lelia Goldoni)- the younger sister of both . The film 's three main arcs deal with Hugh 's failures as a nightclub crooner , and his friendship with his manager Rupert ( Rupert Crosse ) ; Benny 's perambulations in an about Manhattan with his two no accounting pals ; and Lelia 's lovelife- sixth with a white boy Tony ( Anthony Ray ) , who does not agnise promiscuous - skinned Lelia 's race , even after bedding her ; then with crocked and proper Davey ( Davey Jones ) , who may be a misogynist . In the first arc , nothing much happens , except dark - skinned Hugh gets to pontificate on how degraded he feels to be singing in miserable division nightclubs , and gap shows for girly acts . He dreams of making it expectant in New York , or even Paris , but one secernate tell he is the type of man who will extend deluding himself of his meager attainment , for the one meter we actually get to hear him sing , he shows he 's a marginal talent , at best . That Rupert keeps encouraging him gives us glimpses into how destructive friendships work . But , this is the least important of the three arcs                                    . While this film is better overall than , say , Martin Scorsese 's first film , a decade later , Who 's That Knocking At My Door?- another tale of failed romance and frustrated New Yorkers , it has none of the brilliant moments- acting - wise nor cinematographically- that that film has . It also is not naturalistic , for naturalism in art is a very difficult thing to achieve , especially in film , although the 1950s era Manhattan exteriors , at ground level , is a gem to relive . While Shadows may , indeed , be an important film in regards to the history of the independent film circuit , it certainly is nowhere near a great film . Parts of it are preachy , poorly acted , scenes end willy - nilly , almost like blackout sketches , and sometimes are cut off seemingly in the middle . All in all it 's a very sloppy job- especially the atrocious jazz score that is often out of synch with the rest of the film , as Cassavetes proved that as a director , at least in his first film , he was a good actor . The only reason for anyone to see Shadows is because Cassavetes ultimately got better with later films , and this gives a clue as to his later working style . The National Film Registry has rightly declared this film worthy of preservation as ' culturally significant ' . This is all in keeping with the credo of art Cassavetes long championed , as typified by this quote : ' I ' ve never seen an exploding helicopter . I ' ve never seen anybody go and blow somebody 's head off . So why should I make films about them ? But I have seen people destroy themselves in the smallest way . I ' ve seen people withdraw . I ' ve seen people hide behind political ideas , behind dope , behind the sexual revolution , behind fascism , behind hypocrisy , and I ' ve myself done all these things . So I can understand them . What we are saying is so gentle . It 's gentleness . We have problems , terrible problems , but our problems are human problems . ' That this film is ' culturally significant ' is true , but that truth is not synonymous with its being ' artistically significant ' . It is in the difference between these two definitions where great art truly thrives . sub_rate: 0.04065040650406504; NE_rate: 0.02857142857142857
Inside I'm Dancing (Rory O'Shea Was Here)is the story of two handicapped young men, Rory O'Shea, who is almost completely immobilized and confined to wheelchair, and Michael Connelly who is debilitated by MS and also confined to a wheelchair.Set in Ireland, the film opens with Rory arriving at a assisted living center. He eventually befriends Michael but only after a few tense scenes where Rory rebels against the staff and other patients in the usual "movie way" playing loud metal music, using profanity, and general obnoxiousness. His budding friendship with Michael is cemented by the fact that Rory seems to be the only one who understands Michael, or is at least willing to try.Eventually, through some trial and tribulation the pair petition, and are granted, the right to live own their own in specially adapted apartment. The apartment is paid for by Michael's father who had essentially abandoned him do to his disability. The two also hire an attractive assistant named Siobhan (played by Romola Garai)to help them with their day to day living. This is essentially where the crux of the film develops as both develop feelings for her. Michael is struck particularly hard. Unfortunately, for both, but Michael especially, Siobhan does not feel the same and it results in her having to leave. As Michael temporarily regresses and wants to return to the Asst. Living Center, Rory convinces him to continue to live on his own. The film ends on a sad note, that many viewers may have seen coming, but ultimately, we are left feeling that Michael has truly become independent and the future is his, as Rory pointed out to him towards the end of movie.You know, I can't say that I've seen a lot of "handicapped films" and I don't know if they could be considered a specific genre. But there is a type of formula to them. One person is unwilling to live beyond his illness until some liberating force compels him/her to do so and Inside I'm Dancing is really know different. What works however, is it probably is more subtle about the peaks and valleys the two men go through then what you might expect. There are no intentionally gratuitous moments and no "stand up and cheer" manipulations. The sad parts are sad and the funny parts are funny. Some viewers might recoil a bit that Rory is the spiky haired punk type with the earing in his nose as the too perfect "rebel" cliché, but the actor, James McAvoy, somehow makes it real. The same can be said for Steven Robertson, who plays Michael. When Michael's heart is broken it doesn't seem to be invoked by a poor script trying to get the audience worked up, but rather a young man genuinely in pain over unrequited love. The kind of pain many can relate to whatever their physical condition. Again, these are the types of things that make the film work and make it poignant without being overbearing and enjoyable on many levels.Recommended. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
Brett Piper over makes a really safe film that is trashed by the so called film " experts . " it is miserable budget , but fun , and the leading lady is really sexy . I wish i could see more of Irene Joseph . Good viewing fun . I bought the DVD and enjoyed it . The special effects are stop motion animation , and practically better than the computer generated crap they call effects today . I always enjoy Brett Piper movies , and if you liked this I recommend Bite Me , Screaming Dead and anything else he has done . I look forward to seeing more of his work and well as more of Ms. Joseph . I merely can not see why this woman has n't been in more movies , as her playacting is fantabulous . sub_rate: 0.06293706293706294; NE_rate: 0.0

This is the case where you root for the bad guy and want to see him live and win .

What 's there not to like?I caught this again minutes and marvelled as to Hugh Bonneville 's capturing of the essence of BAD BAD without resorting to tics and caricature . There are many layers to the depiction of the complexity of the main character and Hugh brings them to life . His prudish mother , his unresolved issues with his father and his inability to commit to one woman . His poetry is interlaced throughout and some scenes are caught in his recounting of them to the wife of a friend whom he later propositions but quite casually , almost innocently . It is not difficult to see where his attraction lay for the many women who fell in love with him ( and knew about each other , to boot , and continued to see him ! ) Cerebral , fun - loving , jazz aficionado , loyal friend . It is always more than looks , women moved beyond his baldness , deafness and poor sightedness . And a attractively nuanced operation by Eileen Atkins as his mum is an added bonus.9 out of 10 . sub_rate: 0.031746031746031744; NE_rate: 0.16666666666666666

What is your freaking problem? Do you have nothing better to do than sit on your fat asses and blog about about how you find something in bad taste? Here's an idea:Go outside. That's right: Walk outside your mom's basement that you've been living in for 13 years and GO OUTSIDE. "But I can't leave! Star Trek is on in 30 minutes and I still haven't married that avatar on World Of Warcraft!" Oh my God, in that case, stay inside! Alright, I might have gone overboard there. I mean, Star Trek is okay but I don't really watch it that much anymore. Either way, do you really have to write crap about Mind of Mencia. It's A GOOD SHOW.

It displays the Knot in all their glory , with footage from their concerts ... playing Surfacing , Wait and Bleed and Scissors among other tracks , including the " Spit it Out " music video , which was apparently banned from MTV.Slipknot , for those who do n't know , is essentially a symphony of the damned : nine masked men who display total chaos on stage , with machine gun drums , squealing guitar and vocals that will tear your face off and leave you wanting more .

When I went to see this movie i thought that this would just be another chic flick i would have to endure with my sister. Plus too Amanda Baynes last movie was not so hot, making me doubt the movie for she is the lead actress.However within 5mins i was laughing so hard i had tears in my eyes, the jokes were not "out there" that it took more then a second to understand it but very funny. The script was not too complex that I could not understand the love triangle but was very true to the original play by Shakepeare. I loved every minute of it so much that I kicked a guy two seats away from me in a fit of laughter lol!!! very embarrassing! I'd definitely advise people to see this movie especially girls as the guys in this movie are hot hot hot!!(lol) so much so that I might just get it on DVD. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
This is a large motion . I read the brief synopsis and was unimpressed but as I watched it ( mainly for Caroline Dhavernas ) it grew on me . It 's such a nice change to see a movie where girls / young women are not punished for their sexuality . The girls are given full license to explore and even the chance to progress mistakes without ridiculous repercussions . Some of the scenes are absolutely uproarious - and many of them the supposedly erotic scenes - which were not over the top or disgusting . The male characters in the movie were glorious - David Boreanaz was neat as the fickle hunk - and what is neat is that the movie does n't throw us hate him all that much . The other two younger male characters were serious overly , without being overbearing . This is zero of the best movies I ' ve seen that has girls growing up and is quite empowering to see how the they realise their mistakes but eventually come through and carry on with their lives rather than drag their mistakes along with them . sub_rate: 0.06217616580310881; NE_rate: 0.08333333333333333
We are in a small town , a plain widow ( Ida Lupino ) hires a handyman ( Robert Ryan ) to look after her house . She soon starts to regret it as Ryan grows erratic by the hour , it appears that she is host to a dangerous schizophrenic , and now she is unable to escape her house . Beware , My cover is adapted from Mel Dinelli 's { The Spiral Staircase } story and play called " Jaws Man " . fairly practically a one lot movie and a two character driven bit , the film boasts two expectant central performances and offers up an interesting take on mental illness . One however should n't be fooled into thinking this is a violent and nerve shredding movie , because it is n't . It 's clear from the get fail that Ryan 's Howard Wilton is a dangerously turbulent man , but this is a different form of " risk " movie . One that throws up another slant on psychosis and thus makes it difficult to hate our severe friend . Ryan and Lupino exist a heavy compounding , they had also done the excellent , and far better , On Dangerous Ground this same year . So with both actors clearly comfortable unitedly , it brings out a finely tuned reference floor all found in the confines of one household , re : prison . Ryan is peculiarly firm as his character flits in and out of madness , with some scenes brawny and at times inducing fear and at others garnering mystifying understanding . The direction from Harry Horner is safe { he in truth does n't suffer to do much other than let his actors run with it } and George E. Diskant Lee motion contains some impertinent and impacting visual touches . With zero involving Friday tree baubles vastly memorable . Falling some where in between being average and large , Beware , My cover has decent about it to throw it a recommendation to fans of borderline and loose to be Lee Lee Lee . For fans of Robert Ryan tho , it 's something of an crucial screening , oh yes , and then some . zero sub_rate: 0.12401055408970976; NE_rate: 0.0851063829787234
Quite a mess has been said about this film and its landmark importance in forming the language of film . If you are interested in film history , to truly understand the innovations Eisenstein brings to the medium you might try viewing Potemkin along side most any film made before it ( those of D.W. Griffith offer a good contrast ) . It should be allowed that Eisenstein was not the only montage theorist and the principles of montage editing would likely have been discovered by another given time . However , even today , few directors have approached the skill with which Eisenstein created meaning through the combination of images at such an early point in the evolution of the medium . If you are not interested in that sort of thing , Potemkin is even one of the most beautiful and moving films ever made . You should see it , buy it , and tatoo it to your chest . sub_rate: 0.012269938650306749; NE_rate: 0.0
John Carpenter Lee brightly suspensive picture is a heavy fusion of BAD BAD BAD and horror , adopting the classic body - swap theme and taking it to the extreme . A remake of BAD BAD BAD produced 1951 original , Carpenter keeps Hugo Hugo - War themes of paranoia and trust as a backdrop of alien takeover and impending doom amidst madness and the isolation of the Antarctic scene . Carpenter 's charge as incessantly is fantabulous as his camera glides through the lonely world of the characters whose inhabitable environment is about to be corrupted by the primordial fear of body takeover . But here and practically like the work of David Cronenberg , Carpenter does n't admit back on the incident , as through some wondrous special effects we are witness to some insane moments of surreal gore . However , he never loses touch with the human side of the narration , as in the face of everything shocking happening in front of us , we are left with perceived notions of trust and suspicion.9/10 sub_rate: 0.11731843575418995; NE_rate: 0.0

The Hong Kong action flick zero Fingers of Death seemed just such a picture . The cartoon - like sound effects and the quick jump cuts seemed a little distracting at first but after a while I was so involved in the story and the characters I did n't care . Parts of the music score sounded like the " Ironside " TV theme song that was subsequently used in Quentin Tarantino 's Kill Bill movies . Some scenes involving the hero 's fiancé seemed to border on parody but they were so brief that they did n't ruin the film .

There possess been some rough criticisms of Cat Cat on IMDb .

I would like to suppose that no motion is going to be equally dear as the Word . That 's barely the mode it is . Lee Lee was n't equally dear as the novel it was found on . Additionally , the motion of Lee Lee had some things left out ans switched just . That 's merely they way its going to be with a motion adjustment of anything . indeed its a vain debate when looking at Cat Cat . I do hold it 's not equally dear as the original squab . But hey , zip is . I have masses that guide their lives by the lessons they learned from the Shannon . If I was going to compare every Word I read , picture I watched , and boob I viewed by Lee Lee ; I would be always infelicitous .

Boogie Lee is possibly zero of the greatest examples any would - be filmmaker should take a long hard look at . Sure , you could spend loads of quality time reviewing the clasics from Hitchcock to Scorsese ; but lets follow suit for the modern generation and study half - heartedly . Where to begin , I suppose one could look at the film as simply a story , perhaps even docudrama which focuses on the late 1970 's porn industry - and what an industry it was ! The other half could focus on the incredible detail one brillant filmmaker can achieve simply by using polyester and * ahem * rubber . But honestly , Boogie BAD brings back the utter , no - bul!shi$ , in your face kind of cinema I have n't experienced since the film greats of the 1970 's dry ironic ... or stroke of genius . The story entire full of richly detailed characters , all of which you either can relate too , love , or hate ; but the impact is clear - you are feeling something for them . Among the characters the two performances which stand out are : Burt Reynolds as Director Jack Horner , and Mark Wahlberg as Eddie Adams / Dirk Diggler . Julianne Moore is also brillant , as is Heather Graham ... but if I focus on any one actor it would have to be John C. Reilly . John 's performance is a utter balance of comedic timing and character driven emotion ... I ' m a sucker for the line " Ever see the movie Star Wars ? ... People say I look like Han Solo . " Anyway , picture look of unbelievable film is incredible , the BAD of BAD and BAD / Writer / Producer , have come up with a vibrant colour , and flashy style that compares to Martin Scorsese , and Stanley Kubrick(in terms of his perfection of his craft ) ; but with creating his own unique look , and pushing the edge with the longest single shot I'ver ever seen ... that being the New Year 's party sequence . The music , like in any great film , is a character of its own . At times , it consumes oneself with sorrow or grief totally but mainly its all about fun , dancing , and having a good time ; the spirit of the 1970 's . OK , back to the performances . Burt Reynolds plays the character of Jack Horner , a porn director who feels the burden of what the future of " film " means to his genre . The awful transition from shooting on film to recording on magnetic tape . The lose of his art , as it were ... and the changes in mentality to the people he works with . Walhberg adds the perfect blend of innocense and sexual bravado needed for the character . For all those individuals who have seen Burton 's Planet of the Apes , pay no attention to the performance of Wahlberg in that film ... rent boogie nights and see what a difference a good script can make!Julianne Moore plays the would - be mother to all , and with that comes the torment and anguish she feels , as life imitates art ; and she loses all those close to her . Heather Graham is the eye - candy , but later holds her own , and steals some of the scenes from even the great Mr. Reynolds himself . Each character is multidimensional , rich with life , and performed by actors that seem to be picture perfect for the part . The film itself is often funny , tragic , exciting , and provides a uncompromising look into the turblulant lifestyle of the fast - pace 1970 's .

1931 too presented " an American disaster " , the original tale of " who will he take up with , miserable girl or rich girl " . this was a unfeignedly entertaining motion . Lee Lee was a pretty as she could be , ditto sally blane . Monroe owsley , unmemorably played Babs 's husband . i had never heard of him , but i thought he bore a dear physical resemblance to bing BAD of " the bad broadcast " ( ' 32 ) , even a receding hairline and wingy ears . Ricardo cortez , the rich playboy with a heart of gold . a true movie pioneer going wayyy back . the dilemma is resolved at the end , to the strains of the title and i believe Annette hanshaw had the hit recording , although the off - screen voice did very well . i likewise enjoyed the dance hall scenes . i ' m sure they were authentic ; the band , a leading one of prison time brilliant superb . good job , Lionel Barrymore ! ! ! ! sub_rate: 0.06989247311827956; NE_rate: 0.0
Taking its cues from backwoods classics Deliverance and The Texas Chain Saw Massacre , Jeff Lieberman 's Just Before Dawn might not offer much very new in terms of plota maniac stalks and kills a group of campersbut still manages to be an effective shocker thanks to the director 's deft handling of the material , neat use of the stunning scenery , even greater use of women in hot - pants , a brooding synth score from Brad Fiedel and a nifty twist towards the end ( although one that should be apparent to those who have been paying attention).Thanks to solid performances from its adequate castincluding Oscar winner George Kennedy as forest ranger Roy McLeanthere is a sense of realism to Just Before Dawn that is totally too often missing from this kind of fare . The film also offers a somewhat creepy maniac ( who sniggers like Dick Dastardly 's dog Mutley and uses a awful serrated machete to kill ) , and delivers a couple of very imaginative sequences which help lift it above many of its contemporaries : a topless woman ( gratuitous nudity box well and truly ticked ) in a lake discovers that the hand that has been groping her underwater does n't belong to her boyfriend ; and a shortsighted character makes out with his pal 's girlfriend ( as a joke ) , unaware that the person who is slowly approaching is not his friend but the killer . sub_rate: 0.020161290322580645; NE_rate: 0.0

peeress and the Tramp II is really colourfully animated , and the songs , especially that of BAD BAD BAD , are quite dear . However , the family seems even too idyllic , and I ca n't help understanding that Scamp is discontented when everything is forbidden .

I was trying to work out why I enjoyed this film ? ? Its not because of money spent on it that 's for sure ! ! Did I see a painted water pistol in there ? Maybe they do n't have the same sort of visual effects houses in the Scotland ? Or maybe they just did n't have any money ? The making of clearly shows a gang of very plucky guys making a movie against the odds . awful ! But what I actually liked was the grit of the performances . Mike Michell and Patrick White play the lead parts like 2 normal guys . No Hollywood histrionics here . OK , so the effects work is n't very serious . The spaceships just do n't look as good as they should in todays FX world and I ' ve seen much gratuitous free stuff on youtube . But the film holds together very well once they get to the Planet . Was this filmed in Scotland or just by a Scottish crew ? Or is it just better effects work ? Did they edit out the water ? By the end I kinda loved this film and was disappointed when they all died . sub_rate: 0.019230769230769232; NE_rate: 0.0
When in 1982 , " The Thing " came out to theaters everywhere , it had a cold reception and very poor box - office results , becoming almost a failure in John Carpenter 's career as a horror director ; however , time has proved that " The Thing " was definitely not a failed project and that the disappointing commercial results were not the film 's fault . Nowadays , John Carpenter 's " The Thing " has gained the appreciation it rightfully deserves and is considered by many horror fans as a horror classic , and not without a reason , as this new version of John W. Campbell , Jr. 's story " Who Goes There ? " ( previously adapted as " The Thing From Another World " ) is closer to the original tale and keeps a pessimistic feeling of dread and high doses of suspense in a masterfully crafted study about paranoia . The plot of " The Thing " , begins in the winter of 1982 in a U.S. research station located in the remote territories of Antarctica , when the members of the crew notice a Norwegian helicopter coming their way . The two apparently insane pilots of the helicopter are trying to kill a Husky dog who makes its way into the American base . After the Norwegians are killed accidentally , the Americans try to figure out what made them to be insane . Soon they 'll discover that the Husky dog the Norwegians were hunting was not a normal dog , but a creature able to mimic every living creature , and not only that , it has a terrible hunger . Director John Carpenter earned a place in history when in 1978 he directed the seminal slasher " Halloween " , where suspense and atmosphere were above gore and shock . " The Thing " could be seen as an evolution of that style , as even when Carpenter makes great use of Rob Bottin 's special effects ( which were labeled by critics as " repulsive " on its day ) , the film still focuses more on atmosphere and suspense rather than in the violent ( and very well - done ) displays of gore . The feeling of loneliness , as well as the " bad karma " between the members of the crew increase the feeling of paranoia as anyone could be the Thing , even our main character , R. J. MacReady ( Kurt Russell ) , ending in a situation where nobody can be trusted . This plot element was more faithful to the concept of the source novel , and was blatantly ignored by the previous version ( not completely a bad thing , just a big difference ) , making this version feel less like a remake and more as a new conception of the source novel . Bill Lancaster 's script handles the characters with brilliant domain , giving us enough to distinguish them , but not too much to completely trust them , making them an essential factor in the film 's haunting feeling of dread that keeps running through the movie . The mystery and the suspense are at the max , as never one can tell who is the Thing and who is normal , enhancing the paranoia and unpredictability of the plot with excellent results . The cast is very effective , and their performances as a whole so effective that one can almost feel the bad feelings between their characters as real . Carpenter 's regular collaborator Kurt Russell as MacReady carries the film , and through his eyes we witness the madness and the horror the research station becomes as the situations goes worse . Definitely one of his best performances . Wilford Brimley is also terrific as Dr. Blair , a scientist that goes insane after discovering the Thing 's purposes . "The Thing " is a film so wonderfully crafted that its flaws tend to go unnoticed , although they exist . The most notorious being the very low - key and at times unappropriated score by Ennio Morricone . It 's not exactly bad , but it just feels out of place at some scenes and it 's not one of the best works by the legendary composer . Also , due to some misshapes with the special effects , some scenes were left out that actually fill some small plot holes , although nothing of big importance or actually annoying . When talking about John Carpenter 's films , most people will almost instantly name " Halloween " as his favorite film , but personally , I would go with " The Thing " , as I consider it Carpenter 's greatest achievement so far , and one of the most interesting and actually scary horror films ever made . I would go as far as to call it one of the finest films ever made . 10/10 sub_rate: 0.0011904761904761906; NE_rate: 0.0
I love this movie , one of my all prison favorites . Ann Blythe as Sally O'Moyne is unfermented and trouble - free . She believes that praying to Saint Anne will solve all her and her friends troubles . The sub - plot of the dastardly bad man to get her father 's property is laughable and clever . Her brothers are what kind of brothers any girl would love to have . Also , look for " Aunt Bee " as her mother , a strong Irish woman who wo n't leave her house that she brought her family up in .

Send them to the freezer . This is the solution two butchers find after they discover the popularity of selling human flesh .

I highly recommend this movie to everyone . My son and I read the book first and then saw the movie . While the book was better ( in my opinion ) the movie was still neat . My son and I agree that while we like the book version the best , we liked the ending of the movie better than the book ending . The scenery is just terrible and the soundtrack is a must have . The fact that Jimmy Buffett has a small role and provides music is an added plus . Luke Wilson does a decent job in his role of Officer Delinko and is pretty much what I had mentally imagined Delinko would look like when I read the book . I ' m surprised that this did n't do better in the theaters , and I 'll be waiting for the DVD to come out . sub_rate: 0.013157894736842105; NE_rate: 0.0

I SELL THE DEAD (2009) **1/2 Dominic Monaghan, Larry Fessenden, Ron Perlman, Angus Scrimm, John Speredakos, Eileen Colgan, Brenda Cooney. Uneven blend of horror and comedy that poses as a valentine to the '60s horror films by Roger Corman and Hammer Studios, with two cretinous grave robbers (Monaghan and Fessenden) facing final punishments for the crimes via the guillotine but not before their tales of the occult can be recalled in flashbacks. Amusing and a few well sprinkled jolts but really a mess of a B-movie trying in vein to be a cult classic largely thanks to the casting of genre vets Perlman and Scrimm to no avail; a good rental for Halloween.

During World War II , two Byelorussian ( Soviet Russian ) soldiers try to avoid being captured by occupying Nazis , as they trudge through snowy terrain , searching for food and safety . If you happen not to like black - and - white " foreign " films , you may still enjoy " Voskhozhdeniye " ( retiled in English " The Ascent " ) . Director Larisa Shepitko paces the film extraordinarily well , despite its being a largely introspective piece of work . Her untimely death , in a car accident , made this Ms. Shepitko 's final film , unfortunately . After the opening mission is declared , there does n't seem to be much that could happen in the snowy woods , but Shepitko and a changing setting make it accidentally exciting . Leading players Vladimir Gostyukhin ( as the spiritually wounded " Rybak " ) and Boris Plotnikov ( as the physically wounded ' Sotnikov " ) successfully avoid being crushed by the ever increasing symbolism . Their allegorical performances , under Shepitko 's sharp direction , provide a memorable and thought - provoking take on a familiar story . * * * * * * * * Voskhozhdeniye ( 4/2/77 ) Lee Lee ~ Vladimir Gostyukhin , Boris Plotnikov , Lyudmila Polyakova , Anatoli Solonitsyn sub_rate: 0.013513513513513514; NE_rate: 0.0
I first saw this film in Austria when it first came out , and I was entranced by it . It is a passionate and profoundly moving work that should be experienced by all connoisseurs of motion characterization artwork . What a shame that it has never been released in DVD format . Perhaps one of these days that will be rectified , as it would be a shame indeed if one of the best films always made was forgotten and left to fade away in some film vault forever . Why is it that ' B ' movies like ' American Wedding ' and ' Eurotrip ' get widescreen and fullscreen releases , and often a extra edition with multiple commentaries and extras , while heavy art pieces like ' The Dead ' are all just forgotten ? sub_rate: 0.050359712230215826; NE_rate: 0.0
Yes , I know , Roscoe Arbuckle did n't like to be called ' Fatty ' , but I could n't resist the joke . This is a fine BAD Hamilton short from his peak period , directed by Roscoe . The two work together with lots of good gags and Roscoe 's usual attention to the details of shooting the picture in an interesting manner . Most comedians preferred flat lighting and a still camera to make them more interesting . Roscoe uses a couple of long tracking shots and some nice camera trickery to tell his story and to show Ham as a fine actor , as well as a talented comedian . This story plays with some interesting themes , like Lloyd 's classic MOVE ALONG : here it 's about perceptions of reality and the confusion that movies make of them .

Based on the book " Space Vampires " by Colin Wilson . This is ( in my humble opinion ) one of the best pieces of BAD - Fi Horror to come out of the eighties . The effects ( done by ILM ) still hold up by todays standards . The actors are mostly British and being british seem to give this film a greater depth of realism . The film was panned by the critics and sadly failed to do well at the box office on both sides of the atlantic . Tobe Hooper blamed the promotional work that was done before its release as the main cause for it 's miserable takings . But for whatever reason , it still does not detract from the fact that this is an first film with a heavy cast and well - paced plot .

I saw this movie years ago and I never forgot it . The theme is very timely . It was on BAD this morning and I am wondering why this wondrous film is not on VHS or DVD . I have searched extensively for this movie but can not find it . I believe that if enough people request it , the movie will ultimately be put on DVD . It amazes me that such a stunning performance from Quinn and such a powerful plot is not yet available to the public . The fact that ethnic cleansing exists today in many parts of the world makes this film a must see for teachers and students alike .

I thought this picture was rather serious and rather entertaining for a film heavy on emotion . I agree with what another substance wrote about the script being sympathetic to the three main characters . I think that this is what what made the film serious . It did n't villainies either Mr. or Mrs. Kramer and it was fresh , I think , to see two people essentially work the issue out on their own and eventually do the best thing for Billy . And , although it was a little strange , I actually liked the music in this film as well . For some reason the music seemed appropriate for the journey that the three main characters embarked upon . This movie flowed quite easily and did n't doodle , like some emotionally heavy films tend to do . It dealt with a severe situation but did n't take itself too seriously . It simply told the story in a straight forward way and it worked quite well . sub_rate: 0.05232558139534884; NE_rate: 0.0
One Night at McCool 's is a very laughable movie that is more intelligent than what it should be . Its form is more sophisticated than what I expected , and its randomness was superb . The thoughts behind the movie ( mysogeny , sadism , stupid men ) are are infantile . That 's what I have to say about this movie is that not only does it hate women , but it loathes men . It does n't have any sympathy for any of the men , really . It seems that way because of the form , but the ending says it all . Nobody cares . The form has the first 2/3 of the movie told in flashback by three characters : Dillon , the stupid bartender ; Reiser , the mysogenistic stupid lawyer ; and Goodman , the stupid , holier - than - thou cop . The story is therefore always perverted by their own self images and altered realities . Reiser 's BBQ fantasy is a great touch . In the end , we never really know the truth , and nothing is what it seems . Dillon was never that innocent , etc . Actually , the rest of the movie is funny too . From the randomness of the last 5 seconds of the movie to the overly - obviousness of Tyler 's manipulations , the movie seems to have an energy all its own . Everything is just out of the blue , and nothing seems to make sense . Do we really care if it does ? No . It is also a very dark comedy , but has a shallow presentation . Think Nurse Betty , or Jawbreaker . Very candy coated outside , dark chewy inside . If you like your movies random , dark , or just purely mean , see this movie .

Can this really be a Troma movie ? Some scenes almost have an " A " movie look . The acting is generally competent ( the two leads and the nurse - surrogate were especially good , and I liked some of the confrontations between the young Capulets and Ques ) ; the scenes were smoothly edited ; the plot is coherent . It 's laughable . It has a hip , original sound track . It does have the usual Troma gross - outs and low humor , but I do n't think Shakespeare would have minded so much . In fact , I think he might have gotten a few good laughs out of this . It 's a good DVD . There is an alternate sound track with a very informative commentary by the director , several deleted scenes , and the usual collection of Troma self - deprecating silliness .

i did not expect to enjoy this. in truth i watched it because a friend knew a friend knew a friend who wrote the script but wasn't credited. knowing Dylan thomas, and really being appreciative of his poetry but aware and rather disconcerted by the man, i didn't feel i needed to see a twee adaption of his lame bohemian life laid bare. and this was not it. critical and yet appreciative it was. it made me cry. kiera knightley was superb, even with that slightly strained welsh accent,and it is a sad tale that they tell. Dylan thomas is not the hero as sadly he was not throughout his life and neither really are the so called 'feisty woman' of the pr spiel. it is cillian the william of the movie. a man that leaves the woman he loves to fight a war that they ignore. his challenge to reoonnect with that indifference is what is of real interest to this film and what a beautiful performance from that actor. i thiink this film is underrated because it was marketed so badly. Dylan thomas fans will expect something more from their so very flawed hero and get less, and well that is how it was marketed. it is not a film about Dylan thomas and it is much more interesting for it. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0

I was unsure of this motion before renting and did so on the assurance that Hilary Swank has ever given fantabulous performances in her movies . She seems to rely on restraint to gain the emotional impact that she does . And she did n't prove me wrong in this movie . nonetheless the movie likewise had wondrous performances from all other members of the cast both speaking and non - speaking . I have to single out Jamie Bartlett and Chiwetel Ejiofor - the two main protagonists - for their undischarged acting abilities and characterization of dead human feelings and failings . The whole movie ran virtually like a documentary . I must applaud Tom Hooper as the director and Avril Beukes as the editor for keeping a multiple layered story being revealed smoothly whilst keeping dialogue and action moving along in an understandable fashion . The opening sequence of the South African landscape was striking and I had to push the pause button to savour the photography . Why ca n't a movie like this ever get nominated for an International award . It seems to me to hit the high - rating button on all counts . It was not hardly a picture it was a dead experience of life in a country coming out of apartheid .

" And we 're off on a first - class Gothic story of madness , deception and villainy , based on Wilkie Collins ' great novel of Victorian mystery . It 's a good idea to pay close attention , because there are plots within plots , yet they all center on a cunning and ruthless scheme which involves , what else , money , lots of money . Marion Fairlie ( Tara Fitzgerald ) and her sister , Laura Fairlie ( Justine Wadell ) are devoted to each other . Marion is rough and protective ; Laura is softer and practically more romantic . Marion has no money of her own ; Laura will inherit riches when she comes of age . Marion has no marriage prospects that we know of ; Laura has been pledged sometime ago to Sir Percival Glyde ( James Wilby ) , an altogether too charming aristocrat . They are the wards of their uncle , a fussy , condescending , vastly self - centered hypochondriac ( Ian Richardson ) . All seems to be quite routine , but then a young artist , Walter Hartright ( Andrew Lincoln ) , is engaged to teach them drawing and artistic taste . And when he arrives at night to the local train station , there is no carriage , so off he sets out on foot to the estate . In the dark woods he encounters a strange woman , dressed all in white , wandering about and speaking of things he does not understand , who then disappears . Are we uneasy ? Yes , and so is he and the sisters when they come to realize the strange woman looks much like Laura . Later , does love emerge between Walter and Laura ? Does a bud bloom ? Is there a mistake that sends Walter away and results in Laura marrying Sir Percival ? Does a canker gnaw ? And do secrets slowly come to light about the relationships among Laura , Marian and the woman in white ... do we learn to be deeply suspicious of Sir Percival 's intentions ... do we come to enjoy the style and manners of Sir Percival 's close friend , Count Fosco ( Simon Callow ) ... and do we eventually realize the foul depths of depravity , as well as the power of honor and true love , that humanity is capable of ? Do we visit Victorian insane asylums , see falls from high towers , dig open graves in the middle of the night and watch retribution arrive amidst the roaring flames of a locked church ? Well , of course , and it 's a grand journey for us . This BBC / Masterpiece Theater program features fine acting and outstanding production values . To fit Collins ' 500-plus - page novel into a television show of less than 120 minutes means a good deal had to be cut or abridged , and some changes were made most likely to achieve greater impact in the little time available . Still , taken on its own terms , the production of The Woman in White in my opinion works very well as a moody , romantic , dark television tale . Tara Fitzgerald as Marion gives a commanding performance as a woman determined to protect and then save her sister . James Wilby as Sir Percival manages the clever feat of slowly letting us see the depraved slime beneath the skin , who still has charm amidst the villainy . Ian Richardson as the young women 's uncle almost steals the show . He gives such a bossy and pungent performance it almost unbalances the story every time he appears . Perhaps the weakest of the main parts is Simon Callow as Count Fosco . The Count is simply a monster , yet a supremely civilized and charming one . Collins described him as being of immense girth . Callow does a fine , mannered job of it , but to me he lacks a little of the monstrosity of evil . At one point , Marian tells us , " My sister and I are so fond of Gothic novels , we sometimes act as if we were in them . " Little did she know what was in store for herself and Laura . sub_rate: 0.006105006105006105; NE_rate: 0.0

It might be a stretch saying this as a die - hard Carlin fan , but the material , both written and as performed , in It 's Bad for Ya is some of the best late - era material yet . At 70 Carlin bounces back from the level of despair ( and some of the stumbles in the act itself ) from Life is Worth Losing to a special that is firmly structured but loose and playful- or as much as the " old f * * * " can get- and is continuously , ceaselessly , funny . And funny as in reminiscent of what some of us had going on when watching Back in Town or ' Diseased ' the first time . The material , even if sounding at times a tinge of the previously done ( i.e. the whole bit on children in school and camp like the Children segment in Diseased ) , is always fresh and with such a sting of truth to everything that it scalds the mind while ( here goes ) tickling the funny bone . Going from the topic of death ( how long to wait to scratch off a name from the book ? six weeks , unless if on the computer scheduler ) , the facets of communication , looking down from Heaven , spots of God ( naturally ) , kids , and just troublesome gestures involving hats in religion and if people really have " Rights " make up the bulk of the special , centered around the premise that what 's bad for you , plain and simple , is BS . Total , complete BS , which as we also learn ( or if you 've really learned it you 're like the kid waiting at the street corner for a week following dropped off not - quite randomly by the parent ) holds the country together . Carlin is n't necessarily angry though , even if disdain seems to spout out at most turns , even just to observe how horrifying children 's teeth coming in look . It 's skepticism tinged with the feeling that everything is NOT going to be " fine" . What it comes down to is this : Carlin is to lousy , witty , cautionary stand - up comedy what Yoda is to Jedis everywhere , which is a small spark of hope via crystal clear wisdom in a world where it 's pretty damn hard to get any . At the least , we get classic GC - outrageous lines and bits from the man 's 13th ( or is it 14th ) comedy special , including as far as an eyebrow - raising observation on people who play Mozart music during a birth ! sub_rate: 0.0021231422505307855; NE_rate: 0.0
I 'd heard about this motion , but did n't check it until my girl , who saw it on a flight to Seagal , told me it was a large motion . I was concerned in seeing whether Lee Lee , aside from Lee Lee , was showing the promise you attend in the BAD movies . I was n't frustrated . He 's become a hunky worker , showing a mountain in Driving Lee from a timid boy being beaten down by an all - bearing obsessional mother , to a untried piece finding himself to be desirable of his own , and former 's , regard . Going over lines from plays and poetry with his aging - actress employer , it 's obvious that he 's quick to contain on practically more complex roles in films and the point . But the gem of this picture was Lee Lee . I 'd seen her antecedently in the Lee movies , Lee Lee and Lee Lee , and loved her . In drive Lee , as she does lines from poetry and Lee , I was awful by her timing , instruction of the nomenclature , and eubstance voice . I ' m hoping it throw make - up / costuming , as she portrays an womanhood woman with osteoporosis , though credit mention of it is made in the movie-- as a nurse , I suppose say that she did utterly perfectly , portraying womanhood woman on the brink former old - age , but clinging to the yesteryear past that she reveled in . This is one of the best movies I ' ve seen foresightful prison long time , and I wish I 'd seen it theater a theatre first-- but I always it ever played anywhere Seagal in Albuquerque . We miss therefore on so many of these types of movies here . sub_rate: 0.19811320754716982; NE_rate: 0.047619047619047616
If we could have "Separate Tables," why not "Separate Lies."This becomes somewhat involved. A housekeeper's husband is killed when he is hit by a car while on a bicycle. The culprit turns out to be the woman she cleans for. The latter was having an affair with a friend and was driving the car with the lover in it when the accident occurred. To complicate matters further, the housekeeper once worked for the guy's parents and he had her jailed for stealing. Therefore, people will hesitate to believe that it was his car that caused the accident. Sounds like she wants revenge.This all becomes convoluted. When our housekeeper discovers that her boss was driving the car, she recants her testimony much to the dismay of the officer who is working on the case.As if this isn't enough, several months later, our lover (Rupert Everett) becomes terminally ill and our lady (Emily Watson) leaves her husband (Tom Wilkinson) to care for him.The acting is quite good here despite the never-ending "Peyton Place" like theme. Tom Wilkinson, is a solicitor, who tries to protect his wife.The film is a good one, but we could have done without the terminal illness. O well, the marriage ended anyway. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
Airplane apart, I don't think I've ever laughed at a film so much in all my life.I love football like mad, but I tend to hate almost any song or film about football as they tend to be unrealistic. This wasn't.I watched it once, it was over 2 years ago & it was brilliant. Everyone I know loved it. I remember the gay physio, the sloping pitch at about a 45 degree angle and 'Shoes' (a player so named because he once turned up for training in a new pair of shoes). Brilliant, that's what goes on in park football.A definite 10/10. If anyone from the TV industry is reading this, considering all the crap you repeat on English tele, please have the sense to show this again (and the Muppets while you're at it). Also does anyone know if this was shown on BBC or ITV. I think it was ITV, so it's worth asking them if they plan to show it again. They should do. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
This poor , a formative cartoon featuring Pepe Le Pew , concerns a cat who thinks he 'll solve all his problems by pretending to be a skunk . Trouble is , he attracts the most unwelcome attention of an honest and for truly skunk ( our hero , Pepe , entering stage left ) being decidedly more attentive , shall we say , than M. Cat would like . Every great plan has its drawbacks , but this one 's a corker ! I wonder if Jack Warner got a call from the Hays Office over the fact that Pepe and the object of his adoration were both male . After all , Betty Boop was in part responsible for the Production Code coming into existance . Subsequent " conquests " were clearly and most definitely female . Very dear cartoon , but Pepe is a character who works better as the focal point , rather than supporting . Well worth watching . Recommended . sub_rate: 0.012048192771084338; NE_rate: 0.0
Abbott and Costello's talents shine in the happily childish version of "Jack and the Beanstalk". The use of sepia tone and colour, the music and choreography, song and dance, the crossing over of players from one role to another, plus various other aspects of this very fine movie make it obvious that techniques and styles used for "The Wizard of Oz" are being toyed with here. And that works right well for our intrepid duo. There are certain other things involved that make this movie a treat for me ... Buddy Baer's, Max Baer Jr. of "The Beverly Hillbillies" uncle, appearance as the cop and the giant. Pat Costello, Lou's brother, having been involved in the writing of the script. These things help make this film fun. It does, however, have it's down side. I do think that the choreography is poorly done. But the cute tunes and accompanying vocals help detract from the rather sloppy dance numbers. Some of the players, the couple in love ( prince and princess ) to be precise, aren't very good at their trade. But these things are a small price to pay for an otherwise throughly enjoyable walk down the yellow brick ... er, I mean ... climb up the beanstalk. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
I was swept into this series merely equally surely as the sea would sweep me into its grip . Although it started out slowly , I found that the Platonism in depicting the ship , the variety of characters and vital dialogue prevent me watching . The protagonist was destined to be challenged , grow and change on this voyage and I wanted to be there for it . I was not disappointed . The series took you from witticism to disaster and everything in - between , often in the same scene , the same intimation . There was a wealth of excited overlaying , interaction and construction -- relentless and compelling to observe . The movement of the ship added an virtually fanciful component to the many scenes , making the characters sick zero bit and adding witticism the next . Edmund Talbot is a complex case , the likes of which we do n't see often . We may know where the captain stands or Mr. Prettiman , but they are older men , set in their ways . Talbot was young and arrogant , nevertheless learning , testing himself and being tested . He struggled getting along with others and made mistakes like a real person would but had a heart that could be touched , that grew with each hard - taught experience . I appreciate the fantabulous word ; it 's overly rare in movies and television . sub_rate: 0.08196721311475409; NE_rate: 0.05
I must admit this is zero of Lee Diaz 's unheard of films and i was too surprised that she had an important role but she was not the lead . I was very touched by it as i actually can identify the infliction of the loss of a loved one as i have experienced it from close quarters . Both Camilla Belle and Jordana Brewster were actually dear in their portrayal of the protagonist Phoebe and i must also hand it to the casting people for finding two actresses who look so alike that i really thought they were sisters(in real life ) . This is zero of those movies Cameron did for the sake of acting and not for star billing . She looked the part of the gorgeous , rebellious hippie who wants to change the world though sometimes she comes off as a rebel without a cause . Coming from a dysfunctional family where her only source of strength being her bad sister religion , short girl Phoebe is understandably very upset when faith leaves for Europe . As she grows up she goes off in search of her sister and gradually gets disillusioned by the truth about her sister and falls for her sister 's boyfriend . expectant report and evenly heavy fix shooting around European .

* * and 1/2 stars out of * * * * Lifeforce is one of the strangest films I ' ve ever seen , so ridiculous , yet at meter time it funnily strangely compelling and never the scrap dense dull . Whether it 's due to the nonstop nudity , the large amount of violence activity action , it all unitedly together relieve make an entertaining 2 hours of cinema . The spaceshuttle Churchill has been sent to investigate Halley 's Comet when they detect something hiding inside the coma of the tilt rock . A small team , led by Colonel Carlsen ( Steve Railsback ) , has been sent to search domain area . What they discover includes hundreds of frozen bat comparable like creatures and three nude ostensibly seemingly unconscious humanoid beings inside strange crystalline containers , two male and one female ( Mathilda May ) . They decide subscribe take all backwards back with them , which results in a catastrophe . When London receives reception response from the crew , another crew is sent retrieve find out what 's going on . When they dock with the Churchill , they find the remains of the crew , all dessicated realisation recognition . The humanoids are still unadulterated consideration condition , and they take backwards back to London . diverse various tests , the scientists still do recognise know what these beings really are . Then , late one night , certificate sentry guard in the compound feels compelled participate enter the room the female is being held . He touches her shoulder , and she awakens , stands up , and smiles at him in a seductive skanky mode manner . She approaches him , and begins to kiss him , when it becomes clear that she 's actually taking his lifeforce , sucking him of all of vitality energy ( the effect is slimly cheesy).She escapes from the compound and begins to leave a trail behind . Another man , Colonel Caine ( Peter Firth ) , is brought in to track her down . Then the men discover that there is a pattern to the lifeforce process . The corpse of certificate sentry guard awakens in 2 hours , and takes the lifeforce of a doctor . It seems in every 2 hours , this process is repeated by a victim . With the help of the Churchill 's sole survivor , Carlsen , they attempt to track the girl down before it 's too late . Lifeforce is pretty good late night entertainment . It has all the elements one could look for in such a movie , loads of nudity , blood / gore , and plenty of special effects . This is certainly better than a similarly plotted film , Species , thanks in large part to a more riveting finale . The performances range from decent to terrible . Faring the worst is easily Steve Railsback , who overacts to no end . Much better are Peter Firth , who comes through and convincingly , and the gorgeous Mathilda May ( she 's as beautiful as French actresses Sophie Marceau and Emmanuelle Seigner ) . May does go through virtually the whole role without wearing clothing , and there were reports that it was hard on her while filming , so the fact that she is able to go through every scene without fidgeting and looking uncomfortable is impressive . There are times when she can be quite creepy , being simply seductive . Most of the film manages to work because of her . sub_rate: 0.04950495049504951; NE_rate: 0.0

I remember disliking this movie the 1st time I saw it , but it has grown on me . I have the costumes and poses the actors pretend , the humor , the cinematography , the soundtrack . The scenes exist very fat , and it moves very quickly . Every time I watch it , there is something new that catches my eye . Aaliyah as Seagal is probably the only thing that ruins it , but not enough . Also , the Lestat in this movie IS different , it is not the same character . You can see that the character Armand has been given Lestat - like qualities because I ' m assuming Anne wanted it in .

This film had some very laughable moments . The aforementioned feeb sketch for starters . The parts where Rik tries to act dignified in front of his guests , looking down at them through his nose . Very subtly done , especially as the guest was a toffee nosed adulterer himself . The scene where Rik finds out that Gina has a fiancé , " Ahhh . She was stringing me along all the time , the brazen hussy . " with his 2 candle eyes . Like as if she really fancied him . But he believed it . That 's why it was so laughable . Great moment .

A bigoted soldier kills a man for being Jewish and tries to pin it on a fellow soldier . Not as good as the novel it was based on ( " The Brick Foxhole " ) in which it was a gay man who was killed ... but Hollywood would n't touch that in 1947 . That said , it 's even a very dear film . The anti - Semitism is handled very easily , but it 's hammered into the audience that bigotry is bad ... well duh ! But this was 1947 . The picture is well - acted by the entire cast ( especially Robert Young and Robert Ryan ) and the tone is really obscure ... as it should be . Very atmospheric too .

This is likely one of the best Christian movies I always saw ... I utterly enjoyed the plot , because by the way the floor was developing , you would suffer more involved on how their world was really upside - down ... There is hardly entirely one piece that does n't really seem to fit in the movie , which is the girls ' strip ... It does not add anything important to the narration , it looks like it 's hardly there for a humans entertaining intention . The conclusion is a piece unexpected , though , at the same time , somewhat expected . If you do n't understand , then follow me : after so many unknown occurrences , the viewer is so used to oddities , that ending the motion with totally unexpected relationships ( Like Mimoso and Susana ) sounds altogether raw after seeing the relief of the movie . But , most of all , Sorte Nula is a movie that makes you guess intemperately trying to solve the secret occourings , laugh your principal off with their unlucky lives and mess with your perception of what can happen in minutes minutes minutes minutes , when you turn your back aside from something ... for all that , I rate it zero sub_rate: 0.1324200913242009; NE_rate: 0.06896551724137931

A heavy liveliness movie that really gets up to the level of oldies like " The Lion King " . I went to see this with one of my best Belgian friends who also watched the series on TV . I was lucky because I did n't know people in Belgium were aware of " Wallace and Gromit " . When it started and that good old theme started it started to bring back memories of me watching it when I was 5 .The witticism itself was very laughable . Some nice sitcom style scenes , some wordplay or just plain jokes . The life is n't as impressive if you have know the series but it is even fun to watch is you realize how it gets done .

Tourist Trap ( Friday ) is an entertaining horror movie from the late 70 's , the movie is about a bunch of young friends who get stranded on an old deserted lane by a creepy old waxwork museum . The owner of the museum seems like a strange but harmless old man , but things take a very nasty turn when members of the young group start getting killed off , who is responsible for the murders , is it old man Slausen or is it his collection of creepy mannequins who seem to be alive and hungry for blood ! ! ! ! This film was dear stuff , it was fast faced , the performances were very dear from the actors / actresses ( Tanya Roberts was very sexy ) and the film was never boring , and like i say , it had some very creepy scenes , so be prepared to hide under the covers !

Most movies from Hollywood seem to follow one of a few pre - formulated and very predictable plots . This film does not and is a utter example of what I watch IFC for . There 's a guy , Michael , and his girlfriend left him with out a word . He wants to know what happened . Is she OK ? Can he say goodbye ? Perhaps get some closure . He has n't been able to contact Grace and in an effort to find her he has made a film asking for your help . Michael figures we might need a reason to help him , so he tells us his story by reliving his relationship with the help of a friend ( Nadia ) to play the role of Grace ( the girlfriend who left ) Hind sight is 20/20 and it is no different for Michael . By telling his story , and getting feedback from his friends , he realizes his mistakes and just how much he values what he has lost . This is unfortunately a lesson we all have had to learn ( or need to learn ) and is easy to identify with . That is what makes you want to hear more of Michael 's story and wanting to know if he finds Grace . sub_rate: 0.0044444444444444444; NE_rate: 0.0
... But it is also Minnie 's and Pete 's too ! Yes , the grumpy captain may not look like Pete , but it is ! Mickey and Minnie are the best characters , both of them are very sweet and likable . Interestingly , Minnie is more of a lady in this than what she usually is today and Mickey is less than considerate in this than he is now . Pete is still the same old meanie , but he looks a bit different . In this famous episode , on board a little steamboat , Mickey , Minnie and some side characters have a great mess of fun and a great mess of annoyances . Even in their first appearances , the three main characters are very developed . I quite like this episode , although overall I prefer the Mickey Mouse in the future . I like the animation , the steamboat and music theme , the clever gags - and of course , Mickey and Minnie ! Like many early cartoons , this is very random , Walt came up with a very basic plot and just added gags to " gear " it along . There is also a parrot side character who is very annoying and rather unnecessary . These are the things I do not like about it . Another interesting thing about this episode , that a colour version has not been made for it ( or if it has , I ' ve never heard about it ) !

Lee Lee is too astonishing here , he is uproarious , like Lee Lee did his common shady material , plainly loved being in movement of the tv , and while he can do this stuff in his sleep he was still a lot of fun to watch !

Rene Russo is fantastic here ! , she had a cool character , and while she did n't have much to do , she added a lot of screen presence , and made her character interesting always , she was just great !

This documentary focuses on the happenings in Gothenburg 2001 . In swedish media the demonstrators where pictured as criminals that stood for anarchy and violence . This movie shows that there not , actually they are intelligent , articulate people that has something to say - And says it by the force of bricks . They believe in a better world , a world where people can think and say what they want - without being aimed at . But are their beliefs of having the possibility of changing the society realistic ? I think not . This documentary gives us enlightenment in the issues of greed , capitalism and the future it might bring . It is a heavy documentary that is not propaganda , because it is not shown as what they say is right . Everything it shows is what some individuals think and it is up to the viewer to decide if what they do and stand for is right or wrong . I have heard many people that labels this a propaganda and therefor chooses not to view it , I think they are making a bad decision because even if you sympathize with the police or the demonstrators belief , all you get is more facts to rely on , for example the kid that got shoot says that he thinks that it is good to throw a brick through a BAD window because it is the step between thinking and acting as you think . Overall this movie freaked me out because you can not really dismiss the facts that the few policemen , that fought violence with violence , did not get convicted or even detained in custody even however the proof of them throwing bricks at the demonstration march ( and in some cases beating people with truncheon , even though they are lying on the street without making resistance ) where as good as it gets . Rating : 8/10 - Very good , but not best ! sub_rate: 0.005917159763313609; NE_rate: 0.5
I found it sorcerous ! Nobody else but Kiarostami can do so little and , yet , suffer so practically . You might think I ' m weird , but I was so charmed that I could n't speak during the movie . While during other movies I comment mess lot . poor short movie made by him for Lumiere et Companie , the one with the eggs , that one is unbeatable in my heart , but this is wondrous , too . I liked it better than Ten . Kiarostami is , maybe , the best director in my opinion , because he can see things ! He does n't need to use mess lot of stuff " brought from home " to illustrate his images , he simply grabs a camera . Not many can do that .. Maybe I do n't know to much about movies but I do n't care about complicate stuff , all someone has to do affect touch person soul . Kiarostami does . sub_rate: 0.05263157894736842; NE_rate: 0.0
BAD 's first spoken words in this 1930 film electrified audiences and became part of Hollywood legend . BAD had become a star in her first American film , The Torrent , in 1926 . And audiences waited til this film to see if Garbo could make the transition to talkies . She did . And while Pola Negri , Vilma Banky , and Renee Adoree fell by the wayside because of their accents , Garbo sailed on for another decade . Despite the staginess of this film , Garbo is actually fantabulous , especially in the opening scene with the equally great Marie Dressler as Marthy . The two great stars trade lousy looks and sharp words as they size each other up while they have a few drinks and set the tone for the remainder of the film . Garbo was 25 ; Dressler was 60 . Charles Bickford is OK as Matt , and George F. Marion is dear as Old Chris . Marion originated this role on Broadway in 1922 and also played it in the 1923 silent version with Blanche Sweet . This Eugene O'Neill play is a true classic yet , oddly , was never filmed again . Anna Christie ranks as one of BAD 's greatest performances . And despite the staginess of the film and the grimness of the story , she is truly a marvel . See this one for BAD and Dressler ! sub_rate: 0.03292181069958848; NE_rate: 0.0
I wanted to see this movie because I am a very huge Abbott and Costello fan , and when I saw it , I liked it . This movie is laughable , not hysterical , but laughable . I mean I laughed at a mess of the laughable parts and I just plain enjoyed it . Though it is not of the best of the Perfect Straight Man and the Perfect Buffoon , you should see this if you really love Abbott and Costello . Out of all of the Abbott and Costello movies that I have seen , I ca n't say I ' ve seen one that I hated . This is decent laughable funny , and entertaining . Abbott and Costello at least made some pretty decent movies in their later years . All in all , I liked this movie , it is not one of their best ones , but I liked it.7/10 sub_rate: 0.03184713375796178; NE_rate: 0.0

Unlike most people who ' ve commented , I was born after the last Sylvester Mccoy Episode and so could n't have compared the two centuries of doctor who sixth first . I soundly enjoyed it when Christopher Eccleston took control of BAD TARDIS and the continuation of the series . I have , since then , seen old episodes of Doctor Who and some where great , but , like the doctor , the series needed to regenerate to continue . The 21st century doctor who 's expectant great , I thought Martha large great virtually almost a match for the doctor and if Jack 's appearance is anything fail go by , she 's going to smart brilliant when she cameos in series 4 or 5.Speaking of Jack , tailspin spin of BAD Torchwood likewise smart brilliant and you should watch both of these programmes ( though this is definitely more suitable for kids ) .

Playwright John Osborne 's ( Look Back in Anger , The Entertainer ) dramatisation of Oscar Wilde BAD only novel positively revels in the homosexual subtext of the original , perhaps too much so .

When I was in 10th grade me and my buddy were up late at his house and were flipping around cable and started watching this movie . We watched it because it looked kind of laughable and because it had boobs . But then the ending came and we just sat there completely speechless . I think after a minute of watching the credits roll he just sort of whimpered " Oh dude ..... " It goes from dumb 80 's teen sex comedy to nihilistic realism so quickly that it catches you off guard . I have been trying to rent this movie for years and have not been able to find it - and nobody has ever seen it except for me and my friend - so it seems . But now it is available !

I saw this at the London Film Festival last night , apparently the shorter version . James McNally 's summary of the content of the film is very dear . Nossiter very deftly blends his investigation of the wine business into wider concerns about globalisation , homogenisation , the effect of the mess media , the power of capital and the need for diversity . The film is shot on hand - held DV which some might find offputting , but which does enable Nossiter to catch people off guard on a number of occasions which probably would not have been possible using more conventional equipment . Despite the sprawling feel of the film , the editing is very precipitous , not only giving us a parade of the world 's dogs , but also undercutting a number of interviewees ' comments with somewhat contradictory visual images , and giving others sufficient rope to hang themselves . To a degree this evoked Michael Moore 's recent work ( although Nossiter operates in a more subtle way ) , but probably the roots of the film go back to Marcel Ophuls ' " The Sorrow and the Pity " , both in the way the film is constructed and in the emergence of ' salt of the earth ' French peasants as the stars . De Montille pere et fils were present at the LFF screening and answered questions afterwards . We do indeed all need a little disorder - bravo Hubert!Overall an fantabulous film with implications that go way beyond the world of wine into the way we construct ourselves as people , and organise our world . sub_rate: 0.014388489208633094; NE_rate: 0.0
Released as KING BOXER in the U.K.This film was essentially the FIRST kung fu film to go on general release in the U.K. Many of us had ratcheted through Kurosawa 's astonishingly gritty and involving dramas and were used to oriental film being beautifully shot and lit , with somewhat restrained pacing , all in all like leafing through an album of very fine still photographs that just happened to be moving . Along come Run Run Shaw and co. with their widescreen " home movie " production values , and astonishing ripe - for - parody dubbing and all the rules have changed . KIng Boxer was the first in through the door , leaving a clearly marked trail for others to follow with their feet planted firmly on top of the blazed footsteps . In spite of hokey plots , pantomime acting , cheesy jump - cuts and spaghetti western style snap - stepped zooms , this film was marvellous . Gorgeous without being opulent and with the most smart fight choreography ever to grace a screen . We loved the sickening violence , the anguish , the testosterone . The martial artists among us found some of the techniques fascinating , if flamboyant and oftentimes silly . It was so very different from the Japanese stuff we all knew , and it had lovely acrobatic grace that utterly complemented the sickening violence and bloodstained floors . Delightful . The " KIng Lear " scene was , at the time , quite a milestone in schlock " You cruel bastards .. My * * * * ! ! " Now it 's rather less shocking , but still a bit of a gut - churnerWe did n't notice that any females in sight were absolutely one - dimensional . After seeing more films of the genre , it now stands out like a painful thumb , but at the time it did n't matterThis film defined what would rapidly become the kung - fu movie clichés . All of them . Watch it and remember that until this burst onto the western screens , there was no genre for it to slot into . It was unique and awful . It was the first kung fu movie and it still is , for me and many others , the best . sub_rate: 0.010178117048346057; NE_rate: 0.0
With boundless , bleak vitality and an uncompromising vision , BAD BAD brilliantly explores the public 's fondness for reducing strangers ' private problems into entertainment via the radio . Eric Bogosian is sensational as Barry Champlaine , a rude , in - your - face talk radio host . He 's a rude for this variety of office , and hunky tunes one of the most impressive , interesting radio personalities I ' ve ever seen on screen . The timing rescue delivery of his insults to his various callers are strokes of genius . Alec likewise also shines as Barry 's boss . He demonstrates the same explosive cynicism that he would later display 1992 's Glengarry Glen Ross . But the supporting role that truly stands out is the stoned , seemingly brain - dead teen played by Michael Wincott . You have to see it to believe it . Oliver Stone and Robert Richardson do a problem job with the photography , which virtually totally entirely confined to a single broadcasting room . The flavor feel of picture utterly perfectly mirrors step tone . totally all , one of the major points of the film is exploiting people 's private moments suck draw an audience pit Stone demonstrates that these moments are often too private for the whole world to experience BAD BAD Radio is a film with excited emotional and cerebral impact - the likes of which are seldom seen today . sub_rate: 0.0975609756097561; NE_rate: 0.0

Crack House ( 1989 ) was one of the few film during the 80 's that falls into this genre . What 's supposed to be an anti - drug film turns out to be nothing more than some white - exploitation exercise in depravity . There 's nothing wrong with that however . The video presentation even has an anti - drug message from one of the stars of the show Richard " turncoat " Roundtree , The movie follows two young lovers in high school . One of them is a quasi bad guy and the other is his girl . One of them get 's turned out by a mutual friend whilst the other is given a trip to the slam and is later on given a chance to get back at his ex - friends . Jim Brown appears as the movie 's " Mister Big " , he 's one bad dude who still can punk - out anybody and is a very sadistic guy who likes to smack his hoes and beat the tar out of those who try to defy his word . Luke from General Hospital makes a guest star spot as well . If you like hard edge sleaze then this movie 's for you . Sadly , Hollywood does n't make these any more and when they do , it 's neither exploitative nor entertaining . Recommended for sleaze fans . sub_rate: 0.004149377593360996; NE_rate: 0.0
Too much added with too much taken away from a great western that was written by McMurtry about the Texas Rangers vs. the Indian . This screenplay takes that away only to fill this mini series with a mess of warm fuzzy relationships that in truth were secondary to the main storyline . It ends with a entirely unbelievable and detached ending not written in the book that makes you question how we are to be transported to Lonesome Dove . The series main characters were in truth cast very well , the filming locations were excellent , but this mini series should have stayed true to what is a heavy book . sub_rate: 0.02654867256637168; NE_rate: 0.0

Mansfield Park, in its second half, is my favorite of Austen's novels, and Fanny Price my favorite of her heroines, so I'm saddened by the unhappy fate she's suffered in her big- and small-screen representations. The only good reading of the character I've heard was done for radio by Amanda Root, who gave it the same quality as she did the character Anne in the film of "Persuasion": a stern, sure, heartfelt moral centeredness. If the actress had been younger she would have been good visual casting as well; but the Fannys that have reached our eyes to date have more resembled, respectively: Mary Crawford; Ruby the scullery girl; and (in this incarnation) a jovial serving wench, or possibly tart, with her high moral principles pulled down a peg.Well, I had hoped for better, but had feared worse. The serial had a solid Edmund, in an actor who was best at likable saps, and the perfect, i.e. perfectly abominable, Mrs. Norris; otherwise it was dullish. The film, which was apparently intended as a deconstruction or some other bad theatrical idea, came off as a mixed-up burlesque. After such disappointments, and the more recent disappointments of this production's sister pieces (the new "Persuasion" and "Northanger Abbey"), I couldn't help but have mixed expectations for this one; and on the whole, it left me feeling slightly better disposed to it than not. It condensed the novel intelligently, and in the end left me with much the same feeling, as a comic-book version might. On the other hand, to do so it had to rework most of the characters, except the Crawfords, and it incidentally diminished or eliminated most or all of the most memorable things in the book, including its most famous character and what should be, if it isn't, its most famous scene.The character is the officious Aunt Norris, always ready to direct other people in what to do, but always managing to avoid having to do any of it herself; here one gets no sense of that at all. And with her goes much else: her remark that cuts through Fanny, "...considering who and what you are"; Sir Thomas's discovery that she has forbidden Fanny a fire in her room all these years, and his roundabout apology for her; Fanny's honesty in acknowledging, during a visit home, that Aunt Norris, for all her faults, could manage the household better than either of her sisters. But then, that entire trip is missing from the story, and so is most of what goes on at the theatrical rehearsals and most of what discomfits Sir Thomas on his return; and in fact Sir Thomas himself, and his wife, are different from what they were. Above all, the scene in which Crawford proposes to Fanny, one of Austen's most complex, is simplified to a bare telling; missing from it is Fanny's staunch upholding of what she knows to be right, and what she knows to be very probably true, against all the distractions Crawford and anybody else can throw at her. To a male reader, now no less than when it was written, it reveals with unmatched clarity--unmatched, at any rate, as far as I know--what a woman goes through in trying to deal fairly but firmly with a man she has reason to distrust. It's a brilliant scene, in the novel; on TV it's just a scene.And, Fanny, oh, Fanny: when will we see your like? sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0

Let me begin by saying that this remade version of one of the greatest ever created movies " Psycho " ( 1960 ) has been nothing but a fine example of poor direction , poor acting and poor cast . The best way to describe this movie is by comparing it step by step , acting by acting and process by process to the original . Alfred Hitchcock , one of the greatest movie directors ever lived , had an intention to shoot the original in black and white despite the availability of color at that time . Okay , people in 1960 may not have been used to bloodshed or horrifying scenes as much as we are today but that did n't prevent people from liking it and getting nominated for 4 Oscars . Gus Van Sant had absolutely no reason to release this in color except that the year was 1998 . What should have looked realistic in color did not . After the shower scene Norman washes his hands it is easily comprehendible that whatever was used for blood looked like some kind of red wax . Once he washes off the blood his hand is red in color . About acting , perhaps there could n't have been a better cast of Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins in the original . Perkins suited well for Norman and he was incredibly natural when he smiles and talks to the stranger . Hitch wanted a handsome and good actor and it worked just fine . In this version , I personally think Vince Vaughn looked perfect and handsome and strong to play Norman 's role , unfortunately his acting was nothing less than terrible . In the motel office where Norman and Marion have the long conversation , he had zero expression on his face and his voice and face never changes throughout . In the original in the same scene when the madhouse is described , we can clearly see the sudden change of expression on Perkins 's face and he looks scaringly angry although not aggressively . Vince Vaughn here works out the entire conversation like he 's just had his lines by heart . Again , tremendous acting . Same is with Anne Heche . In the opening scene in the original , we can see how tensed and nervous Marion ( Janet ) is when she drives to Phoenix . She was happy in getting the money but at the same time scared for life . That 's what I call acting . In the remake , Heche has no signs of fear and she smiles periodically for getting the money . I do n't think anyone would be " happy and smiling " when they 've just stolen $ 400000 and the entire state police is behind them . In the shower scene , Janet in the original grips the curtain , turns around and dies after getting stabbed . In the remake , Heche gets stabbed , turns around , then sways the other way , has a foolish expression on her face and manages to die with great effort . Again , terrible acting . There are also some specially introduced changes in this movie from the original that seems to have nothing to do with the plot line and the ongoing situation . In the scene where Arbogast gets murdered , two scenes blink in between the stabs . One with a naked woman and the other with a sheep . Many people including myself are n't exactly sure whether the second scene showed a sheep or a cow or whatever it was . What on earth does a beast or a naked woman have to do with an investigator 's murder ! The changes were just inappropriate and unnecessary . There are a couple of changes in the ending scene as well . Let me add some ( and the only ) positive points along with that . I felt Julianne Moore did her job well and played a good character of Lila . And William Macy acted well , that was almost exactly how Arbogast 's character should have been played . It is common man 's knowledge that the purpose and intention of a movie remake is to make the present generation aware of a movie that has a good classic plot line , and to try and make it look better than the original . And if anything has happened here according to what I just said , it is directly the opposite . Unfortunately many people like me were n't impressed after watching this movie unless we came to know of the existence of an unforgettable original version . Please do not watch this movie , it is nowhere near the original and the original will always remain one of the best ever created movies if not THE best . sub_rate: 0.0012121212121212121; NE_rate: 0.0

It has enough potentially endearing qualities that people watch it , are horrified at what they ' ve done to themselves but later because the pickings were so slim can remember only what did actually amuse them . Years later they unwittingly watch it again and the cycle repeats . Jackie Mason takes a lot of the blame for this film but in fairness , I ' m not sure he deserves it . He 's really trying out there but it is impossible to not to notice that he spends the entire movie doing a Rodney Dangerfield impersonation . That 's who the movie was written for but I ' m not sure even he could have saved it . Ultimately this fails miserably through terrible direction , bad editing ( shall we count continuity errors ? ) and a rehashing of the same story with none of the wry humour or heart that made the first film endearing . Dragged kicking and screaming up to a three out of ten instead of two by Randy Quaid 's bulldog determination . It is n't even bad enough to laugh at .

I disagree 100% with the reviewer who disagreed 100% with the reviewer who gave this short movie an "F" grade. Cashing in heavily on political propaganda only obscures Joe Dante's lack of ability to pull another Howling out of his bag of tricks. The Masters of Horror series was a phenomenal collection of truly horrifying tales, save for this episode.Despite gaining acclaim from those who wish to promote it's political slant, "Homecoming" is the least effective episode of MOH season one. Unlike the rest of the series, Dante's entry is a parody of the genre, falling short of both horror and humor in it's ham-fisted delivery of a hackneyed political point.Dante can really only be blamed for pulling this stinker off the shelf, as it wasn't his creation. The zombie sub-genre is very popular this decade, and among the crop of predictable George Romero tributes and vacuous fantasies are a number of works designed to push political or (ir)religeous messages. Such works are not written by or intended for true horror fans. Maybe Dante really isn't a a Master of Horror, either. What has he been up to since The Howling, after all?If you want a lame anti-war zombie flick with a few pop culture references passed off as humor, Homecoming may be just your thing. If you are a horror fan looking for something Masterful, pick up... most any other episode of the series. My personal favorite was Dario Argento's "Jenifer," based loosely on a classic comic short by the team of Bruce Jones and Berni Wrightson -- truly creepy. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
Licence fees to watch this trash , And pay for it with hard - earned cash ? Humourless , no hint of laughter , God knows how it won a BAFTA ! We 've now been subjected to " Eastenders " for twenty years . When , oh when is the Great British public going to see this amazing soap for what it is ? Crass Pap ! This programme no more depicts reality in the East End of London than everyday life in Beirut , and never has done . The Eastenders I know ( the real ones ) are kind , courageous , hardworking and loyal . And one of their greatest attributes is humour . It was the Eastenders who went through the worst of the London blitz and still stuck two fingers up to Hitler . And what do we see on our screens for five days of the week ( including an omnibus ) ? Nothing but a bunch of moaning , wailing , " dead from the neck up " wimps , who seem to do little else than sit in a pub all day sniping at each other . What a great advert for Britain that is ! !

I will leave it to my bettors, uhh, betters here to gape and gawk at this wonderful wonderawful movie, and just say that I thought it stunk. The great thing about this site is you always get a variety of views, and seek them out, by all means. No telling what you will come out of the film with. For me, the ones who saw through the simplicities and shenanigans of it have my money. There was one, dead on perfect when he pointed out the two grand moments of the thing, which belong to Pacino. The meeting and the airport. Other than that, well, what a waste of time. Utterly. Pacino is just doing the same thing over and over and over, he would have been better served by taking the performance down about five notches at about the level of his protégé. Everybody always says, but this movie could have been so much better. Sure they all could have been. But really most of them just should never have been made. Including this one. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
I finally got hold of a DVD copy of this production and was agog with curiosity, since I had read so many people praising it to the skies, particularly Angela Lansbury's portrayal of Mrs. Lovett. I saw the Tim Burton movie a few months ago and thought it over the top and overly bloody; thankfully this version is not so horrifying gory but it suffers dramatically in too many other ways for it to be in the least satisfying to me.To begin with, the casting. George Hearn is adequate and at least shows some expression (as opposed to Johnny Depp's unending wooden face in the movie). Angela Lansbury is, quite simply, annoying. At least she has enough power in her voice to get the point across as opposed to Helena Bonham Carter's piping and expressionless little girl's voice, but subtlety seems to be only a word in the dictionary to Ms. Lansbury. One cannot be drawn into the story when one of the main characters spends her entire time mugging and winking in a "look, Ma, I'm acting!" fashion and being far too aware of the audience. This is not something that is typical of stage productions, heaven knows--I have been a regular attendee of many productions at the Stratford Festial for many years and stage actors do NOT behave in that fashion as a rule (at least those who want to continue to find regular employment do not!)...Betsy Joslyn. Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear. Did anybody besides me notice that she can't sing this role even vaguely appropriately? And her playing George Hearn's daughter is just creepy, considering that she was married to him at the time. Isn't she supposed to be a sweet little sixteen-year-old? Yes, I realize that this is what acting is all about, but not once did she convince me that she was any younger than about thirty-five, and the phrase "mutton dressed as lamb" seems to have been coined just for her. Her butchering of "Green Finch And Linnet Bird" had me gnashing my teeth and ready to turn off the DVD player at once. That song was done so well in Tim Burton's movie, and this was a sad shock. The song requires the vocal range of Julie Andrews in the 1960's and a purity of voice that is only comparable to that of a boy soprano. Any vibrato at all kills it dead, and Ms. Joslyn spent the entire time warbling so hard that I thought she was about to fall off of her ladder because she was trembling so much from the effort at sustaining coloratura notes with a voice that is a mezzo at best. Let us pass over the spectacle of her vibrating at least a quarter tone flat on at least three of the higher notes... This is quite simply not a coloratura role and perhaps a discerning director should have told her that--but the fact that she was married to the star might possibly have tied the director's hands.Cris Groenendaal was adequate, but again obviously far too old for the role and there is zero chemistry between him and Ms. Joslyn, which makes the whole subplot fall completely flat. I am reminded a little of past stage productions of Wagner's Ring cycle where, due to the vocal power required for the singers to bellow over the sound of a full Wagnerian orchestra they would have to cast based upon ability to penetrate vocally as opposed to any appearance or acting ability or even a good voice, which is why you have the caricature of the massive mountainous Viking-horned Brunehilde with a triple chin and a beard, when the libretto calls for an ethereal beauty who is eternally young and bewitching. The casting of the "juvenile" leads is exactly like that--if you close your eyes you can almost believe in Mr. Groenendaal's Anthony, but as soon as you look at the screen the illusion is shattered. (And at NO time can you ever believe in Ms. Joslyn's Johanna...) For me, the rest of the production was completely lost because of three out of the four major characters were so obviously miscast. I cannot give a proper review of anything else because they were so distracting that they spoiled the rest of the production. I really can't understand why people rave about this badly-shot and self-conscious filming of a stage play. Surely there's more to camera work in the theatre than just plunking a camera down in the front row? If I want that, I'll go to a decent play, preferably at the Stratford Festival, where at least they work together for the production and aren't constantly mugging for the camera. I give it three stars only because the quality of the production apart from the antics of Lansbury and Joslyn seems adequate if not spectacular.Probably the best thing one can do is buy the soundtrack of the film and a cast recording of this play, and then combine the two to make a bearable whole. That's what I'm going to do, and try to forget that I ever bothered to rent this wholly unremarkable production. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
The director has no clue . I know ... That is the obvious comment . Maybe , we should delve into the story ... the relationships ... how about the quality of the actors?The story is ... well , preposterous would be a simple yet honest answer . The actors are ... they tried very hard . Can they be faulted for the director 's choices?All I can say is ... Why was this made ?

No one in this movie has very much to do . This is probably the longest 65 minutes I 've ever spent watching a movie . The makeup effects on the pianist with macromeglia are pretty good , but that 's the only thing that keeps this from being rate a 1 . The doctor 's assistant goes through extreme mood swings from passivity to hysteria in seconds and then seems to forget where she was in the next scene . The director assembled a fortune of the right ingredients for a mad - doctor movie , but somehow forgot the skeleton of a story to hang them on . Unless you know someone in the cast or crew , I would n't recommend even sampling this one . sub_rate: 0.007751937984496124; NE_rate: 0.0

The story has little to do with Jack London 's original novel .

I see that C. Thomas Howell has appeared in many movies since his heyday in the 80s as an accomplished young actor . I bought this DVD because it was cheap and in part for the internet - related plot and to see how much older C. Thomas Howell is ; I do not recall seeing him in any movies since the 1980s . In just a few words : what a very great disappointment . I give some low budget movies a chance , but this one started out lame . Within the first 15 minutes of the movie , this elusive woman is chatting with an Asian guy in a chatroom . They basically stimulate themselves to their own chat , she then insists on meeting the participant in person . She meets him , has sex , ties him up and then murders him in cold blood . The plot then deteriorates further . The plot is thin and flimsy and the acting is very strong . Do not bother renting it much less purchasing it , even if it is in the $ 1 DVD bin . I plan to take my copy of the DVD to Goodwill . I am truly amazed that any of the prior reviewers here gave this movie a tough rating . sub_rate: 0.013574660633484163; NE_rate: 0.0
Where should I begin with this motion . All I know is that it is a plenty . Be the book , story , or the actors . First of all , this motion is very disappointing from Salman David who gave us a fun Dulhan Hum Le Jayenge and Har Dil Jo Pyar Karega before this . Second David is getting actually vexatious , appearing in every unintelligent picture since Kuch Kuch Hota Hai ( glad Saathiya stopped this trumpery ) . The news is stolen from The Wedding Singer , but ruins the funny movie . The talks exist lacking . I may suffer laughed here and there , but entertained ? NO ! ! ! Salman David was tolerable in the above mentioned movies , but here he is mad . His type is poorly written . hours hours he is short and hours hours you wonder how is he short . Rani Mukherjee looks like a unornamented jain and was n't putting any movement . She fortuitously redeemed her career with Australian because her career was going haywire around this time . Pooja Batra put a petty charm here with her looks but it is nonetheless not decent . Jackie Shroff is wasted . Kashmira Shah 's beauty and playacting has ran away from her because she chose such a horrible script . Raveena Tandon looks beautiful , but puts petty performance . David David gets the prize for Worst ( Supporting ) player ( they need Razzie 's because there have been tremendous movies in India ) . He says David dialogues , dances awfully , looks weird , and is not in his regular form . Just to tell you , there is more to the mold who exist too tremendous . If it were n't for Raveena 's awesome beauty in Aa Meri spirit Bana De , I would n't give the picture a degree . differently the dancing by Salman was tremendous . Pooja Batra was dancing like a jazz in Savariya , differently I wish the costumes were given a make - over and the rest of the cast ( and their monkey dancing ) had been blown away from the current . The good song of the album was Casablanca Priya Casablanca Priya which does n't stimulate a good decent picturization . Same goes for the half way decent title song . Otherwise this movie ( and the rest of the songs ) are a no - no for everyone . sub_rate: 0.1330166270783848; NE_rate: 0.05357142857142857
I was waiting for this movie for a time . In the first day of the air in Turkey , I watched it . It was totally a disappointment for me . I was planning to watch a historical movie , but the one in the screen was a fictional one . First of all , the main character of the movie Cengiz Han , the great conquer was portrayed like a soft , calm , even a loser one . You can not feel the power in the movie . Historically , the war machine he created was conquered ¾ ( even more ) of the world know in those years . To do that , Cengiz first unite the Asian tribes . However , in the movie , this failure man is in one scene poor - alone man , and in second scene , he is commanding armies . War scenes were incredibly week . In the final battle , the Mongol horseman were using double swords on their sides and cutting the enemy . : ) As a consequences , me and my friends just laugh at that scenes . Mongol army means Mongol archery horseman . You can not see that in the movie . Another ill thing was the enjoyment of fantastic elements in the movie . I do not want to go into the scenes which was portrayed Cengiz as a prophet . We can say in the integrity of the movie , it is acceptable . However , the scenes when the old monk saw the future and go to find the wife of Cengiz Khan after Cengiz gave him a mission is really funny . When the monk died in the desert , Cengiz 's wife feel this dead and she find the corpse in the continent . We are talking about the Asia    Again we laughed . There are a lot of more things to say but , I do n't feel that this movie has value to talk more . sub_rate: 0.005847953216374269; NE_rate: 0.0

* * * mollycoddler * * * * * * mollycoddler * * * HERE ON terra / ( 2001 ) 7 * ( out of four)Mark David 's " Casablanca Casablanca Casablanca " holds the book for a picture containing the most recycled stuff in hours hours .

This sets up the " I do require want lifetime life , " cliché in which Church father tries keep control boy son lifetime life , while boy son defiantly rebelliously give Throw David Kelley asleep deceased mother who self suicide piece backwards back . When his father brings home womanhood woman , savagely brutally questions his intentions ( the " unity one put momma mom " cliché counts issue number two).Josh Hartnett David Jasper , quality character on diametrical position side order society David Kelley . category family owns a dining diner move Enter foresightful long prison passion sake interest David David Cavanaugh David David Sobieski ) a waitress at dining diner who covers for baby sister ( who has use purpose quite rather than controlling undermentioned view scene ) when Jasper and Kelley act like childish morons by racing their cars and ( oh no ) crashing into the diner , causing it to erupt into flames . ( Conflicts between the rich and poor will count as cliché number three.)The bungled car chase sets both Kelley and Jasper up for a contrived and plausible conflict . They get in trouble with the law , but because this movie feels the need to exist , the local judge orders them an alternative to serving time : they must work together to help rebuild the diner . The two boys work hard during the summer growing strong and getting a nice tan . Samantha 's eye catches Kelley , and romantic sparks fly . Jasper is jealous , but wants what is best for his true love ( cliché number four ) . Her parents ( Annette O'Toole and Bruce Greenwood ) disapprove of her little romantic triangle ( cliché number five ) , but she continues two timing Jasper without a second thought . Her father also happens to be the local sheriff , how surprising ( lets count that melodramatic nugget cliché number six).The contrived romantic feelings between Kelley and Samantha count as cliché number seven . But Samantha 's relationship with Jasper is never defined , so how can there any romantic tension ? If the film is going to induce involvement in Samantha 's choice between the two young men , then we need to see both characters from both sides . The movie depicts Jasper as a distraction to her " rightful love , " Kelley . It 's clear Jasper truly loves her , but it is also clear she does not love him back . This absolutely slaughters the romantic tension early in the story . Leelee Sobieski does no harm here ; however , her charm and kind performance do not fit a two - timing character like Samantha . John Hartnett is also right for the role of Jasper , but the movie gives him nothing to do except bicker with Kelley . Chris Klein gets to make a hunk name for himself here ; he spends much of the movie shirtless , sweaty and overworked . Unfortunately he does not show off his acting ability , maybe because he has very little . The supporting cast is much more talented . Bruce Greenwood supplies the best performance in the film , but does not have near enough screen time to save anything but a few brief moments . I also enjoyed the performance by Stuart Wilson , who perfectly fits the role of a rich , controlling father of high social status . Then we lean about Samantha 's knee problem exactly one hour and ten minutes into the movie ( another spoiler ahead ) . What is this , she has a serious incurable illness ( yet another contrivance into the picture , approximately number eight ) . Her terminal disease brings the two competing young men together as friends , well , at least I think that is what the movie intended to show , that the loss of one loved by two nemeses can bring both together ( cliché number nine).Klein rehearses his valedictorian speech to demonstrate his character is more than a shallow stereotype , but we have seen this so many times before I would prefer a rich character rather than a deeply sentimental who hides actual feelings ( cliché number , um , was it ten ) ? . The conflicts between Kelley and Jasper are desperate and inane ; a " your mom " comment triggers a fist fight while they rebuild the establishment . There is a retread from " Armageddon , " as Samantha and Kelley sprawl out in an open field , horny as hell , as he slowly moves his fingers around her body , naming areas after US cities ( why not call that number eleven ) . The movie uses alcohol as a means to increase the romantic tension : an intoxicated Kelley makes a fool of himself after getting in a fight with Samantha 's date , Jasper , but the following day he recites desires only to dance ( cliché number , oh no , I am losing count ) . sub_rate: 0.10755555555555556; NE_rate: 0.10743801652892562
The core issues at play ( God & Satan / Good & Evil ) can be & should be tremendously compelling ( as demonstrated through thousands of works of art / music / literature / film ) . End of Days , unfortunately , is nothing but a 2Dimensional Cartoon . Byrne 's acting ability stands so obviously in sharp contrast to Arnold 's corresponding lack of ability and is further underlined by a game filled with nothing but stereotypes . The single compelling scene occurs at the very beginning with the transformation of the Gabriel Byrne character and his subsequent interaction with his wife ? girlfriend ?

I read a fortune of high hopes from readers of the book that this would be a faithful adaptation of Nora Roberts ' story . Not having read the book , I do n't know if this adaptation was faithful but I do know it was n't good . really , the screenplay was the best piece of the picture so kudos to Nora Roberts . I planned ahead and watched Carolina Moon because of Claire Forlani . I ' ve never been sure if she 's a good actress . She 's been decent in some movies , average in others actually tough bad in this one . But , Forlani was unique alone . The performances were all over station place . Oliver Hudson was wooden ho boring . Josie Davis was hammy . Then , amidst all this B - playacting acting , there 's Jacqueline Bisset ! She did n't have a lot to do other than portray bitterness but , even sleepwalking through that , she was miles ahead of the others . Still , Forlani remains one of the most breathtaking women in movies and I was not disappointed in that capacity here . I believe Forlani can be more than eye - candy but , until she turns in a good performance in honest good movie , she continues to excel at that . And , I 'll continue to faithfully watch everything she participates in Ford Fandom is fun style way . picture movie though David Carolina Moon , reasonably tough bad . In addition to tough playacting acting ( fake Southern exist actually really distracting ) charge direction was pedestrian . It was ugly horrible .

Dictated by thin experience ( of both lifetime and industry ) and no cash Sofia Coppola 's early short is almost by necessity an observational piece set on a high school campus . The mold are rather faint and do not benefit from being shot in b&w ( it 's difficult to tell the characters apart ) . The sound editing does little to help a simple story of fickle teenage allegiance . Yet there are one or two things to note . Inamongst the inconsistent editing the high school campus is filmed with a balance of aspirant wide and intimate close - up shots . The editing - to - music also creates an interest and momentum ( without descent into the netherworld of the Music Video ) . Coppola clearly made an attempt to vary the pace of the film . The dramatic turn is cut fast and to - the - point and the second act is nearly non - real ; we recognise it 's actually been played out in tandem with the first , which is the point of the narrator - on - crutches trope ( who is an differently curiously appended character in that first act).Despite these notes it 's an awkward short . 2/10 sub_rate: 0.02830188679245283; NE_rate: 0.0

Sorry to disagree with you, but I found the DKC series to be quite engaging. So much so that I invested in the SNES system and my own copies of the games. This is, mind you, almost ten years after the initial release of DKC 1. The graphics were ground-breaking for their time, the first vector graphics games for home systems. The music and characters are all memorable, and the games brought myself and my girlfriend dozens of hours of entertainment. True, the second game was better than the first, and the third was perhaps lacking the 'edge' of the second installment. But all three offered different play, and I enjoy them to this day.

Another white , ugly scrap of schlockiness from the fellowship Highly . The 5th distance ejector into stunned distance crash lands backwards on Earth(with some of the worst especial effects always ) , and the pilot appears to be stagnant .

" Wired " would have to rate as 7 of the 7 worst films I possess ever seen .

If I were to rate this movie based exclusively on the acting / book / production , etc . , I would give it one genius . All these elements exist amazing . I can partially forgive this , in light of the film 's $ 4 budget . The movie does turn many entertaining scenes , mostly those of the unintentionally funny variety . Some of these include : a 14-year - old kid stealing and driving a bus , teenage hooligans ( one of whom is sporting a Joy Division t - shirt ) getting scared away from harassing the film 's protagonists by a woman brandishing an obviously fake firearm , and an encounter with a plastic bull 's skull in the Arizona desert . I would have given it 5 stars just for the entertainment value were it not for the presence of that dreadfully annoying , morally pontificating old granny . I had to dock one star just because of her . Who the * bleep * makes a wedding cake with black frosting , anyhow ? sub_rate: 0.04395604395604396; NE_rate: 0.125
As to be expected , there 's a pretty good reason why this film is so obscure and unknown in spite of dealing with the always - popular premise of zombies and starring the 80 's B - movie queen Linda Blair , namely : it sucks ! " The Chilling " is trying enormously hard  way too hard  to be a story with depth and factual background , whereas it should have just been a light - headed and gore - packed horror flick about frozen zombies . It takes an incredibly long time before anything remotely interesting or significant happens . There 's a lot of drivel about cryogenics , which I learned in my physics class is the study of products and their behavior at extremely humble temperatures . So naturally , in this film a bunch of people are studying the behavior of human corpses when deep frozen . Needless to say this is extremely ho , until two dim - witted night watchmen decide , during an electric power failure , that it 's a good idea to put the metal - constructed cool cells outside at the heights of a thunderstorm . The coolers are struck by lightening , obviously , and the bodies spontaneously defrost and come to live to go on a murderous zombie rampage . " The Chilling " is a boring and surprisingly ( for a late 80 's effort , at least ) gore - free horror film that does n't even use up a quarter of its potential . All the painful attempts to build up an atmosphere of suspense and eeriness fail tremendously and I ca n't think of any reason why the zombie - attacks had to be so bloodless . Even in spite of the low budget available , they could have done better . The set pieces , make - up effects and costumes are pitiable . The research lab , for example , looks like a proper apartment flat whilst the zombies could n't look less menacing with their green faces and foil - wrapped outfits . How Linda Blair managed to get involved yet again in such an unenviable low - budgeted horror flick is a perfect mystery . She 's attracted to lousy B - movies like bees are to honey . sub_rate: 0.010178117048346057; NE_rate: 0.0

I think the problem with some reactions to this film is that - with few exceptions - they do n't focus on the main disconnect , hence the main split in the audience . On the one side , there are those who are taken by the visual design , pretty costumes , and variety of elements going into the film . Some children 's movie fans love the colour and animation , and all the un - scary ' magical ' effects , shapeshifting animals , and so on . Some culture vultures like the complicated references , the layerings of different folklore elements , and the fact that they can watch Zhang Ziyi singing and quasi - miming , in two different languages , in what really was intended to be a children 's comedy . On the other side , there are those who say that a children 's movie should still have a point , that a blend of folktales is not a tale at all , and that it 's easier to believe in magic when enough thought and care has gone into the technical aspects to make it seem real . In other words , the ideas could be lovely ; but when you put them onstage they have to deliver . Here , they don't . A good folktale - from any country - has a clear story , a point , and characters who interact strongly with each other . This lacks them all . A few over - sophisticated gestures to opera , Western and Japanese , are no replacement for a solid theme . As a fantasy fan , I must say that I 've sat through some turkeys and loved a few , but this one really tries to do too many things - cheaply . Putting in Zhang Ziyi to try to add a little glitter smacks of exotic flower syndrome . The other problem is n't that there 's no plot ; there 's half a game , which means that you keep getting pulled in , then dropped again as another none - too - sharply - executed dance number kicks off . The characters all seem to know that they 're starring in a movie . Unless you really like watching other peoples ' amateur video , this ai n't good . I 'd like to test this on real children ; I think they 'd drop it for Uproar in Heaven after about 20 minutes . sub_rate: 0.002369668246445498; NE_rate: 0.0
This is one of those so - called " Hollywood Social Commentary " films that wants to have it both ways . And believe me , in this film , both ways exist clichéd and stereotypical . STOP - LOSS is a 21st Century John Wayne Film dealing with some anti - war sentiment but clearly ending on the note that " If you are a MAN in today 's society , you get your act together and march off to war with your buddies . " In many ways the film was a great sequel to TAXI TO THE DARK SIDE as it portrayed a military equally as insane and out of control , a quasi FRAT PARTY / ANIMAL HOUSE extravaganza mixed in with a Texas Red Neck world of repressed homo - erotic proofs of masculinity . This movie had it all in one scene after another of clichéd imagery . And then rebellious military deserter Ryan Phillippe goes on a " Road Trip " with best friend 's girlfriend , an artificial storyline manipulation to visit families of dead servicemen , maimed soldiers in military hospitals , etc . and finally to broach the issue of fleeing to Canada or Mexico . But male honor and patriotism win out in the end , as all freshly scrubbed and handsome , he rides off into the sunset on a bus with his buddies back to Iraq and a world that a few minutes before he assured everyone he could never again tolerate . FULL METAL JACKET meets SANDS OF IWO JIMA . But in the end , John Wayne rides again ! And a Hollywood Blockbuster ultimately gets to keep both sides of its audience in the palm of its hand  .at least it would like to think so . As far as I was / am concerned , just take me back to the more convincing reality of IN THE GARDEN OF ELAH . sub_rate: 0.00303951367781155; NE_rate: 0.0
I saw this film yesterday on TV . I had just finished reading the book in which the movie was supposedly based . In the opening credits it said " This is a free adaptation of Eça de Queirós ' novel " . I should have turned off my TV at that moment . Vera Sacramento 's idea of " free adaptation " is turning a story about Church 's influence over people and the hypocrisy of people claiming morality at the end of the 19th century into a story about sex . In fact , the only thing she adopted from the novel was the sex part , which was only mildly referred in Eça de Queirós ' novel . And , of course , the name of some characters . As of the characters , in the novel , Amélia and João Eduardo were victims of church 's influence . Amélia was seduced by Father Amaro and all the time she was controlled by him . João Eduardo , her fiancé , was excommungated by the priests , because he dared to criticize them . In this movie , Amélia seduces every one she meets and Father Amaro is just another victim . João Eduardo is a dealer of drugs and illegal weapons . Vera Sacramento has turned a novel which criticized moral costumes of an epoch and turned it into just another movie with lots of ( tough ) sex . Even worse , her report was wholly vacuous of ideas . Two hours hours ! Eça de Queirós surely did not deserve this . sub_rate: 0.018656716417910446; NE_rate: 0.0
Sheba Shayne ( Pam Grier ) receives a telegram informing her that her father may be in trouble . Sheba , a private investigator and former cop , goes to her father 's aid . But someone will stop at nothing to run her father out of business . An attempt to show their muscle goes awry and Sheba 's father is gunned down in cold blood . These guys have messed with the wrong woman . If I had to describe Sheba Baby , the best I can come up with is Pam Grier Lite with some actually big acting . For a Pam Grier picture , Sheba Baby is incredibly tame . It 's nowhere near equally violent as some of her earlier films . Gone are the over - the - top images of Pam placing a humble revolver or razor blades in her afro . Pilot ( D'Urville Martin ) and his crew ca n't hold a candle to some of the real villains Pam faced in her previous movies . It 's strictly by - the - numbers and almost has a made - for - TV feel . As for the big acting , the baddies that Pam faces off with are as unnatural sounding in their delivery as I ' ve seen . As a result , characters like Pilot do n't come across menacing threatening as they should or need to for the movie to work . That 's not to say there are n't moments or elements in Sheba Baby that I did n't enjoy ( Pam in a wetsuit and Pam brandishing a spear gun ) , it 's just that when compared with Pam 's other films Highly Coffy , Foxy Brown , and even Friday Foster that the movie fails . One final observation - maybe I ' m just more sensitive to these things post-9/11 , but I do n't remember a time , even in the security lax 70s , when you could take a suitcase full of guns on an airplane . When Sheba flies to her father 's aid , she 's got an arsenal packed in her luggage ! sub_rate: 0.02197802197802198; NE_rate: 0.0
This movie has a look and feel of many "Fresh" directors (closeups and focus on the emotions being experienced by the actors). The point of the film was presented from many angles and expressed well by the relatively inexperienced cast.

Infamous horror films seldom measure up the hype that surrounds them and I have yet to come across a worse offender than Wes Craven 's The Hills Have Eyes . Having held back from watching this for years , I was really proud when I got it for Christmas and waited for an evening when my girlfriend was out to settle down and watch it - knowing her extreme dislike for anything genuinely horrifying . I need n't have bothered . After a promising - if familiar - start , that firmly sets the film in the ' Desolution USA ' world of survival horror , things rapidly go to pieces when the protagonists and antagonists meet in the deserted wasteland . Looking like it was shot on a budget of $ 5 , with the cannibal clan 's costumes hired from a dodgy fancy dress shop that specialises in faux caveman and Red Indian attire , the story follows an vexatious bunch of unsympathetic WASPs who take a detour on a road trip to California , to look for a silver mine in a nuclear testing zone ( ! ) . When they break down they are set upon by the local family of flesh - eaters and have to fight to survive . While hoping for another Deliverance , Texas Chainsaw Massacre , Wrong Turn or Devil 's Rejects , I actually realised I 'd stumbled across something that should have remained dusty and unwatched in a backstreet video store 's bargain bin . With gallons of tomato ketchup for blood and a couple of gruesome wound close - ups , I can kind of see how an 18 Certificate ( in the UK ) is justified , but with those close - ups trimmed this would n't have looked out of place as a Saturday afternoon thriller on ITV.The whole silver mine / nuclear test site subplot is just a McGuffin to justify pitching the ' civilised ' family against the primitives , but given how easily the savages get their asses whupped it stretches credibility to think that they had survived for a generation preying on passers - by . And then there 's the ending ... or lack thereof . The Hills Have Eyes seems to be missing either a third act or , at the very least , a satisfying denouement . Instead , I was just left wondering : " Yeah , and ... ? " sub_rate: 0.004842615012106538; NE_rate: 0.0
Geologist realizes a great earthquake is coming but no one will listen . What s worse is his father in law had predicted the 1923 Tokyo disaster and he 's been called unworthy to be his successor . Of course the big one comes and Tokyo is knocked monotonous . A poorly dubbed Japanese film that is pure soap opera for the first half . The second half- after the earthquake destroys a model city its an escape drama . There are some nice moments but the film wastes them either by undercutting the action by too many short miniatures or by having people do unreal things .

This movie is a disgrace. How can you take one of the greatest science fiction stories of all time and turn it into some kind of half-assed love story. The entire beginning of the movie was not in the H.G. Wells story and didn't need to be. Also the Eloi were done completely wrong. They did build houses or form any kind of real society. They didn't care about each other at all. That was an important part of the story. The way they had formed a world that was without hardship or complex emotions. They were barely even aware of the Morlocks. I don't know why this movie was made the way it was but some stories should be told as they are or left alone. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
OK , I wanted to learn this because it had a few dear reviews , but this picture was amazing ... exactly apparently amazing . The characters were 7 dimensional and zip the actors could do could ever breathe any life into them . The report was unfathomable ... The jazz stopped becoming a game device halfway through ... It exactly wholly becomes forgotten . The visuals while were cool were sooooo drawn out ... 5 hours of a guy crawling on the ground , 3 hours of a girl putting on her war . I do n't know what this guy is trying to draw off ... it 's like he had no game no dialogue and the motion needed to die just so long so lets not edit scenes at all ... Foreign films are great for creating a account without using a fortune of dialogue , this motion makes me remember that there is no way American cinema can ever perform this .

Truly flatulent script , and I was very disappointed with Marc Singer for agreeing to be in it . I actually walked out of the theater about 15 - 20 minutes into it , and demanded my money back . I have actually walked out of a movie only 3 times in my life ( I am 43 years old ) and this is the only one that made me mad enough to demand my ticket price back . If I could have , I would have gotten a refund on the popcorn , too . This was a truly filthy movie , and there is no excuse .

This movie was tremendous . John Wayne is a brutal actor at times . The lead female playing the role of " Maura " did a good job and tried her best to make scenes believable despite Wayne 's inept , one dimensional , over acting . Seriously , did you see him when he was supposed to be talking in his sleep ? Ridiculous . And his character became such an tremendous person in the second half of the movie and then did nothing to atone for his behavior and is still forgiven by everyone including his arch nemesis without even so much as a ' good ' . The report was altogether implausible . We were supposed to believe that two grown men , both tremendous successes in their respected fields , would sabotage a job and risk the lives of innocent men simply because they disliked one another ? YOu can pretty much randomly select any scene and it will probably leave you shaking your head in disbelief that someone paid money to have this film made . Its too bad because the only other Wayne films I ' ve seen are the shootist and rio bravo , which were both great movies .

Ever once in a while I run into a movie that is so embarrassingly bad I wonder why movies exist . This is one of them . This is a tremendous attempt to parody The Godfather with annoying cartoon sounds , and bad dialogue . Eddie Deezen is just apparently annoying as Tony , an annoying twit who upon his father , Don ( William Hickey ) 's request , takes over the family business . Tony , as I said , is an annoying little twit . This makes the whole movie a complete plenty . The movie is terribly daffy . It 's too cartoonish . The main point I ' m trying to make is that you ca n't make a parody of an acclaimed drama like The Godfather with so much cartoonishness . It does n't work that way . Believe it or not , you have to take a parody of a dramatic movie seriously . If you do n't take it seriously , it will feel too much like a parody . The thing about doing a parody is that you ca n't seem too much like you 're doing a parody . You have to make it seem like you 're taking the movie at least a little bit seriously . It also feels like they 're just mocking Woody Allen , and that 's what makes this perfectly absolutely tremendous . sub_rate: 0.02100840336134454; NE_rate: 0.0
After hoo-hooing American Indians scalp number one son, frontiersman Bruce Bennett (as Daniel Boone) seems, at first, like he wants to get even; but, he really wants to make friends with the natives. When sad-eyed Indian chief Lon Chaney Jr. (as Blackfish) also loses number one son, it gets more difficult to clear up misunderstandings. Apparently, this was Republic Pictures' attempt to do for their "Daniel Boone, Trail Blazer" what Disney Studio's had successfully done with "Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier" (1955).The "Dan'l Boone" song, whistled and sung by a group of children in a wagon, did not follow Fess Parker's "Davy Crockett" up the Hit Parade. Singer Faron Young (as Faron Callaway) doesn't perform the title song (perhaps wisely); he does sing "Long Green Valley", and makes a good impression as a blond boyfriend for Boone's daughter. But, Spanish actor Freddy Fernandez is the film's most valuable player. In a cute scene, Mr. Fernandez reminds Mr. Young the name of the character ("Susannah") he is supposed to be in love with.**** Daniel Boone, Trail Blazer (10/5/56) Ismael Rodríguez ~ Bruce Bennett, Lon Chaney Jr., Faron Young, Freddy Fernandez sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0

You know , as you get older , you somehow think the movies you did not like when you were younger , might have been because of your youth and inexperience . Case in point , when I saw The Godfather at age 14 , I thought it was boring . 20 years later , its an incredible movie to me . In other words , I grew up and began to appreciate great movies . So I rented Dirty Dancing with my girlfriend last night on her request , as she loved it at age 14 and I hated it at the same age . But I hoped , because I was young and unintelligent at age 14 , perhaps this would be a new experience for me . So I sat down with her to watch , hoping to be enlightened . Well , the night after watching Dirty Dancing , I feel a violation . I feel like someone reached into my soul and robbed me of 2 hours of my life from watching this cheeseflower fest . First , Patrick Swayze plays a 20 year old , but he looks like he is 35 . And the premise of the movie is him seducing some underage teenager , wooing her with his dance moves . Really Creepy . Anyway , the movie is the cliché plot where the " wrong side of the tracks " guy and the " rich smart girl " accidentally fall in love with each other . Of course , their romance is fueled by the fact the " rich girl " ca n't dance a lick , so the " inadequate hero " teaches her in a week to become an expert dancer for the big end of vacation show , or something like that . But you guessed it : The disapproving father soon enters and forbids the two to see each other , and the movie progresses to secret meetings of dance lessons and love making . This all culminates into the final scene where the entire resort rallies around the two young lovers while the once antagonistic father accepts the 35 year old dancer as his teen daughter 's new man . Even my girlfriend whimpered at the end of the movie as she admitted it was not anything like she remembered . I did n't press her , but I did smirk a little , and put the Godfather part II in the DVD player . sub_rate: 0.007159904534606206; NE_rate: 0.0

This movie is a great movie ONLY if you need something to sit and laugh at the stupidity of it. As a geologist this movie gets most of the important facts wrong and uses actors that are too young to even be considered in the top of their fields. It is interesting how it shows spurting lava in massive caverns below the Earth's surface. It also is funny how seismically active areas are shown to have massive destruction from a 6.5 magnitude earthquake. They seem to forget the building standards in these areas would be higher needing a bigger quake to do this much damage. Also it is funny how much they make the coast line of Washington State and also Oregon to look as though they are nice beaches of Southern California. The Jelly donut analogy is very entertaining even if the way it is used is wrong. The director does a good job of adding more comic relief with the 2 "supossed" PhD's. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
The French either make pro - Marxist films or anti - Marxist films - with a few in between . " Merci pour le chocolat " is the latter of this genre . From the opening credits telling the viewer what music is going to be played and by whom it was who composed you know that you are going to be swathed in middle class pretension . It is an honest man 's film with an excess of 40 's plus people . It is also directed by an honest man along with an honest crew who have nothing to say about life to the viewer . The game is not only banal but preposterous . How many films reveal the game through dialogue only to repeat the same message via flashback some five minutes later ? Maybe the director and actors had a humble retentive capacity ? In truth their is no tenable game at all . It is riddle with holes like a good piece of French cheeseflower . Whether intentional or not , it is a film about the bourgeoisie . At least a third of the film focuses on the piano and the ostentatious twaddle espoused in each scene . I concede it has some well framed shots though they could n't have used a steady - cam in this film - it would have woke them all up ! Other than it being a trumpery story , the film allows the upper middle class to parade their values and vanity in a very comfortable Swiss location . A telling line of the film is when Rodolphe Pauly tells Anna Mouglalis that she need not lock her car while in the resort ! Oh dear me . On the DVD , Miss Huppert makes a comment about shedding a false tear for a scene . Smirking she says : " Like they do in the American Actor 's Studio ! " I think Miss Huppert and the rest of the cast could learn well from the Actor 's Studio . If there is one statement that stand out in my mind it is when India remarks ' we are having friends for the weekend and all the servants are away ' . No doubt they had all escaped from the mind numbing set lest they be associated with such an appalling motion . Ford Medical Note .

This depiction hit the movie screens on June 6th 1980 , starring Stephen Macht as Sergeant Thor , Avery Schreiber as Captain Comelius Butt , J.D. Hinton as Buzz and starring Playmate of the year Dorothy Stratton . The picture starts with the police infinity roaming space looking for I guess criminals . There ship is suddenly attacked by an unknown space ship . Enters Sergeant Thor and his partner Buzz as they try to figure out who the unknown ship belongs to . When failing they call on Captain Comelius who instructs his crew to fight back . Enters the gorgeous Dorothy Stratton , who plays the role of Galaxina who is man made robot . An now a few thoughts on this picture . This picture was plan unintelligent and it 's one of the reasons that I do n't get into Sci - Fi . If you 're into Sci - Fi you would have notice that the laser sound effects were borrowed from an early Sci - fi movie titled Battlestar Galactica which aired in theaters in 1978 . Many of the door sounds that you hear in this movie came from another Sci - Fi movie that aired back in 1966 titled Star Trek . Now for the reason that I bought this movie , Dorothy Stratton . She is gorgeous in her one piece suit . I think her talents were wasted in this picture and she should have never been involved in such garbage . Connie Sellecca was also considered for the role and her talents would have been wasted also . On the picture alone I give this movie 1 weasel star and on Dorothy Stratton I give her 10 weasel stars even though she did n't deserve to be put into a ice movie like this .

The show is a complete copy of many US Chat Shows - Leno , Letterman , Conan O Brian , the list goes on - but he and his team have clearly seen what works on the masses can also be done for the dumb masses in the UK also . The unfortunate situation - he has no competition ? Parkinson has gone by the reality is he was never really up to much except grooming a celebs ego . Ca n't we have someone funnier and slicker on British Screens instead of Jonathan Ross ? Once Ross has built up his ego enough he will then proceed to the very irksome concept of the stiff celebrities in the green room - so trying to get on with each other . If an A - Lister is present ( which is so often the case these days - as there are no other chat shows they can turn to - to promote their latest movie ) - he will spend the next hour either flirting with them or trying to be their best friend in the Universe . Sqeamish when he had Ringo Starr on - a man that cares nothing for licking arse - Ross genuinely was begging for his mobile phone number ( as common policy on this show is for Jonathan Ross to get everyones number so he can be seen in the right company when not working ) . Of course Ringo said it how it is - and simply said no I do n't like you - dead pan serious . Ross needs to be axed from all Awards and TV shows - the masses will get over it . sub_rate: 0.0027548209366391185; NE_rate: 0.0
The movie starts out with its most intelligent joke , and goes downhill from there ( pun intended ) . After that there 's lots of potty humor and sexual situations . The beautiful women were the best part of the movie . Swear - word puns are not meant to be central idea jokes , but they try it here . The battle between the two groups in the local town ( richies and poories ) is an old tried and true setup , so how could it go wrong ? Well , there is no reason to envy the " richies " nor any reason to feel sorry for the poories , so we can forget the central plot . The situational humor is all throne or sexual aimed at teenagers , but only garners giggles , no true belly - laughs . The only thing that salvages the comedy for this movie is the quality humor , with the blind man providing some rehashed , but seldom used setups , and the black bar owner providing the formulaic " street " or " hood " humor . OK , forget the jokes , there has to be some killer snowboarding shots since this was a commercial enterprise . Unfortunately , there was only 4 seconds of backdrop action that might be inspiring . The rest was all " B " grade tricks or worse . The big moment , where the main character rides " the goat " , a man - killer ski run , did provide one shot where a small avalanche eats the stuntman . This was the best of the boarding in this movie . Any serious snowboarding fan will be disappointed with the quality of the stunts in the movie . As for the technical aspects of the movie , the soundtrack was fair , which surprises , as those snowboarding documentaries are regularly filled with quality tunes . You can catch a lot of redaction mistakes and even though it was shot on a ski mountain , the majority of " scenery " shots failed to convey any sense of true size . Overall , it MIGHT be worth watching if you have managed to turn your brain completely off and you like silicon breasts . Even then , you wo nt remember a thing from this one two days later . Snowboarding is still waiting for it 's definitive comedy , you 'd do better to watch a snowboarding documentary for sure . sub_rate: 0.009456264775413711; NE_rate: 0.0
This movie is honestly one of the greatest movies of all time...if you suffer from insomnia. It is a fool-proof way to guarantee hours of sleep at a time. As the movie slowly progresses, the audience slips into a state of unconsciousness and gradually loses sight of any sort of plot that the movie might actually contain. This effect is surely created due to the lack of sweet action/sweet babes.Also, Mr. Eisenstein was obviously unable to master the art of montage. A prime example of this is the scene on the Odessa steps. For no apparent reason, an event that in real life would have taken a matter of seconds is transformed into a seven minute nightmare for any sane viewer. This editing flaw tarnishes any sort of realism in the entire film. Honestly, i've seen more realistic editing watching cartoons.Some individuals who have commented on this title have hailed Battleship Potemkin as: "One of the greatest movies of all time" and, "Truly a masterpiece". Well i'm writing this comment to persuade readers to avoid watching this film at all costs. My best guess is that my fellow Potemkin critics simply wrote the wrong words in their summaries. Surely what they meant to say was: "One of the greatest snooze-fests of all time" and, "Truly an epic fail".In conclusion, don't waste your time. If you are interested in watching a movie of far superior quality, go to www.youtube.com and watch a Halo 3 montage. If i played the movie "Battleship Potemkin" in a game of slayer on guardian, i would shoot it in the face with my sniper rifle and then teabag its dead body. PEACE! sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0

Well Folks , this is another stereotypic portrayla of Gay lifetime however , the additional downside includes poor acting , ugly book , no budget , tremendous sound and let us not forget the impossible storyline . It is Christmas in New York City and our story immediatly " focuses " on two male individuals , apparently lovers for some time . One of them has not let his parents ( the right wing , religious zealot types ) know that he is gay ( adding to the impluasability of the story 'cause this guy is as efeminant as gay guys come these days ) and his parents are coming to viusit him . They will stay in his New York apartment where he and his lover have just decorated for Christmas . The story continues to develop around the arrival of the parents , who noone will like anyway and - how through only obvious and predictable ways - they come to learn there son is gay . Tears are shed as was my sake in this movie . The cast of charecters , seemed like an intro acting course at the local community theatre . The lovers in this film are mismatched , and there does not appear to be any cohesion to their union . The landlord is flat and her attempt to be humanistic in the situation are undercooked and certainly did nt help move the game any further . The dragqueen friend who steps to the aid of one of the lovers in his " time of need " is stereotypic and gives a tough name to the unique art of drag . Although some guys night find one of the lovers to make a nice body ( again , stereotypic imagery ) it does not help this story . ride away from this film , especially if you are considering a purchase . You 'll shoot yourself if you do ! sub_rate: 0.027522935779816515; NE_rate: 0.0
If there 's one word I can associate to this movie , its ' superfluity ' . It must be embarrassing to everyone associated with the movie , to actually watch it in a theatre . Everything - the book , screenplay , dialogues , song lyrics , direction - shoddy , filthy . Saw this movie when I was a kid . Liked it then , mainly because it was a fantasy , a superhero - movie . Its a not - so - explored genre in Hindi cinema . The attempt deserves credit , but that 's all there is to it . Sashi Kapoor seems to have been in a great hurry in making the movie . Ca n't understand the reason behind casting foreigners as Hindi - speaking characters , who ca n't even get the sync right ( nothing to say about the dubbing ) . The screenplay is tremendous . The editing even more . If one follows the dialogues closely , one can detect grammatically - wrong sentences ( which completely alter the intended meaning ) . Nothing special about the music . The biggest superfluity must be for the Censor board . There are a couple of nip - slip scenes in the movie , one of which is absolutely clean ( so much so that I ca n't even think of a metaphor ) . The director missed them . The editing team missed it . And the censor board missed it too . So much for the no - indecent - exposure - on screen motto . The officials probably fell asleep while watching the movie . Ca n't think of why Amitabh went with the role . It might be because he was a good friend of the Kapoors . But the role hardly has anything for him . With wonderful roles in Hum and Agneepath behind him , he could n't have followed it up with a worse one . There are a couple of heroic scenes , really worthy ones . But otherwise , they 're embarrassingly unbelievable ( arrow - catching for instance .. it probably could ' ve been better with CGI , but it was ' 91 .. ) .Dimple and Sonam do not exactly set the screen on fire . Shammi Kapoor and Rishi Kapoor give an inspired performance , but their scope is limited . Amrish Puri is his usual self in the role of a fairy - tale villain ( letting out the villainous laugh every now and then).On the whole , an interesting concept . Could have been a lot more better . sub_rate: 0.013636363636363636; NE_rate: 0.0
Soultaker was written by and starred Vivian Schilling . It also starred Joe Estevez , Gregg Thomsen , and Robert D'Zar as the Angel of Death . The story begins with introduction to Soultaker , played by Joe Estevez . We quickly learn what Soultaker 's role will be in this movie . Next the college aged young people are getting ready for a summer festival , aptly named " Summerfest " . In this film , the battle of the classes is omni - present throughout the film . The girls come from a wealthy class , and the guys come from roughly middle or lower class . The class roles seem to play a role in the film for some reason which is n't really clear or pertinent to the story . At Summerfest we learn more about the apparent class struggles of why Zach is n't encouraged to date Natalie . Soultaker makes an appearance as well , with apparently his boss the Angel of Death . Here D'Zar 's character points out who is to die and who 's souls are to be taken . It 's revealed as well , that Soultaker will have a character conflict regarding Natalie , and how he deals with her because of someone in his past . Meanwhile Natalie is ditched by her ride to Summerfest , and Zach convinces her to ride home with them . During the ride home , Soultaker takes an active role causing them to wreck horribly at high speeds . The rest of the story surrounds the Soultaker collecting the souls of the dead passengers , and Zach and Natalie trying to outwit him to return to their bodies so they can continue to live . The class and character conflicts lay in the story , but are really never brought to the forefront or resolved . There 's an attempt towards the end to drag out some of the drama , there 's a lot of chasing and running which does tend to be really boring . It 's not really acceptable , and it would 've been nice had this been dealt with differently , somehow to maybe increase the drama but not bore the audience . The story and acting are nice . The soundtrack is OK , and even the production values are good . Robert D'Zar in his brief on screen appearances does a nice job as the Angel of Death . Joe Estevez does OK , however sometimes his role acting a bit flat . Vivian is pretty and does a decent job as Natalie , although perhaps over acting a bit in a few scenes . This may sound odd , but this movie definitely could 've benefited from some pointless nudity . Vivian teases us a bit but that was n't enough . In my opinion this was a pretty serious attempt at making a movie . The results , it 's worth watching . Just do n't expect a perfect production.3/10 sub_rate: 0.0019723865877712033; NE_rate: 0.0
This motion had all the ingredients of a good adventure motion , but it revealed incompetence at almost every spirit . The presence of Roger Moore in the cast list is usually a sign that the picture is not going to be anything more than middling , because Moore always has lead roles and he ca n't act . But this movie also had Ian Holm and Lee Marvin in it , and was based on a Wilbur Julia book , so I thought I 'd give it a fortune when I saw the DVD for sale in the bargain bin ... It was a misapprehension . The opening scene appeared to start in the middle of a spool , with speech suddenly appearing as if the first second of the soundtrack had been truncated . The scene showed a dreadnought at sea with a German crew . This tough editing was a sign of things to occur , but the scene with the dreadnought was interesting enough to keep me watching . The exceptional effects were good , and the crew wore the proper uniforms and spoke in German , indicating that the music at least paid attention to historical point . I was surprised . So I kept watching , and then Moore appeared and my supicions were confirmed . Bad playacting , clichéd lines , clichéd cinematography and tatty sense ... but worst of all , there is a disastrous attack to blend the light - hearted tone of the film with good drama and tragedy . It just does not figure . The picture ends as suddenly and as disadvantageously as it started  in the middle of a spool . sub_rate: 0.08771929824561403; NE_rate: 0.0
Saw the film at it 's Lawrence , Kansas premiere . This wavering story about a group of disgruntled highschoolers killing off the competition for prom queen was merely amazing . It fails for many reasons - bad playacting , bad hand , no clear point . But mainly it just felt like the filmmakers said to themselves - " Hey I have some money , so let 's make a movie ! " - without really thinking it out . Sorrowfully most indie films that do n't make it suffer from just that mentality . They just do n't seem to realize that it takes more than money to make a good movie ... or in this showcase , still a watchable one . With this film I do not feel ashamed to say , that if I did n't know some of the crew , I would have walked out . Simple as that . sub_rate: 0.03821656050955414; NE_rate: 0.0
Legend has it that at the gala Hollywood premiere screening of 2001 : A Space Odyssey , about 20 minutes into the film Rock Hudson yelled out " Would somebody please tell me what the hell this movie is about ? " Well , I have Rock beaten by about 19 minutes , 59 seconds . This movie made perfectly no sense at all . Who were those people ? Where were those people ? What were the rules of the game called Quintet ? Are there any rules to Quintet ? Were Robert Altman and his cohorts making the movie up as they went along ? What was Paul Newman thinking when he signed on to this ? Maybe ol' Fast Eddie saw Zardoz and thought " Well if Connery can get involved in a futuristic film that makes no sense , so can I. " Maybe the good stuff is on the cutting room floor and all we get to see is the incoherent stuff . Also , did all the cast get to keep their individual funny hats ? You never saw such bizarre looking hats all in one place in your life .

This is maybe the worst thing I ' ve ever seen on television . First , I fairly m pretty sure it only itself entirely gravely , and I tend fairly honest pretty good at recognizing satire .

Asmali Konak has arguably become one of the best TV series to come out of Turkey . With its unique cinematography and visual approach to filming , the series has gained a wide following base with rating records continuously broken . Personally I do not agree with singers becoming actors ( hence , Ozcan Deniz - the lead actor ) but I guess the figures speak for themselves . In relation to the movie , it was skanky to see how much someone can destroy such a plotline . Years in the making , this movie was able to oversee every descent story that existed within the series . Not only that , the cultural mistakes were unacceptable , with an preposterous scene involving the family members dancing ( Greek style ) and breaking plates , which does not exists anywhere within the Turkish culture . Some argue the movie should be taken as a stand alone movie not as a continuation of the TV series but this theory has one major fall , the way the movie was marketed was that it will be picking up where the series left off and will conclude the series once and for all . So with that note in mind , me and everyone I know , would have asked for a refund and accepted to stand outside the theatre to warn other victims . sub_rate: 0.008583690987124463; NE_rate: 0.0
The record is great . It 's one of my favourite books ever . The film , on the other hand , is amazingly insipid and tough ! When I heard Damon would play Ripley , I knew this yield was doomed . But I did n't expect it to be this tough . The actors go around and represent very showy . Except for Law ( and even he is guilty of some showy acting ) , all the actors here are near inexpert . Speaking Italian and moving one 's arms or hair about should n't be considered as acting . Damon is miscast . He 's way also strong for a quality that 's supposed to be a chameleon . David is forgettable and Hoffman plays yet another effeminate slimy quality . Talk about typecasting . What 's really unforgivable about the book ( written by the overrated director ) is that it wholly forgoes every subtle details from the book and comes up with many of its own , and none of them work ! The addition of the Jazz music stuff is wholly faulty ! I guess Minghella 's theme of Italy in the late 50s , early 60s is clouded with images of Chet Baker roaming the Italian countryside and spreading amore . Yep , Minghella is a honest visionary . The picture is thus bleeding obvious . That silly scene when Ripley drives through the narrow street full of mirrors . really amusing . Yes , we get the point ! ! ! Every point or detail comes across a 70 mm away , so very so that the film might give the audience the false impression that they have psychic powers . We know , for example , that the Blanchett character , introduced at the beginning of the movie , will deliver later on only complicate things . And the soundtrack , at times , is wholly incompatible . Whimsical when it should n't be . The film goes on for also long and in all sorts of superfluous directions . There exist also many irksome characters populating the landscape ( many that were n't in the book ) . This picture is bad ! actually bad!Apparently , Minghella 's son told his father that the Ripley novel was his favourite . Mr. Minghella then proceeded to direct it as a favor of sorts to his son . Well , the director did achieve what he set out to do : Talented Mr. Ripley , with its Hitchcock aspirations , is a film strictly made for 12 year olds ! sub_rate: 0.07990867579908675; NE_rate: 0.02857142857142857
I ca n't help thinking that this is Franco 's ' hamage ' to the Marquis de Sade 's " One Thousand Days of Sodom " . People ( in this case women ) abducted to serve as slaves to a privileged elite ? Check . Kinky sex ? Check . Torture including whipping ? Check . Victims chosen at random to be killed ? Check . Thank goodness Franco did n't go the whole hog and introduce cinema audiences to the delights of coprology ( and indeed coprophagy ) , another perversion that crops up repeatedly in de Sade 's tediously long and disgusting saga . I rather hoped that this film would fall into the ' so high it 's good ' category . But even the acres of naked flesh and numerous sexual encounters did n't make up for the dismal negotiation , unspeakable acting , elusive plot and - just to put the tin hat on it - dubbing AND English sub - titles ( a belt and braces approach missing from the women 's costumes ) . The Alsation gave a very professional performance though . Of course I could be wrong about the de Sade angle . After all , I failed to realise that the actor playing the head warden at the ' prison ' was a trans - sexual . I must pay more attention to the size of people 's hands in future . According to another reviewer , the film was banned in the UK . Well it clearly is n't any more , though I fancy that the nipple - needling scene was cut to satisfy the censors . On the DVD I watched , it was only clearly visible on the Spanish trailer ( which , in case you 're wondering , I watched to compare it with the English one).The DVD also features an interview with Jess Franco , though you 'll need better Spanish than mine to understand it . Unless I ' m much mistaken it 's neither dubbed nor sub - titled . And it points out that the person sodomising the character played by Franco is Ajita Wilson disguised using a moustache . Kind of ironic , given that ( s)he had had the requisite appendage surgically removed . sub_rate: 0.007792207792207792; NE_rate: 0.0

great spoiler right here : this film is B!A!D ! But enjoy , it 's good bad . Bugged is the kind of film you ca n't believe exists , with dialog , plotting , and direction so ineptly handled that Uncle Ned 's Carlsbad Cavern home video looks like an IMAX experience . Since it 's a Troma flick , there 's plenty of gross - out gore on tap , but its even sillier than usual . Most of the production money seems to have gone into buying soda and sandwiches for cast and crew . The brilliant dialog is best summed up in the immortal , " % @#$ ! What was that ? " which is second only to the oft screamed , " Now what?"Any knowledge of how people act in a desperate situation is alien to Ronald Armstrong , the writer / director . When one of the friends is found being eaten alive by a grasshopper / termite / chiapet thing , Armstrong has the survivors immediately making time with cute , but dumb - as - a - doorknob , " Divine . " While she 's being hit on , Divine is cooking up a big steaming pot of a rat - poison / oatmeal mixture on the stove , stirring , smiling , stirring , smiling , never falling over dead from the fumes!The killer bugs are as frightening as piñatas , which they too closely resemble . The effects used to move them include dragging them across tile floors real fast with their legs dragging behind . The highlight for the film would probably have been the house blowing up , but they were either out of cash or never had any , so instead of seeing even a miniature go up in flames , they simply let the screen go black ( eat you heart out ILM).The cast is well all black . How can the NAACP consistently censor something truly funny like Amos and Andy ( which depicts characters certainly no less similiar than those on 99 % of all white comedy shows ) , but says nary a peep about something like Bugged . Oh well , it 's best they do n't know about how demeaning this film is to all involved ( as it would be if it were played by any single ethnic group , frankly ) . Before they put the kabosh on Bugged , get some friends together and get ready for the Plan 9 of Bug Exterminator movies . sub_rate: 0.004662004662004662; NE_rate: 0.0
When you get ahead of a film , you know you are wasting your time watching the movie in question . That is exactly how I felt while I was watching " Darkness . " I could see anticipate every twist and turn easily . It is a combination of " The Amityville Horror " and a myriad of films that deal with the occult . It is thus whacky that I almost found endearing its naiveness . I can not say I was wholly bored but I found the film way too derivative for my taste . Director Balagueró tries to redo his early Spanish hit " The Nameless , " but he can not pull it off . I admit , a few sequences were creepy enough but I just abhor when I can figure out what is going to happen next . Also , I hated to see good actors like Lena Olin and Giancarlo Giannini sweat so much over this piece of dreck . Finally , Anna Paquin as the star of a horror film ? This must be a joke .

This picture strayed also far from Straub 's novel for me to enjoy . Barely made it to the middle of the film . Besides changing Don Wanderly from Edwards nephew into his son , the removed most of the major scenes and a number of characters that gave the novel so much life . What was left was glass . Straub 's version was far superior to this poorly executed film . I do n't think casting did all that great a job on picking the Chowder Society members either . Hopefully someone will come along and actually remake this film correctly in my lifetime .

Let Freedom Ring was probably made with the best of intentions, but it sends out a curious mixed message in the final product.The folks at a western town where the railroad is coming through are overwhelmed by the arrival of immigrant railroad workers, working on the railroad being financed by robber baron Edward Arnold. There are a few ranchers and farmers whose land stands in the railroad's path and these folks are dealt with summarily by Arnold's hired men. One man who won't give in is Lionel Barrymore whose son is coming home from Harvard a lawyer and ready to take up the rancher's cause.Only Nelson Eddy decides the best way to fight is to go Zorro on the bad guys. But other than Charles Butterworth no one knows he's the Wasp (a very interesting choice of names by the way). What Arnold's done is used the tried and true methods of the political bosses of the east, getting the immigrants to vote. Nelson's idea is simple, if the immigrants only knew the truth about what a bad guy Arnold is, they'll vote with the original settlers and knock out the alien urban political machine in their midst. He kidnaps newspaper editor Raymond Walburn and takes him and the press to a mountain cave where some subversive newspapers are printed and distributed.The railroad workers are a real mixed bunch of immigrants, not the Irish working west or the Chinese working east as history has it. It's a real United Nations working on Arnold's railroad. The workers are kept in line by foreman Victor McLaglen and Nelson has the unenviable task of beating some sense into him like John Wayne did in The Quiet Man.Of all the films that starred Jeanette and Nelson and they certainly have come down in history as a duo, this was the worst of what they did at MGM. Nelson is about to be hanged along with Barrymore for crimes that are undefined at best, but certainly nothing worth being hung for. And Virginia Bruce who plays the Nelson's girlfriend saves the day with a rendition of My Country Tis of Thee that the immigrants join in with. In the face of a revolt by his paid for immigrant voters, Arnold quite rationally packs up and leaves town to build his railroad somewhere else.I kid you not, that's the ending here. Just what is the message, vote with the settlers and lose your jobs with Arnold? But somehow you'll get by here? I do wonder some times if 20 years from after the incidents of this film take place and the town as settled into a sleepy backwater of the west while some towns where the railroad has come through that are now cities, that the good citizens of that town haven't rethought about what Nelson Eddy did. If they did they're probably running him out on a rail.Nelson is of course in good voice and has a variety of concert and popular pieces to sing including a ballad to the immigrants written by Sigmund Romberg, Where Else But Here. The song is a heartfelt tribute from an immigrant who did make good in his adopted country. Too bad it didn't have a better venue.The almost platinum blonde Virginia Bruce I'm sure is dubbed here. And I'm sure Jeanette MacDonald was just as happy she wasn't accompanying Nelson on this trip west. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0

"A bored television director is introduced to the black arts and astral projection by his girlfriend. Learning the ability to separate his spirit from his body, the man finds a renewed interest in his life and a sense of wellbeing. Unfortunately, the man discovers while he is sleeping, his spirit leaves his body and his uncontrolled body roams the streets in a murderous rampage," according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis.The synopsis isn't entirely correct, as it turns out.Anyway, the movie opens with a dizzying "out-of-body" example of handsome director Winston Rekert (as Paul Sharpe)'s newly discovered "astral body" experience; it also foreshadows an upcoming dogfight. Young Andrew Bednarski (as Matthew Sharpe), being a kid, draws pictures of "The Blue Man", as his murder spree begins. Handsome detective John Novak (as Stewart Kaufman) discovers the victims are connected to Mr. Rekert. Mr. Novak's investigation leads to the supernatural; a prime example of which is Karen Black (as Janus), with whom Rekert fears he is falling in love.Several in the cast perform well; but, "The Blue Man" winds up tying itself up in a knot. Aka "Eternal Evil", its unsatisfying story tries to be far too clever for its own good. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
This movie is like so many biopic TV movies I have seen: formulaic, exaggerating, poorly acted, and most importantly, happening too soon.What I mean by that is the movie was filmed and, for that matter, aired before Michael Jackson's acquittal from his child molestation charges, which I think was one of the most significant periods of Jackson's life and career so far. It probably would have made a great ending to this docu-drama. However, this movie already bites off more than it can chew, cramming too many details in this overly ambitious project.It's no doubt that Michael Jackson has led perhaps the most interesting life so far of any musician, let alone modern day pop star, to date, and his story would probably take six Behind The Music specials to tell accurately. This movie tried to tell too much in three hours, and needless to say, it failed.Flex Alexander did what he could in playing Jackson, but he came off more like an SNL caricature by the likes of Tim Meadows and Amy Poehler. It would admittedly be pretty hard to find someone who accurately portrays Jackson without meeting with the King of Pop himself and studying his methods of madness. On a shoestring budget, though, one can only depend on what they see in the tabloids, and those do not necessarily give an accurate representation.Furthermore, the director's efforts to make Alexander look like Jackson are completely foolish. The Caucasian makeup on Alexander's face makes him look more like a reverse minstrel show, and everyone who has been in a grocery store knows that Jackson's nose is not as big as Alexander's. It's also amazing to me that the film documents Jackson going under the knife to get cosmetic surgery, yet in the next scene, Alexander still has the same size nose. This kind of suspension of disbelief that the director expects can't hold up to TV viewers in the 21st century.It was even more distracting when footage of the real Michael Jackson (i.e. the time he hung his infant child over a balcony in Germany) was interspersed into the movie in real time. It was a nice try, but it just didn't work.If this movie as it is was released into theaters, it would gain a profit only because of its tackiness. It even pales in comparison to "Mommie Dearest", and that's saying a lot. Above all, this was a movie that was probably rushed into making, like many TV movies that aren't on HBO. It could have been done a lot better if it had just told of one aspect of Jackson's life. Even if it just covered the child molestation allegations, it probably would have been done a lot better and would have even been more intriguing. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
holmium hum . Rich good looking kid gets in trouble , poor girl falls in love with him , jealous ex - boyfriend causes tension .. yadda yadda . I actually laughed out loud in many parts of this picture because the next view was indeed predictable and hardly apparently unintelligent . As one scenery moved on to the next , I often found myself wondering just how we got there , like I had skipped a few chapters in a book . The book was pretty pitiful and did n't have me or my wife caring much about any of the characters , except the jilted boyfriend . Now , if the ex boyfriend had gotten an axe , and hacked apart the girl and rich kid , then .... then we would have a movie , and all the stupid dialog and leaps in game could be acceptable . But , since this motion attempts to be touching and wholly misses the boat ( and ends up resorting to the romance equivalent of divine intervention to try and jerk a tear ) ... it just falls very really monotonous . keep this movie .

In trying to keep up with the hipness of youthful audiences as the 70s approached, OaCD,YCSF was the product of odder and odder material selected for musicalization. Here it's past life regression, ESP and hypno-therapy... pretty loopy! The real problem with the concept (music or not) are the extraordinarily low dramatic stakes; just where can a movie go, and what can happen, when a man falls in love with a previous incarnation of a girl he can't stand? It can't go any place new, but strangely, it can't even go any place old! Indeed, if it could, audiences would still have no interest in the union of Yves Montand (playing a much older, arrogant, French ass) and Streisand. (a much younger girl). We never become invested in them, their situations or outcomes. Montand is miscast and his strong accent makes many of his lyrics unintelligible.It's all been given a shallow 60s veneer that makes it eminently disposable; despite efforts here and there from Minelli that are respectable. It's not even adapted from a non-musical story that met with any previous success... that's just too passe! Streisand occasionally has some funny business to offer, as when she's trying not to fall asleep on her roof and improvises an energetic dance. But she over-relies on her ingratiating (translation: irritating) kooky, Jewish girl shtick. She can however sing very well, at both the "gentle" and "powerhouse" ends of the range. Amidst a score of musical dross, she gets 3 or 4 amazing songs* of much higher caliber than anything Fanny or Dolly had to offer. 'He isn't you' is a sweet trifle as sublime as Lorenz Hart's 'My Funny Valentine,' but the movie isn't able to realize any impact from it; because the lyrics don't seem to be referring to anything in the movie, and nothing remotely suggests a great love is blossoming between Chabot and Melinda.The only cut we can view is a poor hatchet job of a much bigger film. Strong research shows a longer, better-explained and more decorative, but not necessarily a better film at: http://barbra-archives.com/films/clear_day_streisand_2.html. You can be sure there's be more Babs in that version but more importantly, there'd be more thoughtful work from Minelli.In the end Montand sends Babs off to sing the title song, after she discovers he's a total dick who feeds her a self-esteem homily to allow himself off the hook. And she takes the bait. So, uh... hooray for that.(*Hurry it's lovely up here, Love with all the trimmings, He isn't you, & the title song) sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
Surrender Cinema has been known for their extremely erotic, almost explicit sci-fi films. While they generally do very well at these (Femalien 1 & 2, Virtual Encounters), this particular entry seems to be just a rehash of old tape. Any number of girls -- some recognizable and others not -- are in this film in all stages of nudity. There are also several clips from other films which are outstanding, unless you've seen those other films. There are a number of solo nude scenes doing a number of things -- some playing basketball, others talking, still others playing with themselves. The only thing of value in this tape is the very last scene -- a short but erotic girl-girl scene with a very enthusiastic and enjoyable Sandy Wasko and a more subdued Tammie Hainum. Not highly recommended. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0

The only thing more full of holes than this movie 's premise is its script . Flatliners is the ideal showcase for Joel Schumacher 's glorious , flamboyant , brazen lack of talent . The plot is totally unconnected but super fake - ponderous and everything is art - directed within an inch of its life in the most clichéd , overheated way . I love how the med school autopsy room is a cavernous vaulted marble mausoleum low - lit in red with huge Rembrandt paintings hanging from the walls . I love how Keifer Sutherland drives a canvas - backed army jeep . No one in Joel Schumacher 's movies lives in an un - eccentric manner . It 's always an alternate universe where everyone is young and painfully hip , but hip strictly and obsessively according to an out - of - touch middle - aged billionaire man - child 's idea of hip . And holy crap ! The part where Baldwin brother # 16 dies and comes back to life and then is haunted by all the women he 's slept with who intone " I 'll call you " and " I just need some space " is the funniest friggin ' thing in the whole universe ! ! ! !

Greetings All , Isn't it amazing the power that films have on you after the 1st viewing ? I was so delighted by the first viewing of this film , I could n't stop talking about " Flatliners " to all my friends for weeks - mind you I was a very impressionable 18 year old back then and my taste in films have become a little more conservative since then . Then somehow I forgot about this film until I saw the DVD in my local department store and remembering how great it was I thought " Right ! I 'll pluck you off the shelf when they bring out the Special Edition" . Last week , I was overjoyed when my best friend invited me over to watch Flatliners on DVD . The expectation was that I would love this film even more on 2nd viewing .. How wrong I was ! Verdict : after 11 years my view on this film had changed from a very scary 1st class movie to total junk which overplays on the religious and supernatural side of things ratherly superficially . I have never been a big fan of Julia Roberts ' acting ( excepting for Erin Brockeridge in which she deserved her Oscar ) I think the problem with this film definitely lies with the director and a so so fair script . I left this film feeling it had no real substance or potential , and just a couple of scarey cheap thrills which were n't very well done at all . Not even the score by James - Newtown Howard , who I rather like as a film composer , could captivate and thrill me . In 1990 I would have given this film 9.5 / 10 ; but in 2001 I 'd be lucky to give it 2 / 10 at best . sub_rate: 0.0031746031746031746; NE_rate: 0.0
Usually when a television biopic is released on a celebrity , its , at the very least , campy ( i.e. Cybill Shepherd as Martha Stewart , Lauren BaCall as Doris Duke ) , this is the most frightening , tatty , and drilling television movie ever made . If VH-1 is going to make a television film , they have GOT to spend a little more money on them . Flex Alexander -- though gifted with the Michael voice -- is not a great dancer , does not resemble Michael one bit , and does not even have his mannerisms down . VH-1 would have done better by hiring an actual impersonator , that way when see Michael go into get plastic surgery , he does n't actually come out looking EXACTLY the same . Why should we be taken aback at the shrinking of Michael 's nose when its exactly the same size as in the beginning of the film ? The woman playing Elizabeth Taylor can not act and looks nothing like her , and do n't even get me started on the woman as Janet Jackson . tremendous script and a grievous case of miscasting needs to keep VH-1 from producing any more movies . Flex Alexander would have made a much better JERMAINE JACKSON rather than Michael . Costumes ? Trashy ripoffs . Neverland ? Spliced together footage from news docs . Do n't bother with this one .... its not even remotely worth it . The one good piece of casting -- the actor portraying Joseph Jackson and MAYBE the actress as Lisa Marie Presley , though she should have been more tomboy than girlie girl . sub_rate: 0.0176678445229682; NE_rate: 0.0
This is so high I do n't know where to begin . The lead role is a good starting point . It is a supreme Mary Sue character that has few things in common with the original one from the book , who was ( a bit ) more credible . No , this one is invincible , infallible , indomitable , and insipid even beyond the overinflated standards that this " chicks with swords " era that our medias are spinning out of late . She is a twenty - something top - model , thin as a match yet rich , already a leader in her academic field , a kung - fu master , a natural sniper and seems to have enough authority to naturally trump anyone official like puny FBI agents . She is God . To balance it out , she is supposed to be socially awkward ( due to her typically harsh upbringing that transformed her into a " Spock " ) which gives us some delighted moments where she wonders what is " Star Wars " , or " American Idol " , but yet when it 's really important she can conveniently reveal herself as a top negotiator and diplomat , because she is so superior , ya know . To top it out , she is played by a wooden actress . The more talented Boreanaz serves as a faire - valoir token for this construct , acting as a bumbling comic - relief and house " Watson " . In fact , everything in there is a pop - parody of better works like Sherlock Holmes , CSI and X - Files , from which it tries to emulate the sexual tension between main protagonists . It is however cheaper , as this is delivered with all the subtlety of an elbow poke in the ribs , but a million million poor factory girls will doubtlessly buy into it , hence the crazy rating this turkey gets . In fact , the lowest common denominator goes a long way in this sad puppy , resulting in titillating sex details from the legion of sidekicks that aim to pass it out as daring and trendy , while the overall tone of the show carries an obvious neo - conservative view on things . Story - wise , there 's not much here to feast upon , as crimes ( that always start out with some gruesome remains ) are resolved using non - existent technology while the " squints " , lovable but so wrong ( the women less than the guys ) goes on varied theories , all of them futile as the main character has it all from the start , and once it is established she goes out and then punch the guy , typically a real tough hombre , with a spin kick here and a slapper there .

You Belong To Me was the final teaming of Henry Fonda and Barbara Stanwyck as a screen team and it was a loan out film for Fonda to Columbia Pictures . Fonda had signed a contract with 20th Century Fox in order to get the Tom Joad part in The Grapes of Wrath . But after that it was usually his loan out films that were good while he was cast in fair things at Fox . But the rule was broken here . Though the character he plays bears some superficial resemblance to Charles Pike from The Lady Eve , this film is n't anywhere near as funny . In fact feminists would probably be aghast at it . In fact Barbara Stanwyck herself did n't like it at all . She liked working with Henry Fonda right enough , but thought this film was ridiculous . As well she should have . Fonda is another millionaire playboy , who we would now call a trust fund baby who does n't really do much with his life . He 's sort of lovable lunkhead who meets Stanwyck on a ski slope and literally falls for her trying to show off . Turns out she 's a doctor and they have a whirlwind courtship and get married . But it turns out Fonda has a jealous streak , especially when it involves Roger Clark , another millionaire patient of Stanwyck 's . And he 's not understanding as to her professional obligations . Stanwyck , like Bette Davis and Katharine Hepburn , was and is a feminist icon . When she tells Fonda that he ought to go out in the working world and live on a salary and see if he can do it , Fonda goes out and gets a job as a salesman in a department store . She 's so proud of him , that she actually is going to give up her medical practice and live with him on his salesman 's salary . Today NOW would be picketing the film . Stanwyck did not have too much conviction in her performance , probably because she did n't believe any of it . I certainly could n't . I do n't think even back then audiences believed it either . But the two stars and the rest of the cast tried their best , but this one was a Thanksgiving special . sub_rate: 0.002457002457002457; NE_rate: 0.0
Northanger Abbey is not my favorite Jane Austen novel , but it has its charms . This movie does n't . It has some of the same character names as the book , but the story is drastically altered , and the sweetest man in the whole Austen canon ( unless Emma 's Mr. Knightley gets pride of place ) is made out to be a heartless and mercenary creep . One or two totally extraneous characters are introduced , and a palpable atmosphere of corseted perversion hangs over it all . I was thus disappointed when I first saw it on its release in 1986 ; even today it ranks high on the list of films that disgrace the books on which they 're based . Even Robert Hardy fans should give this one a wide berth . It has nothing , and I mean N - O - T - H - I - N - G , to recommend it . sub_rate: 0.012195121951219513; NE_rate: 0.0

This is one of those films with a great potential . Brilliant actors , a debut from a very interesting director and a haunting " Survivor"-ish plot . But it does not work at all . To start with the good thing : The cinematography is stunning . The beauty of the Namibian desert shows itself as a merciless surrounding , also in the pictures . And then there is the acting . Quite allright . Jennifer Jason Leigh has never been better . Bruce Davison also seems to have developed his character from Altman 's " Short Cuts" . Then the disappointments : Janet McTeer . Romane Bohringer . And the plot . Why on earth does Levring pick " Lear " for their play ? The whole idea of letting Shakespeare articulate their despair and inner longings does not work . It seems like a facade . And it is clear that the tragedies takes place because of the choice of " Lear " . They just needs to fit in in the Script by Levring and Academy Award winner Anders Thomas Jensen . And the sex . It takes about three days , then more or less all of the characters are sexually frustrated . Dahh ! ! Sex is always the easy way out when you are in need of a crisis in a plot . Janet McTeer 's part totally falls apart , mainly because of that ridiculous idea . The sex makes the plot fall promptly to the ground . Instead they could have focused on the dialogue . There must have been conversation between all of the characters , but we mainly see them talking in smaller groups . Their talking though is as dead as " Lear " and the rest of the film . "The King Is Alive " still is not the worst Danish dogme ' 95 movie yet . But comparing it to the most recent of the homegrown dogme ' 95 films " Italiensk for begyndere " by Lone Scherfig , this one fails badly . It is not a good film . It is a big one .

This movie has lots of action and little heart. Let's forget for a minute that it gets just about every aspect of the Russian Revolution wrong - after all we only have only under an hour here to tell our story. In fact, the czar abdicated after World War I proved a disaster for the country, and a provisional government tried to rule as a pseudo-democracy until the Leninists took power nine months later, mainly because they promised to immediately withdraw Russia from the war. Now, back to our story.Here we have the revolution being "rumored" in Russian newspapers in what appears to still be a functioning country until violence erupts suddenly and upends the life of nobleman Baron Nikita 'Nikki' Krasnoff (Douglas Fairbanks Jr.). He flees his home with his former servant girl Tanyusha (Nancy Carroll) in tow, and they start to make a new life in Constantinople. Before the revolution the Baron made a regular habit out of making a play for the girl, not out of any real passion, but out of boredom as a diversion of sorts. The revolution doesn't change this, and he continues to try to take advantage of what is obviously a very simple girl. It certainly doesn't make the audience like this guy to see him toying with her so. Tanyusha follows the Baron because she literally has no place to go after the revolutionaries take over the Baron's home, and she has known no other life other than waiting on Nikki hand and foot. Once in Constantinople, Nikki quickly wearies of life as a penniless laborer, and that is when he meets up with his former lover, Russian aristocrat Vera Zimina, who has a plan for getting them to Paris where the Tsarists have congregated after the revolution. Unfortunately for Tanyusha, Vera's plan does not include her.This film manages to completely waste the considerable acting talents of early talkie actress Nancy Carroll. She does a good job with what little she is given to do, but that is not much. Lilyan Tashman is the standout here, even though she has only a small role as Russian vamp Vera. Lilyan was so often given supporting roles just as she is here, but her earthy voice and glamorous looks make her the center of attention in every scene in which she appears. Guy Kibbee even shows up in a humorous bit as an American tourist who is curious about the Russian royalty that has been forcefully ejected from their homeland. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
Thomas Hardy is one of my favorite authors. Some truly wonderful movies have been made from his novels ("Far From the Madding Crowd," "Tess of the D'Urbervilles," "The Mayor of Casterbridge"), and I had high hopes for this one. The Hallmark-Hall-of-Fame-ification of "Return of the Native" totally wrecked it. The cast was terrific, the photography excellent, but the script was dismal and the direction positively ruinous. People walked up to people, said lines, walked away. A meager excitement developed when Clive Owen and Catherine Zeta Jones (very young, very beautiful) exchanged a bit of flesh-pressing, but even Clive, who is a superb actor, couldn't save it. It was awash with the usual Hallmark "romantic" strings background music and pretend bumpkins offering plot exposition, and what could have been dynamite turned out to be awful.

The movie starts in Mexico where a girl has been cursed, she spits on snakes thru green jello and her friend tries all these crazy spells to lift the curse. He does nothing but chant horrible language that does nothing, so they decide to cross the border get on the train to make their way to L.A. to see his uncle to lift the curse. Comic hilarity ensues. This movie has the same snakes over and over! It has garden snakes and pythons that will never bite. They all make the sound of rattlesnakes which makes no sense.

So we 're supposed to find it funny that this woman travels all the way to the jungle - to the warzone - just to find out why her fiancée did n't travel to Switzerland ? Or are we supposed to take it seriously ? It 's not even remotely funny , clever or entertaining - it 's unintelligent - and so is the movie . The lead actress is one of the most vexatious characters I have ever seen in a movie - even worse than Jar - Jar Binks . Dialog tries very hard to be funny ( almost all the time ) but it never is . The number of funny jokes is somewhere between 7 and zip . And as for the game - did they even once bothered to explain to us what are the rebels fighting for ( other than being anti - government ) ? I guess that did n't matter to anyone - neither to the rebels nor to the characters who just blindly flew to the battlefield . Do n't knock your time .

1st watched 3/17/2002 - 2 out of 10(Dir - Mario Pinzauti ) : Silly , sex - filled master & slave having too many intimate relations movie . This movie seemed to care more about the sex than the story and kind of worked the story around the sex . risible dubbing of the original Italian language in the version I watched with ridiculous ending where the attempt is made to give an anti - slave statement(or should I say one phone ) . What a dissipation of time for everyone who watches this wish . sub_rate: 0.041666666666666664; NE_rate: 0.0
When I first watched this film, I thought that it would be rally good, because it featured my favourite actor of all time. He gives a sterling performance, though it is fairly obvious he didn't have to life more than half a finger to make the róle work. He is the only good thing in it, unlesss you're into explosions and American dream-working class hero trash (which I'm not). I don't get it. How can this film get away with being so naf. That bit with the little boy being rescued, I mean, come on! You can't tell me that he would have been rescued without the fire-guy wearing any goggles (I know for a fact that it would have been pitch black in there and you can't see for more than a couple of feet infront of you) and no breathing equipment (he'd have choked after 2 minutes!). This film was just bad, OK?Why Robert? WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY????!!!!Sorry if this is your favourite film. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
Wow, what exciting visual effects. I also loved the costumes and artwork, the circus and ethereal feel to the film was sublime. It just required the need for the viewer to worry about the fate of our protagonist. As she is trapped in her imagination, there is never a sense of peril unlike, say, David Lynch's films which haunt every time. This also draws attention to which age group this film is aimed at. Who would this engage?Mirrormask is obviously going to draw comparisons with Labyrinth with the teen- angst/ fantasy theme, but unfortunately it doesn't really come close to delivering the same Henson essence. The ill mother theme is never fully explained and certainly not something that you care about while lapping up the eye candy.Not agonisingly awful a la The Cell, nor as engagingly dreamlike as Labyrinth - a forgettable but good-looking fantasy. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
Unfortunately this is not as good as any of the other films that Jim Carrey ( producing and starring ) and Brian Grazer have worked on together , but bits of it are definitely worth a look for laughs . Basically Dick Harper ( Carrey ) thinks he is being promoted to a better job . That 's until the company of Dynocorpe sinks and closes down . Now Dick and his wife Jane ( Téa Leoni ) , and their son of course , are in trouble with money . No matter what they try , they ca n't raise the kind of money they really want . So they start robbing a few places . And then they decide to rob the guy that set Dick up , his ex - boss Jack McAllister ( Alec Baldwin ) . I think the most funny bits are when Carrey 's in the elevator singing " I Believe I Can Fly " and the bit when he ties up someone in a robbery , and is speaking with a voice changer ( he sounds like a crap robot ) .

After reading the reviews I decided to rent the DVD version . I like classical music and wanted to learn more about Bach . I was disappointed . I guess I do not know enough about Bach music and the the comments were not enough for me to understand the importance or what music was being played . Maybe it would be appropriate with the guidance of an expert in Bach 's music that can explain the film . I truly tried and saw the whole film hopping that I would be able to enjoy at least some of it , but I did not . See it at your own endangerment . sub_rate: 0.017699115044247787; NE_rate: 0.0
It is one of the joys of Shakespeare that there can be no definitive performances - no single performance can be right ' , but some can be wrong , and this one is . There are at least two things about Hamlet which can not be dispensed with : 1 . His indecisiveness and inability to take any kind of action . For God 's sake that is what makes the play last as long as it does . If you had Othello there instead of Hamlet , Claudius would be dead by the end of Act One . Any production has to try to explain why Hamlet delays , why he is incapable of action . 2 . His sexual disgust . His total revulsion at the thought of what his mother and uncle get up to in bed fill him with an perfect disgust for all things sexual and this means that any kind of relationship with Ophelia is impossible . At the slightest hint of sex , Hamlet throws up . So , what does Mel Gibson give us ? Lusty action - man . You could not get further from the character of Hamlet if you tried . There are lots of ways Hamlet can be played , but this is n't one of them ! What I do n't understand is since they managed to get such good actors for the other parts - Claudius , Polonius and so on , why could n't they find one to play Hamlet as well . Mark Rylance in the part would have made this a great film . This Mel Gibson ' , whoever he is , completely let down the rest of the cast . And lets face it , Hamlet without the prince really does n't work . sub_rate: 0.003289473684210526; NE_rate: 0.0

"Flashdance" meets "Meatballs III" or maybe it should just be called "Meatballs IV". This is my friend Wesley's all-time favorite movie, largely because he still has a thing about J.V. cheerleaders. As someone once said: "This is fine-more than fine-but as you get older you need to branch out. Whether you want to or not, society demands it"."Gimme An F" has cinema's greatest J.V. cheerleader Mary Ann (played by Beth Miller), who looks like a sweet-faced Alicia Silverstone from before her "Clueless" days. Wesley hates Miller's other film, the horrific "Teen Wolf Too" made three years later, where she plays a fickle southern belle much like Martha Smith's character in "Animal House". Personally I admire Miller's range as the two characters could not be more different and she is convincing as both.Anyway, Mary Ann is a naïve novice cheerleader from Moline (a member of "The Lucky Ducks" squad) who comes to Camp Beaverview for cheerleading instruction. She's befriended by Jenna (Karen Lee Kelly), the leader of the tough girl squad-appropriately named "The Demons". Jenna becomes protective of Mary Ann after her main rival takes an instant dislike to Mary Ann.Later Mary Ann gets a crush on Tommy Hamilton, the head instructor. Tommy is spending his summer wrestling with the dilemma of having to grow up and move on, which is a problem as his only skills are teaching cheerleading and performing elaborate dance routines in the shower, for the enjoyment of viewers who get off on that sort of thing. Phoebe (Daphne Ashbrook) is Tommy's long-suffering girlfriend, she has a well-adjusted attitude and an experienced perspective. She even tolerates Tommy's flirtation with Mary Ann-trusting that Tommy will not actually take advantage of young Mary Ann.While these four characters are solid and their relationships have a nice charm, the supporting cast is almost as weak as the material they have to work with. Which is a shame because had they brought some actual comic relief to the production it would have been a decent film. Jennifer Cooke plays Pam, a social climbing and terminally peppy instructor who is carrying on with camp's money-hungry owner Bucky. And there is another couple with a thing for the characters from "Mad Max". Since nothing is very funny you are left with only a cute semi-romance and some great dance routines.An attempt is made to create some suspense by slowly leading up a final competition but unless this is your first movie experience the outcome is never in doubt. And there is a back-story about some Japanese businessmen Bucky wants to get money from, but it goes nowhere dramatically or comically.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
Loving the Andersen fairy tails as a child and recently having seen some intriguing documentaries on this odd , though brilliant , author , I eagerly looked forward to see this made - for - TV film . Unfortunately the experience was nothing but a disappointment leaving me in anger and confusion . First of all the story / book is filled with inaccuracies and sheer fantasies and in this way creating almost a completely new story while shamefully abusing Andersen 's fairy tales , presumably in order to sell the crap to suckers like me . Secondly , pretty - boy actor ( really ... ever seen a picture of the real Andersen ? ) Kieran Brew manages to portray Hans Christian as mentally retarded rather than the brilliant though very disturbed quality he indeed was . Though annoying and irritating like Andersen , Brew is missing the required charisma to create any feelings of compassion what so ever . Thirdly . The love story between Andersen and the fictional Jetta ( whom actually should be Henriette , the wife of Edvard Collin ) ... Why ? This man has lived such an interesting life , it should be enough as a foundation to a great movie!I could continue this to be a very long list but feel it safest to simply recommend all of you to spend your time and money on something else instead . sub_rate: 0.012605042016806723; NE_rate: 0.0

If they had just toned it down a little . Are there really people out there that find it funny and like it ? I was relieved to know that IMDb readers rated it so low . The career side to the story was intriguing as well as the young man trying to get a promotion and win the bosses favor . I liked that part .

I 'm giving it a three instead of the lower number it deserves because of its history . A full - length movie made by high school students ! It shows , too , but that 's part of the charm and appeal . Get ahold of some of the stuff George Lucas did at UCLA ; this is better . Maybe due to being a group effort . A monster made of toxic dissipation and too much garbage -- these kids were way ahead of their time!--starts ravaging the town of Milpitas during a high school dance . The monster destroys randomly , leaving garbage and smelly footprints . The movie has local TV and radio people , the Milpitas mayor , the Samuel Ayer High School principal , and a whole bunch of the high school students and their parents , not to mention the mayor 's daughter as the ingénue . Dumb ? Yeah ! Fun ? Yeah ! Great screen writing ? C'mon , they 're untrained high schoolies ! Copy that comment for the acting , cinematography , directing , et cetera .

Another example of the women - in - prison genre . This is not just a genre known for quality films , but this is a notch below most . A lot of women are taken from the bordellos where they work to a prison on a rocky island . Once there , they are subjected to scores of poorly directed sex and unspeakable " dialog . " For a film with an astounding sum of sex and nudity there is genuinely zip erotic about any of it . The sex scenes are awkwardly acted , and some scenes , like the exhibitor scene , seem to drag on and on . That said , there are at least some minimal production values .

You could see the final outcome from a mile away . All the signs were there .... the prom , the liquor , the fast ride , the distraction of the females .... A good commercial for seatbelt usage , and later model vehicles that sit the passengers further back from the windshield . Also , the ending is rather anti climatic , as the Ford Econoline van barely suffers a crease across its nose after hitting a bridge abuttment at high speed ( highly unlikely).More damage to the van would have made it a little more believable . And why do these films always take place during / after a prom ? Is it a showcase of once you survive the prom , you will be good for life ? More than anything else , it shows the lack of policing the prom for liquor , and not keeping tabs on the MINORs who are leaving the dance for a joyride . sub_rate: 0.006134969325153374; NE_rate: 0.0

If good intentions were enough to produce a good film , I would have rated the turgid , ponderous , obvious " Focus " a bit higher than 4 . Macy does his best , but as an earlier poster commented , Miller 's little parable asks us to suspend disbelief too often . Perhaps the novel gives us a bit more background on Newman , so we can understand how someone who is obviously not without intelligence could be so dense in perceiving the attitudes of those around him . I agree with another reviewer that if one is unaware of how bigoted average citizens were in America during this time period , then this movie might be an eye - opener . I grew up in the fifties , and the " good " pastors of my Lutheran church found nothing wrong with having the church picnic at a commercial beach , whose sign prominently indicated that no Jews or blacks would be admitted . It is difficult for young people today to understand that this was the norm , and not just in the South . As late as 1964 , when I graduated from a somewhat racially integrated ( but sexually segregated ) public high school in Baltimore , my black classmates could not attend the traditional " father and son banquet , " as it was held at a facility which did not admit blacks . Sadly , it was an establishment owned by a Jewish family . The subject matter of " Focus " is important , and we should never forget , despite the lingering signs of racism in modern America , how truly repulsive the attitudes of that previous generation were.(The " greatest generation , " indeed ) . So , perhaps this film is fairly valuable in countering the recent wave of sentimental crap about the forties from the likes of Steven Spielberg and Tom Brokow . But in the end , as in " Far From Heaven , " the filmmakers ' good intentions are undermined by having a protagonist so ridiculously oblivious to the social conventions of their time . sub_rate: 0.002770083102493075; NE_rate: 0.0

" nemesis of Michael Myers " is a very frustrating piece to deal with for a fan of the Halloween series . After a very dissatisfactory letdown in Halloween 5 , the series reached a near ebb in plot lines , with a silly devolution into witchcraft and a teenage cult dedicated to the worship of Michael Myers . " Curse of Michael Myers " ups the ante in blood and gore , but really represents a decay in the series ' integrity . It 's too bad to , as this is the last movie for Donald Pleasance as the character of Dr. Loomis . Pleasance has some good screen moments ( precious ones if your a fan of the series ) as the now very aged and as he says " very retired doctor " . Sadly he died before the movie was completed , and it is very apparent at the conclusion of the film that the stories original climatic scene was never realized . Right from the beginning credits , Halloween 6 has more of the feel of a made - for - TV movie then that of the block - buster horror flick that it started out as in 1978 .

A reasonably transparent attempt to wring cash out of the thriving British club scene , Sorted is a film that shows promise in certain departments , but does very little else . A perfunctory thriller game ( which is there merely to string the club sequences together ) , variable acting and a somewhat preposterous book , all stop Sorted from being the showcase that director Jovy obviously intended . However , although Jovy is sometimes over indulgent ( especially when using the often ill - fitting dance music ) he does show potential , and the lack of an anti drugs content is enormously refreshing . Overall however , the film is a wasted opportunity , and the prospects for a great clubbing movie remain out there somewhere . Watchable nevertheless . sub_rate: 0.045112781954887216; NE_rate: 0.0

European films may be slower - paced and less plot driven than American films , but this takes it way too far . It also show a solid bunch of incompletely drawn characters doing inexplicable things . It 's not fantasy , it 's not even surreal , it 's just awkward and high . What 's the message here ? That people in France are pensive and gaze morosely a lot ? That they like to watch other people having sex ? They they spontaneously scream or touch a stranger on his neck ? Do not wear a watch when seeing this film , as you will be astonished at how little is explained or learned over huge stretches of time . This is the story of a " police superintendent " who is deeply troubled by the brutal murder of a little girl , though actually he seems troubled before then . He is not merely upset at his own personal tragedies , but apparently mentally quite slow , behaving very much like a learning - disabled six - year old child . He stares blankly a lot , walks with arms rigid like a little kid , speaks in meek , simpering , tones , behaves quite oddly in all of his interactions ( though no one seems to notice or care , even when it is supposed to be police business ) . He 's not a troubled cop , more of an outpatient . Picture Andy Kaufman 's Latka character on Taxi , but without the humor . He is not only not believable as a policeman he is not believable as an adult . That he won an award for this interpretation of his character is truly amazing -- unless he was playing the part exactly as written and the fault lies with the weirdos who scripted this thing . The plot is clearly secondary . Do not expect to see anything remotely like what police would do if a little girl was found murdered . This not that important , though the implausibility of their behavior is sort of insulting . The problem is that the rest of the film makes no sense either . That leaves the long lingering close - ups of fields , vegetable gardens , people 's faces etc . The ending struck me as especially ridiculous -- totally unsupported by the events leading up to it -- unless you think , " What 's the worst way this film could end?"There is lots of sex and nudity , which is supposed to mean something . You want vaginas ? You 'll see vaginas . Not to worry , it 's art . It has deep meaning , what I am not sure . And the protagonist , despite his innocent weirdness , seems to have some sort of homoerotic neck or jowl fetish . Finally , the subtitles are in white and frequently appear on a white background -- very hard to read many of them . On the other hand , there is n't much dialogue , so this is n't a big problem . There is also very little sound -- not even ambient sounds you would expect to hear -- in the film , contributing to the emptiness of the whole experience . The old Woody Allen would have had a field day parodying this work . That this is an award - winning film is sad . I would hate to see the losing films .

Leatherheads is an apt title , however a leather strap would be more useful to self - flagellate oneself after purchasing a ticket to watch this noxious attack at entertainment . Clooney 's attempt at self deprecating humor comes across with a quiet thud as his demeanor implies that he is anything but . Perhaps with another actor playing the Clooney role , the movie might be marginally palatable . Sorry George , I doubt there will be any Oscar nods this time . George Clooney is definitely a fish out of water when it comes to comedy ( unless you are referencing to his politics ) . Anyway , only the most ardent of Clooney fans will enjoy watching Leatherheads , everyone else will long for the days of the silent picture . sub_rate: 0.007462686567164179; NE_rate: 0.0
It 's difficult to carry how high this movie is . Even in the 1950s when intellectual searching for the meaning of life was fashionable and beatnik rejection of physical comforts , clean clothes , haircuts , etc . was a common reaction to the smug middle - class mores of both the USA and western Europe , this movie would have been a stinker . The plot is a mishmash of several dei ex machina ( if that 's the correct Latin grammar ) ; the acting consists of deadpan stares broken by occasional hysterics ( by the male lead as well as the females ) ; the uncalled view of Catherine Deneuve 's ( or somebody 's ) breasts are worthy of a Budweiser commercial ; the repeated cacaphonous orchestra rehearsal in the abandoned building is I ' m great heavy with meaning in music director 's mind but to me barely 7 one unintelligent stupid symbol thrown into nonmeaningful picture movie -- I ' m ranting prison my time has been wasted watching this scam self for an art flic .

Oddly, I have very little to say about "The Box" so this will be pretty brief. I have never read the Richard Matheson novella "Button, Button" from which the film is based, but considering what I saw in this "adaptation", there couldn't have been much semblance to such a legendary author's work. "The Box" is about a family who discover a strange contraption on their doorstep that has a button on it. Frank Langella shows up and explains how they will be given one million dollars if they push the button - the only 'catch' is that it will automatically kill someone, somewhere... ??SPOILER?? They push it ??END OF SPOILERS?? That whole concept was interesting on its own, but somehow they managed to extend the movie into some convoluted Stargate knock-off that pads it out until a pretty decent ending with a pretty profound message. While I'm trying to be as 'fair' as possible, I still must say that this was not my cup of tea and it bored me severely. I guess its from the same director as "Donnie Darko" which I remember liking when I saw it years ago. "The Box" would've worked well as a short film, but since it was so lifelessly adapted this way, I can't come close to recommending it... sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
Jim Wynorski strikes again with the very literal minded KOMODO VS . COBRA . No guesswork here . A giant CGI komodo dragon -- it sort of looks like a dog minus fur -- takes on a humongous CGI king cobra , with a bunch of tree huggers and others caught in between . The tree huggers get charter boat captain Michael Pare ( who else ? ) to take them to an off - limits federal island . An experiment by a mad scientist in growing very large veggies has become an experiment in growing very great critters , thank so to our nutty military . Now all that 's left on the island are the very large critters and the mad scientist 's tiny , shapely daughter . The group runs into her at the old plantation lab , the monsters arrive , and the chase is on . If you watch enough Wynorski / Sci - Fi Channel flicks , you 'll recognize some of the sets and locations from many other movies . Acting is nonexistent , as is the plot . At the very least , you can enjoy watching the badly animated compo / dog stomp down on its intended victims just before scarfing them up . The cobra just strikes and swallows . No imagination at all . sub_rate: 0.0044444444444444444; NE_rate: 0.0
Rented this tonite from my local video store . It was titled " Black Horizon . " I guess someone felt this was good enough for a 2004 re - release ... Micheal Dudikoff is unfortunetly not a ninja in this movie , 7 of the major flaws of this film right off the bat . Another major flaw would be that Ice - t 's action scenes are stolen from other movies , particularly the first scene of his rescue , which is directly from the Wesley Snipes movie " The Art of War , " with Ice - T edited in . I hope they paid for that footage . The game is amazing , the exceptional effects had little effort put into them ( love those wires holding them in space ) , the playacting is wooden ( also love those New York / Russian accents ) . Ice - T being in the movie is superfluous . These guys also forgot the fact that there is no gravity in space , but I guess they were n't worried about it . Micheal Dudikoff should go back to doing what he 's " good " at and make American Ninja 6 . sub_rate: 0.02926829268292683; NE_rate: 0.16666666666666666

STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits Based on another of Stephen King's lengthy novellas, this takes place in the sleepy little New England town of Castle Rock (also the name of the film's production company!), where a new antiques store, the titular Needful Things, has opened. The owner and proprietor, Leland Gaunt (Max Von Sydow) hides, you might say, a devilish secret. There's an item in his store that everyone in the little town wants-a small cash price upfront is first required, before a far more sinister price is asked for. As suspicion, hate and madness tear the town apart, it falls to police chief Alan Pangborn (Ed Harris) to restore order and save the town from a terrifying end...I read the novel of Needful Things earlier this year, and was eager to watch the movie adaptation again to compare them (like that was going to be any contest!) But it had been deleted on video and DVD and I couldn't find anywhere to rent it from. So I was happy when I finally found it in a flea market whilst on a shopping trip...It's one of the cruelest ironies that King novels are generally the best to read but when they get adapted to screen nine times out of ten they are complete junk, as is the case here. The material that makes his books great simply doesn't translate into a movie script very well, for some reason. And I suppose there's always the question: why bother watching this when I could be reading the book again instead? I appreciate that some are simply too lengthy (i.e. It, The Stand) to be made into a complete screen work with all the situations and characters included, but there's no reason this one couldn't have included all the material from the book. As a result, a lot of key characters from the book (i.e. Ace Merrill) are not included at all and we have some terrible character development that means we don't care about the characters that are involved since they are so stripped of depth and motivation- for example we have one character from the book, Danforth Keaton, who murders his wife toward the end yet we were shown no build-up to hint at any reason that he didn't get along with or hated her and so it has no impact when it happens, unlike in the book where there was a lot of depth invested and it really involved you to find out what happened to the characters involved. All the material in the script to fill in the cracks, if you like, is really stupid and corny and the typically goofy stuff that gets included in King adaptations like this.Most of the film's problems are that it deviates so far away from the book but there's also some terrible acting from a cast that obviously can't feel for the daft material they're being asked to perform. In the 90s, a lot of King's work started skipping the cinema and just being made into made-for-TV/video territory. Rubbish like this must surely hint at why. ** sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
Of all the films I have seen , this one , The Rage , has got to be one of the worst still . The direction , Ford , continuity , changes in game - book and dialogue made me scream out in pain . " How could ANYONE derive up with something thus stinky " ? Gary Busey is know for his " bacillus " movies , but this is a sure " W " picture . ( due = waste).Take for example : about two dozen FBI & local law officers surround a trailer house with a jeep wagoneer . Inside the jeep is MA and is " confused " as to why all the cops are about . Within hours a immense gun battle ensues , MA being killed straight off . The cops blast away at the jeep with gary and company blasting forth at them . The cops fall like dominoes and the jeep with Gary drives around in circles and are not hit by one single heater / pellet . MA is killed and gary seems to not to suffer noticed - damn that guy is tough . Truly a miracle , not since the six - shooter held 300 bullets has there been such a miracle . sub_rate: 0.0794392523364486; NE_rate: 0.0
One of the problems with popular culture , especially when discussing the popular culture of the 1970s , is that mass media - especially television - is usually about four years behind ' underground ' media , primarily music . Many people think the ' Woodstock Generation " remained important throughout the 1970s ; actually , it was all over at Altamont in 1970 . By 1972 , ' underground ' rock or the ' counterculture ' had moved east to England and Led Zepplin , Black sabbath , and David Bowie , early metal - heads and the so - called ' glam - rockers , ' who were all ' peace and love ' - not . Neither , in a darkly different vein , was Charles Manson 's ' family . ' This obvious pilot for a television show ( that , thankfully , was never picked up by the networks ) is attempting to come to terms with a culture that was already as withered as yesterday 's flowers . The script must have been lying around a few years - by the time it was produced , writer Carlino had already achieved recognition for tough Mafia revenge tales . And the cultural references are all to " Easy Rider " and Woodstock ( 1969 ) . The music referenced on the soundtrack is actually earlier , 1966/67 - at Woodstock Hendrix , Canned Heat , and Sly and the Family Stone had blasted this kind of folk - pop into oblivion . The movie is about a middle - class family that goes on the road in order to meet hippies . Wow , man , farout , outasight , it 's a groovy mind - blowing happening of a bag . However , politics count for nothing - Vietnam ? some place in Asia , right ? This average ( meaning dusty and vacuous ) TV movie is only redeemed by Jeff Bridges ' surprisingly mature performance as the young college drop - out who convinces his parents and grandma to ' discover ' ( hippie ) America . All the rest of the performances are standard TV fair by standard TV actors of the time . The director avails himself of some nice location cinematography , but differently the film is a short way to spend 90 minutes . I knew it was all over when Sal Mineo remarks of a young runaway ( who tells the other characters they are not really there ) : " She 's a latent existentialist . " Wow , far out , groovy . A couple extra points for being ' so bad it 's funny , ' but if you do n't care about the ' 70 's TV version of the ' 60 's , stay away . sub_rate: 0.006329113924050633; NE_rate: 0.0
After having watched Darwin 's Nightmare , one must have the impression of Tanzania being a living hell , with its population being quasi - slaves delivering the finest fish to the well - fed Europeans while leaving the fish bones to the starving population . In exchange for the fish they get western - made weapons , which the mainly unemployed population eagerly awaits to use , because being a soldier is their only source of income . So everything is all dark with trade as the incarnation of evil and source of all miserableness ? Not quite . Fortunately Darwin 's Nightmare shows the dark sides only and completely spares the positive aspects . In fact , the documentary hardly tells anything about the economic and ecologic importance the victoriaperch has for the region . For the countries around lake Victoria the victoriaperch is the second to third most important source of income . The wages in the fishing industry are way above average . Tanzania has banned huge trawlers to secure the jobs of thousands of fishermen . The adjacent states have met agreements to keep fishing on a sustainable level . Cities at the lake are benefiting from the taxes the fishers have to pay for each kilogram caught fish and the taxes on the factories ' exports and profits . Furthermore Tanzania has banned exporting the local traditional fish , which still play an important role feeding the local population . By ignoring those positive signs the documentary deters the badly needed western consumers and investors and thus threatens to aggravate the African 's situation . For further reading I can recommend two articles the German alternative - wing newspaper wrote on the subject : http://www.taz.de/pt/2006/09/02/a0013.1/textdruck http://www.taz.de/pt/2005/03/17/a0151.1/text sub_rate: 0.003424657534246575; NE_rate: 0.0

With Al Jolson at the height of his popularity and Warner Brothers 's the Jazz Singer having been the highest grossing film of 1927 , it was inevitable that the other studios would churn out a few vehicles for their own Jolson - esquire characters . But while the Jazz Singer was a sensation for its being the first part - talkie , the Matinée Idol lacks the singing voice of its star ( the now obscure Johnnie Walker ) , and has to make do with just his visual antics . The Matinée Idol was an early directorial duty for the renowned Frank Capra . Capra 's first couple of full - length features for Harry Langdon reveal a very showy , excessive style , which made Langdon 's already mediocre slapstick almost unwatchable . A couple of pictures later and Capra has learnt to ease off a bit , with some fairly regular and decent camera - work . However he still shows no aptitude for shooting physical comedy . The longest comic routine - the stage performance - seems to have a few good gags , but it 's all cut up into lots of different camera angles , and there is no chance for the comedy to flow naturally from the performances . Theoretically , a good portion of the jokes are in the intertitles , but there are far too many of these and none of them is especially funny . Of course , Capra would eventually mature into a fine dramatic and romantic director , and you can see him beginning to develop in this respect . He cuts down the line , closing in on Walker and Bessie love in the scene where she first lays eyes on him in his Don Wilson get up , neatly establishing the wordless connection between them . Then there is some beautiful and tender framing of the couple in their scene together at the masquerade , which is all very reminiscent of the love scenes in Capra 's early 30s output . Johnnie Walker , Columbia 's answer to Al Jolson , is not an exceptional talent . His comic timing is good but there is nothing to make him stand out . Bessie Love on the other hand is a pretty good actress too , with a very expressive face . Kudos to her for getting involved with the physical comedy and losing her dignity with the boys . There 's also a good role for Lionel Belmore , that rotund and jolly character actor who seems to turn up in absolutely everything in the late 20s and early 30s . The Matinée Idol is one of those pictures that has gained more than its fair share of attention thanks to its director later having made a handful of masterpieces . In and of itself it is a very uninteresting piece , and like most of Capra 's work before he met Robert Riskin , a disappointment . sub_rate: 0.0019880715705765406; NE_rate: 0.0
I truly enjoy this genre but The Cell was one of the worst movies I ' ve ever been unfortunate enough to watch . While about 25 percent of my audience wandered in and out of the theater during the viewing ( or alone entirely ) I was silent enough to stick it out . The main problems with this story ( there were too many to list all ) is that with this type of film you have to do two things ... one , provide fear of the killer ( being that they catch him twenty minutes into the film that 's gone ) and you must give the victim whose life is at stake ( the girl in the tank ) enough character development that you actually care whether they get to her in time or not . Not only did I lose track of the girl , I was given such little insight into her that she was only a blurry face and when I did remember she was part of the story truly really did n't care what happened to her . While the visuals were interesting in an LSD flashback sort of way , they often times made no sense and this should be a lesson that visuals ca n't make up for lack of a good story ( see Phantom Menace for another example ) Finally , does anyone know or care what was up with the women kneeling in that field and staring at the sky ?

It is tremendous ! It is like soul gave a kid a faulty video camera and $ 30 and told them to make a film . Even then you 'd get a better and more professional film than this . The story is thus silent you can say there is n't one . I do n't think the guy who made this knew what to do at all -- watching foreign art movies all day long is n't decent to make somebody an instant director . The acting is very tough , really kindergarten spirit and the composition is exactly apparently amazing . The only scene I did n't hate was the one with the caravan accident but even that only means it was just slightly less horrible than the rest of the film . How do people get finance for this stuff ? I do n't mind alternative films but should n't they at least not be a big steaming pile of cow manure ? I would call ' Price of Milk ' amateurish if it was n't an abuse to amateurs .

Ugh . still the ever - popular Diane Lane could not save this movie , and the most exciting affair about the movie was seeing if Rourke 's face would move . One has heard so much " gossip " about his botched face lift , etc . , so like an accident on the side of the road , we just had to slow down and see the wreck . The plot was thin . Here we possess a very professional mob hit man who somehow latches on to a wild and uncontrollable punk / crook , and throughout this movie we 're wondering why this guy stays with this idiot , let alone gets together with the guy in the first place . Then the crime that was not even committed has the pro to go after the witnesses . He would have popped them right then and there . But then , we would not have had a movie then , would we ? And why did the realtor even agree to the extortion ? There were more holes in this picture than in my colander . The playacting was India , the entire motion predictable down to the minute , and even the ending . And so much could have been done to make this a very better movie .

Normally , I do n't like Chuck Norris films . I appreciate his work as a martial artist , and his fight scenes are usually fairly well - choreographed . Chuck is undeniably one of the martial arts greats . So , in my local used bookstore , I found a film I had n't seen before and took it home . While the acting in this movie was worse than most Chuch Norris films , I was hoping to see at least one fight scene . I quickly began to realize that this was n't a typical Chuch Norris film ; rather it was a Christian film , destined to illustrate the " good will win out " paradigm . There is really zip on the packaging to indicate that this is a Christian film , with the exception of the label ... Goodtimes Entertainment , which I had never heard of before . I 'll certainly keep that in mind the next time I see a film from that company . I do n't have a problem with Christianity ... I do have a problem with sneaky proselytizing . If someone is going to make a religious film , at least have the good sense to indicate to the viewer that such is what they will get . The only redeeming part about the exercise is that I spent only $ 3.25 to spend 97 minutes to watch a great martial artist not fight . At least it was during supper - time , and I spent some of that cooking and eating . In short , if you 're looking for a fair martial arts film , and not hoping for much , do n't bother with this film because it does n't even offer that . sub_rate: 0.006666666666666667; NE_rate: 0.0
This one and the one prior " Toulon 's Revenge " and the next one seem to be completely different from the first two movies where the puppets were not so nice . It is basically choose your series , the first two go together and paint the puppets as killers , while the next three are a series of them being the good guys . This one plays out to much like some cheesy television series episode to be as good as part three was and I never really had the urge to try and watch part five of the series . Basically , a kid gets the puppets while some strange dark lord or something sends his evil puppets out to kill , this dark lord looks like some sort of enemy from one of those live action Japanese shows like Ultraman . The movie is over before you know it though so it has to get credit for not inflicting you with a very unspeakable to watch movie .

This film is a hodge - podge of various preposterous cliches . For instance , boy - meets - spoilt - rich - girl and gets her to fall in love with him by harassing her in college ( an over - used backdrop in recent Indian commercial films ) . A male chauvinistic glorification of sexual conquest . The climax is predictable ( having been used ad nauseum in several other films ) .

Few videos in recent history have been as amateurishly produced as this one -- at least none that have been released by such a reputable distributor .

In either case it missed its mark . It 's not particularly historically accurate with characters being chopped and changed for the sake of the story . The performances were neither compelling nor bad .

I suppose that in 1997 Hollywood was n't quite at the point of openly celebrating homosexuality , so one might want to give some credit to those who put this movie together for having shown a little piece of courage . One just wishes that credit could be given them for having put together a really good movie , and in my opinion " In & Out " does n't qualify on that count . It 's the narration of Howard Brackett ( Kevin Kline ) - a humble town high school English teacher who on the eve of his wedding is outed by a former student who happens to win an Oscar and who then has to go through what can only be described as a period of self - discovery as he comes to terms with being homosexual . To me , that was the first job with this picture . Howard did n't really deliver to turn out to be gay . The movie would have been funnier ( and perhaps even more thought provoking ) had Brackett remained defiantly straight in spite of the stereotypically gay aspects to his life and the town 's belief after the Oscar speech that he was gay . ( In fact , I thought that identifying him as gay given the presence of those stereotypes might actually suffer been rather scornful to the gay community , as well as to straight men who like poetry and believe in dressing neatly ! ) Kline was nice enough in the role , and largely carried the film . Aside from him , most of the other cast members ( although fine actors ) were masses not really noted for their success on the great silver . Folks like Tom Selleck and Wilford Brimley and Bob Newhart are good actors but not great movie stars . I actually thought that the funniest ( if very humble ) role in the movie was that of the super model Sonya , played by an actress named David David ( speech of stereotypes , I loved her oh - so unimaginative example air " I promised to do that photo pullulate this afternoon . I have to shower and vomit ! " ) In the end , what really turned me off about this picture was the farcical ending , starting with the graduation ceremony ( and , to be honest , even if someone decided that the graduation was really necessary , the movie should have ended there , rather than proceeding on with the totally unnecessary nuptials at the end . ) Basically , I got a few chuckles out of this but nothing more . 3/10 sub_rate: 0.052980132450331126; NE_rate: 0.0
Irwin Allen's first venture into all star spectacle was one all star disaster. The Story of Mankind contains some of the most incredible casting decisions of all time. Virginia Mayo as the blond Cleopatra, Dennis Hopper chewing the scenery with Napoleon, Peter Lorre dining on the scenery for weeks as Nero, Marie Wilson as Marie Antoinette as a roadshow Marilyn Monroe, that's just some of them.The film also is known for being the last film which featured all three of the Marx Brothers though they all have different roles. Chico plays a monk who is Christopher Columbus's confidante, Groucho euchres the Indians out of Manhattan island as Peter Minuit, and most astonishing of all, Harpo Marx as Sir Isaac Newton who discovers gravity when an apple conks him on the bean. Holding all these portrayals together is a story where mankind itself is being judged. A super H Bomb is about to be discovered and let loose will do in the world's population. It's Judgement Day a coming.But mankind has its advocates and detractors. Speaking for the prosecution is Old Scratch who's been bringing the worst out in man for centuries in the form of Vincent Price. But man has his good side as well and who better than Ronald Colman to demonstrate man at his most civilized best. Colman and Price plead their case before The Judge played by Cedric Hardwicke. In those three individuals you have some of the finest speaking voices the English language ever knew. When the film is on them as they each bring out the exhibits for their case it's a pleasure to listen to. Then when the focus is on the individual stories, you want to scream in agony.What was Irwin Allen driving at, I'm still trying to figure it out. Was he deliberately camping it up with some of these casting decisions? If it was satire, it just doesn't get off the ground.This was Ronald Colman's farewell film and while it's hardly something I'd like to go out on, I can't think of any man who could have stated the case for civilization any better. So when you see The Story of Mankind, fast forward through some of the exhibits and treasure every moment the advocates are before the judge. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
I like Errol Flynn; I like biographies and I like action movies. This featured all three of these....but I didn't like this film. It just went on too long although the last 20 minutes was excellent, especially in the photography with some great low- angle shots. However, I seemed like it took six hour to get to that point, and I really can't say why I feel this way. The action is interesting, Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland are fine. In fact, it was refreshing to see de Havilland actually be supportive of Flynn instead of her normal role as antagonist to him. Yet something is lacking in this movie.The film has been roundly criticized for its historical inaccuracy but I don't hear that same criticism for a lot of other films which have done the same. In fact, its RARE when a film is historically accurate. For some reason, this revisionist history offended most critics. If the film had made General Custer a lot worse than he really was, they would have probably liked it. Well, too bad. In their twisted way, critics prefer villains to heroes. I really wish I could have enjoyed this more but I'll take a lot of other Flynn adventures over this one. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
There's nothing particularly unique or interesting about this run of the mill low budget sci-fi flick. Regardless of its pedigreed origin (the film is loosely based on a novel by Leo Tolstoy), the plot and overall themes of this film are in no way remarkable or original, the science is weak at best, and unfortunately, the film fails to even involve compelling action sequences.The plot begins with a manned space flight to Mars, and though the main plot doesn't really get rolling until the ship lands, most of the most interesting scenes occur en route. Unfortunately, as soon as our interplanetary travelers touch-down, their previously interesting interpersonal relationships, speculations about cosmology and the meaning of life, and everything interesting about the film all give way to an only remotely coherent plot concerning Martian revolutionaries, environmental problems and not very convincing webs of deceit.There is nothing very remarkable about the production quality of the film either. It's passable. And most of the acting is, though slow, OK. Cameron Mitchell is actually pretty good and plays a likable character. I guess the best quality of this film, from my perspective, is its fashion sense. The martians have very nice outfits! If this film had a point, it might have been much more interesting. Oh well. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
So many great actors , so little worth watching . But with a book that misses so much of what made the book special , I do n't hold it against anyone on screen . Though flawed , the book was one of Grisham 's only that I truly liked , especially how it captured the flavor of a deep south small town , a slightly different world to a coastal urbanite such as myself . I also loved the matter - of - factness , naturalness of what occurs in the book . In the movie characters are given a " nobility " of personality that seemed so stilted . The villains and foils are flat and 1 dimensional . But as with so much of Joel Schumacher 's work , genuineness and authenticity are conspicuously absent , and every point must be delivered via sledgehammer to the midsection . then preachy , stilted , and trivial about thus fearful a tragedy , I wish someone would do a remake and get the story a little more right . sub_rate: 0.027777777777777776; NE_rate: 0.0

Two : these guys being like real professional Pros , they will engage each other in intriguing Pro talk : " Look , Grissom , these are what we call fingerprints . Everybody has them , and they are different on each person . So , with these fingerprints we can actually find ... " . Yup ! Exactly like real pros would talk to each other if there was n't a completely uninformed and stupid audience around . However , not everything about this show is high .

When I first saw this movie , I said to myself , " Hey what the heck it sounds like a good movie , why not rent it ? " . So yeah , I rented it and went back home to see it . When I inserted it in my DVD player I was shocked . Well FIRST of all , no one told me it was a Mexican movie and was spoken in Spanish , good thing it had subtitles . SECOND , it was nude , nude NUDE ! Since I have no background whatsoever in Mexican movies , you could see my shock when I saw it . * GASP ! Covering virgin eyes , NOO*THIRD , predictable to say the least , but actually being it predictable was no excuse to me in liking movies , because I do n't seem to care if it 's predictable , unless it 's way over the top . FOURTH , how Heidi and Kike were reunited , indeed cheesy . FIFTH , how the picture ended . It was a defective , big ending . How Mr. Van der Linde 's sudden approval to the mayor 's election was because her daughter , knew how to throw the party ... BLAH , Blah . I was hoping that he was n't that easy to accept it , the director might have just rushed it . After all of this bashing of the tough stuff , the good stuff 's are here to come . The movie was really quite hilarious at some gunpoint with Maribel being clumsy in the kitchen and all , Heidi 's attitude , Valentina being poetic with words . What I truly also like about it was the song that Valentina made with her girl friend . That 's all , and for the other stuffs that I have n't mentioned they were just so - so . sub_rate: 0.024615384615384615; NE_rate: 0.0
I was rather emotional when I saw this picture in competitor at Depression Depression Depression Depression . Along with Ford and a few others , I thought the event of Australian grease force / civilization would be treated intelligently and in a manner compelling for picture - goers . The crush - tone promised ( in not thusly many Logos ) a Ford Ford Ford Ford for the grease - vehemence crew , something to cook us reflect our Ford - shoot - em - up mind in this nation . After waiting until after hours to be seated for a 7 cover ( what technological difficulties they would suffer encountered is beyond me ) , we were eventually let into the locus to learn the picture on DV ( where did the advertised 7 print start ? ) . I intend I scarcely answered my 5th head . The effect is an repulsive plenty . We have the " grease " , in a vignette with the most unrealistic " biker ' I possess always seen ( and I do recognize more than a few ) . The picture so lapses into irrelevant " quality ontogenesis " exclusively because the characters exist either a. stereotyped , b. nonstarter , David David David , and/or Australian racial caricatures . It takes hours hours hours to suffer to the game trend , and once we exist there , we wish for the vacuous conversations between the mates and/or the rockers and instrument brokers . The picture finds it 's finish , but not without leaving any cliché untried . I did n't give for the clean - wish characters who came in contact with the grease , and the characterisation of the nonage characters should deliver the Ford crying foul straight . All these masses Ford go after a gas , because they exist at the bed of the societal ice - deal , and would wait for an chance wherever it was found . Placing the activity a spirit upwardly would deliver at least provided some somebody - searching on the share of the characters . The biggest job is the promise unrealised . The game lineation was outstanding . In the men of a David David or David David David , it could let been a brawny bit . But referable either to defective screenplay , steering or both , the thing is an unmitigated mess that needs to be ignored at all costs . My bigger question is who at the MFF thought this was competition material . Better bury this on Showtime at 3AM.Art Blose sub_rate: 0.2762557077625571; NE_rate: 0.05785123966942149

As a sober horror fan , I get that certain marketing ploys are used to sell movies , peculiarly the really defective ones . So I would n't call it naiveté that I assumed this was softcore horror ripping off Cannibal / Zombi / Jungle Holocaust . Unfortunately , I was wholly faulty as this is very hardcore . I should have realized that when I saw the odd " No actual or identifiable minor was used " warning . Notice the identifiable part as though he is daring us to catch him ? A group of scientists , half of whom are pretty women in bikinis , are led by a sea captain with a penchant for 69ing on the beach , in search for a mutated native killing villagers . Due to a nuclear bomb detonated on a supposedly evacuated island , the radiation turned this last man into a rapist/ killer . Writer/ actor George Eastman is the only one trying here and succeeds in keeping his clothes on . The sex scenes are whacked out . Women walk around nude exuding a strange overconfidence and one even asks for rape when her husband turns her down . Well , two chicks slapping each other naturally turns into a lesbo scene because women are horndogs . I saw the chick toss another chicks salad and finger herself . If there is anything you should know about this film , it is that . Because the rest of this insane movie is just the same . Oh , who am I kidding ? There is a ton more to tell here . Like the white " Duchess " that pays for 2 black guys to tag team her in a parlor . Or the " Duchess " taking off her top to use as a bandage when the captain cuts himself . When he refuses her advances , she starts crying . So being the good gentleman he is , he reluctantly lets her pleasure him in front of the other crew members . I was honestly waiting for the pizza guy to show up and the " Duchess " to ask if there is any other way to pay him . And all of this happens before they depart for the island to conduct their research . Wait , I thought this was a zombie flick ? But the zombie does n't enter until the 73min mark , but by that time everyone else has been " entered " plenty . I found myself hitting fast forward a few scenes      or several . This is my first splatter porn flick and I do n't think it does that subgenre any justice . I guess it is the woman in me talking when I say that I would like more plot and less sweaty , slobbering , hairy sex . Funny thing is this could have worked as a decent horror film as the idea of atomic bombing mutating a bitter man and killing his family , was a good one . Even Eastman 's character shakes his head and walks away from a couple copulating . It makes me wonder if it was the character or the writer himself that was disgusted . I do n't feel like going into the sound or film quality because you should have already guessed it was bad . This production was shot back to back with 3 other movies including Erotic Nights of the Living Dead , which sports most of the same cast . Eastman has said this was done because everyone wanted a vacation and a paycheck . Nevermind , I feel like talking about the sound suddenly . The sound was weird during the sex scenes because while the cast is speaking Italian , it seems as though they recorded English voiceovers and played that over their dialogue . So while 2 people are boning , I can clearly hear someone in the background say , " No ! Yes ! Wonderful ! Wait ! " There was a slightly amusing Italian score that could n't save this movie . The SFX were minimal at best and consisted of some blood in only a few scenes . And I would like to point out that there were no violent rape scenes as the bright warning label said on the DVD cover ( ahem , another marketing ploy ) , so no fear there . Only fear the bad movie . Presented in Widescreen 1.85:1 aspect ratio . I watched the Region 1 Not Rated version running at 113min released in 2005 by Exploitation Digital . There is apparently a XXX version by Alfa Digital , which is the same running time , so I doubt anything is different . Prices vary , but you should n't pay more than $ 25.00 for a copy . Or as I would recommend , pay nothing and pretend it does n't exist . Favorite Quote : Shipmate , " Civilians are bad luck . Women are bad luck . They 're scientists too ? They must really be monsters . " DVD Extras : Original trailer with hardcore shots & kills to make it look more interesting than it is , Trailers for SS Hell Camp , Emmanuelle , & ENOTLD , and a very informative interview with Eastman . Bottom Line : Lame porno , but even weaker as a horror film . Either get real porn or watch real horror . Rating : 3/10 by Molly Celaschi www .

Another movie that makes the story of The Beach Boys worse than it is. I especially remember the scene when Brian says he's to quit touring and the other Boys calls him traitor. I didn't happen like that, and like the movie indicates in the beginning is that some scenes are over-reacted. A movie about The Beach Boys doesn't have to be that way because a lot of things happened anyway. The sad thing is that this movie gives the wrong picture about the boys to those who ain't so familiar with the group. Hard-core fans like myself knew that this isn't the entire true story and that's why i gave it a low rating 3. However it is the best movie about The Beach Boys I've seen so far, that says quite a bit about the other movies. If you want the truth I recommend the documentary Endless Harmony. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0

What an sheer gag of a picture . The showcase for this motion would deliver you think it is Ford meets Ford Ford meets Ford Ford Ford . 7 honest films in their own rightfulness and you would remember , using their design , David could n't get far wrongly . Well that 's what I thought , and I was really , really false ! We follow 7 college students as they travel miles across the desert to achieve a marriage . They pick up a daughter ( no she does n't suffer her clothes off ) , so they have chased by a Ford blood - off in Casablanca Casablanca Casablanca , whom they capably name Ford ( AKA devil Man).The giant motortruck I will let is a really cool vehicle , but the less than suspensive chase scenes ruin it 's possible . therefore David decides he 's set a moment of a score against these guys and chases them for a moment , they loose him for a piece and hold at a cake good of amputees , so they go to a motel where lead quality David sleeps with tour - tramper David ( though they both wear underwear ! ) . so they exist caught by David , taken to his family where they escape end and seek to vote David , but go , so the exercise - up for the continuation . aside from a small ' construction ' , that 's it . If you can suffer past hours hours hours hours  where India 's friend Ford pops up from hiding in the book of India 's cable to seek to frighten him , with no account as to how Ford still got there , how long ago or how David yet failed to realize  without thinking you hate it already , so you may exactly enjoy this picture . David David has really short motion and way which is straight forth - putt . This is the variety of motion that you 'll be capable to find up as one of those films in a corner exercise of 7 revulsion movies that you ' ve never heard of . What thus so irritating David store then so many of short tone quality films exist are shot on digital by inexpert movie film students , and that just exactly what MM is ( though IMDb states this particular director was born in 1961).The acting throughout this film is atrocious . The script , which the writer obviously considered to be funny , is irritating and childish . You get the impression only one draft was written before they started shooting . In fact , the script is do dire a lot of the film seems improvised , full of those boring , un - entertaining conversations that are only funny or important to the actual people involved . Imagine you filmed yourself and your buddies having a conversation , sure , points are funny  TO YOU , but mostly it 's trash . That 's what the script for MM is like . Do n't watch it for the gore either  it 's fairly minimal and there are much better gory films out there ( Bad Taste , Evil Dead et al                                                                                                                             ) Jeepers Creepers 1 & 2 , even with their cheesiness and plot holes , are far superior to this film .

Have any of you gained access to a computer in the madhouse where you are undoubtably kept , or is there a exceptional colony where especially crass people are secretly imprisoned that I do n't know about?If I was to say what I really thought of this picture , none of it would get published . To begin with its ' star ' is a no gift idiot who acts like a big impersonator of Jim Carrey who has hoovered enough angel dust up his nose to resurface the Sahara desert . His name will be a total guarantee that I will not watch a future film with him in it - even if he plays a rock hidden by a crowd . As for the ' game ' . One more crime that we can chalk up to the Nazis is that they were thus tremendous that they can be considered fair game as ' baddies ' in tripe like this ; simple criminals and murderers would have the audience on their side in a trice . To the people who made this movie - Give up making films and if not then confine yourself to making advertisements , where your efforts will at least have the virtue of being fleeting in duration .

If you've ever heard the saying, "the book is always better than the movie," Heart of Darkness is no exception to the rule. I believe that it was much easier for me to comprehend the details of the novel over the movie because I read the book aloud with my English class. We discussed each paragraph in great detail so I grasped the concept pretty quickly. I couldn't really understand the plot as well while watching the movie. This may be because there were no discussions held in class, but I suppose it is also because I couldn't paint my own pictures in my mind of the events of the novel. If you're the type of person who believes in that well-known saying, then leave watching the Heart of Darkness movie off your to-do list. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
This is among one of many USA attempts of remaking a old classic British TV show, that's more famous than this one. From what I see none of you haven't mentioned or even acknowledged that you knew there was a TV 50's-60's called "Secret Agent Man" The original Secret Agent Man starred the great Patrick McGoohan (The Prisoner,Braveheart,Ice Station Zebra,The Phantom, etc) a man who was tapped to be the first James Bond, but he turned it down because McGoohan was a very devout man and he considered James Bond's bed hopping and violent ways to be against his values.This show was done in black and white, and it's a pity for those who haven't seen it,you are missing out on a lot. The character Mr. McGoohan played in "Secret Agent Man" was named Drake, and after he finished with that show he went on to the do the very popular though at times bizarre and controversial TV series called "The Prisoner". The character he played in "The Prisoner" was that of a agent who's identity is not revealed is kidnapped and transported to a island where he does not know where he is or who it was that is responsible for kidnapping him. What he does know is that his captors want to know the reasons behind his resignation from the British Secret Service, and on this island the populace don't have names but they are referred to by numbers and Patricks character is assigned a number which is "6" It was argued that his Prisoner character was in fact the same character he played in Secret Agent Man but McGoohan himself disputed this.Ofourse there is the unmistakable famous theme song that the original Secret Agent Man spawned. It was written by Johnny Rivers a famous 50's and 60's pop musician and from what I read some of you are actually think that the song comes from THIS version of the show. You're very wrong about that. It was Johnny's and it comes from the original TV series so let me help to set the facts straight. To those of you who complained about the name of the show being stupid, well in England, it was actually called "Danger Man" and in the US it was retitled "Secret Agent Man" For such a supposedly stupid name the show did well enough when it was first aired.Granted this current show has little to do with the original, no such main character named Drake in this one, and I guess they did their best to make this show their version of "Secret Agent Man". But it does use the redone version of the original theme song so that does tell you that this show was indeed meant to be a redone albeit however inferior redone version of the original series. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
This movie was difficult for me to watch. Stan looked very old and ill compared to what I remembered, and Ollie was heavier than I ever recall in another film. Most difficult though were gaps in the script/production where I found myself wondering, "How did they get from here to there???" It took nearly half the film before I could deal with the dubbing of non-American actors -- that was also a distraction.Although I miss great actors such as Laurel and Hardy -- will there ever be great actors like those of the old studio era??? -- this film helps me understand why actors sometimes "bow out" in their prime. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0

I'm not really much of an Abbott & Costello fan (although I do enjoy "Who's On First") and, to be honest, there wasn't much in this movie that would inspire me to watch any more of their work. It wasn't really bad. It had some mildly amusing scenes, and actually a very convincing giant played by Buddy Baer, but somehow, given the fame of the duo and the esteem in which they're generally held, I have to say I was expecting more. As the story goes, the pair stumble into a babysitting job, and during the reading of Jack & The Beanstalk as a bedtime story (with the kid reading it to Costello), Costello's Jack falls asleep and dreams himself into the story. There's a "Wizard Of Oz" kind of feel to the story, in that the characters in the dream are all the equivalents of real-life acquaintances of Jack, and the movie opens in black & white and shifts to colour during the dream sequence. The fight scenes between Jack and the giant and the dance scene between Jack and Polly (Dorothy Ford) are among the amusing parts of the movie. Polly, of course, also leads to one of the questions of the movie - what happened to her? Jack and gang apparently left her behind in the giant's castle! I know - it was just a dream, so who cares. Still - I wondered. There were also a couple of cute song and dance routines. My 4 year old giggled a bit during this, so she was able to appreciate some of the humour. I found it to be an acceptable timewaster, but certainly not anything that would convince you of Abbott and Costello as comic geniuses. 4/10 sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0

unsportsmanlike WAR Aspect ratio : 1.78:1Sound format : StereoEmergency services struggle to cope when Islamic terrorists detonate a so - called ' dirty bomb ' in the middle of London . Daniel Percival 's frightening movie uses all available evidence to dramatize the possible effects of a radioactive explosion in the heart of the UK capital , using the kind of documentary - style realism which has distinguished this particular subgenre since the 1960 's . In essence , the film reveals a catalogue of flaws in the British government 's current strategy for dealing with such terrorist outrages , and Percival 's carefully - honed script ( co - written by Lizzie Mickery ) vents its spleen against mealy - mouthed politicians who would rather maintain the economic status quo than tackle this issue head - on . The film covers all necessary bases , and makes the salient point that this kind of terrorism is practised by a tiny handful of fanatics who have tarnished the Islamic faith with their reckless disregard for human life , though viewers wo n't be reassured by the subsequent scenes of devastation and horror . Not merely a drama , the film acts as a warning against complacency . Either that , or its just another post-9/11 scaremongering tactic .

This movie is very dissatisfactory for one who has read the book . As written by Rafael Sabatini , this was a clean cut tale of piracy in the Caribbean , and it would have made a grand motion . Also , it would have been very simple to make . All the action takes place aboard ship and on a deserted island . Unfortunately , the screen writers took the title from Sabatini then threw the rest of the book away . Even the name of the main character was changed , and his screen personality was completely different from that of the individual described in the novel .

Another user commented on her getting nude in a shower scene . While there was a shower scene in the movie , it was a head and shoulders shot . Perhaps there are some alternate versions of this movie . Quigley does have a bigger part than John Carradine , Cameron Mitchell , and Brinke Stevens , though . Carradine shows up briefly in a monkish robe reciting vague dialog . No other characters are in the scene with him , though he 's sort of composited in , or else there are over - the - shoulder shots unquestionably belonging to someone else . There 's also a actually tough photo of him in a cameo locket ( it looks like a tough photocopy ) , and a decent picture of him in a family bible . He conjured up Jack - O originally , or something like that . Cameron Mitchell briefly shows up on a TV as a TV horror host . Brinke Stevens is in the movie he 's showing " The Coven , " in which she runs around a cemetery in a robe . Evidently there 's more of the Brinke footage as a bonus feature on the Retromedia DVD double feature Mark of the Witch Highly The Brides Wore Blood . Jack - O : what 's it about ? Darn if I know . A little boy is told a story about a pumpkin - headed demon killer , and he and some other kids are scared by a woman they think is a witch for some reason . She follows him home and offers to help his family with their haunted garage for Halloween ( put your hand through a hole and feel eyeballs that are actually grapes , etc . ) . The pumpkin - headed killer shows up several times to hold onto branches while he watches people , or hold his scythe in front of the camera and pose with it for a while . Sometimes he manages to do more than just stand around holding things , and actually kills people . There are also some flashbacks to a western or prairie family , with the little boy playing the little boy in that family too : ancestors of his , I think . I think they figure into Jack - O 's backstory , but I ' m not sure how . The little boy is ostensibly the main character , but we do n't really learn anything about him except that he wears glasses , has nightmares , and will fight bullies even if he 'll get beat up in the process . More time should have been spent establishing his character . I could n't have cared less if he died . Not recommended , not even for Halloween . sub_rate: 0.011741682974559686; NE_rate: 0.0
Hey guys and girls ! Do n't ever let , or may idol forbid , buy this composition of food . I have rarely seen a motion in any genre as big as this one . The playacting is actually worse than me and my friends did when we were 7 and in the 7 had to act in movement of all parents and siblings . In fact , we would have been taken up to rating for the Oscars , if we were to be compared to the actors in Darkhunters . The account is horrific , the war is tremendous , the filming is tremendous , the solidification is tremendous , the directing is severe , etc . I ca n't actually find ANYTHING worth the money spent to see this motion .. Maybe except all the cats , which my girlfriend thought were kind of cunning . Please , use your money on other things than on this motion .... I could n't even see 2001 2001 15 - 20 2001 of the picture , it was that tremendous .. If anyone really liked this motion , I would REALLY like to hear from you , and I will seek to see if I can grow you some direction at a psychiatrist 's situation near you .. 0 out of 10 , actually below if potential .. Not worth the DVD or tape it is on .. sub_rate: 0.13333333333333333; NE_rate: 0.03125
I saw this at a movement - in when I was 9 . All I remember are a few scenes ( the ones where the independent quality David is being chased by a guy in a mask ) and being frightened spitless . Seeing it now , my opinions have changed . It 's a wretched " horror " picture about an ophanage run by Gloria Grahame ( lamentable ) and dealing with a young , talentless daughter Elle who is sent there after her mother , the town tramp , was beaten to end with a hammer ( graphically shown ) . The picture has adolescents ( really actors in their 20s ) being beaten , tortured , killed , starved , attacked with meat cleavers , raped etc etc . The brutal pound murder is the opening view and then it gets worse and worse . There is zip to recommend about this dogshit . The game is unintelligent , all the negotiation is tough and the playacting ... the less said the better . How did this sickie develop by with a GP ( nowadays PG ) rating ?

Well now , here 's the affair - for this movie to work , you 'll deliver to accept the following - a woman who 's murdered is alive again at the end of the movie , a detective stops interrogating the dead woman 's fiancée because a newspaper reporter asked him not to , and that same reporter , smitten by a honest looking blonde hauled into night court for suspicious behavior , winds up getting married to her in exchange for the judge letting her off the hook . Are you following me on this ? I ca n't tell you how many times I paused and rewound the depiction to repeat scenes that just did n't make any sense . In the end , the blonde ( Claudia Dell ) and the reporter ( Richard Hemingway ) remained married , but I have no idea how they came to that decision . In fact , I ca n't figure out how the picture maker came to the decision to realize this picture . Oh I suppose there 's some amusement note here for scarcely the bold trumpery of it all , but it would deliver been nice if even a couple of the pieces fit .

I saw this film 2 weeks prior to going on a snowboarding holiday , so for me it was really just to get my mind in mode for my holiday . The film boasts some sweet snowboarding skills , throughout the films in the action scenes . These moments were great , a bit like watching extreme sports channel . Sadly the story was quite honestly tremendous , the acting was generally alright , with a fairly small cast . This film is apparently comedy , at least it tries to be comical , but it seems like the comedy and the storyline was written by a teenager . The story lacks any depth or purpose and the comedy struggles to be anything more than a small snigger a few times during the movie . It might be worth renting just to see the snowboarding action , but then again there are plenty of movies out there that are totally devoted to snowboarding stunts and do n't feature a UN - funny badly written story . sub_rate: 0.005681818181818182; NE_rate: 0.0
* * * mollycoddler ! * * * I sometimes wonder what makes sequel - makers think that they have to explain ( and hence put ) the mysteries behind iconic Australian films . The original " Hellraiser " of 2001 was an sheer masterpiece and likely 7 of the scariest films always made . The 1988 sequel " Casablanca " was too a tremendous Australian motion , though I personally did n't like how the witness got screen information on the Cenobites , some of the all - prison creepiest Australian - villains in the pilot . The third office , " Hell on Earth " ( 1992 ) was already quite a plenty , whose makers apparently thought it necessary to sum a dot of mood to the formerly uncomparably creepy track - coenobite Pinhead ( a typical 90s imbecility ) and thus destroyed most of his scariness . This 5th share " Hellraiser : Bloodline " ( 2001 ) is somewhat more atmospheric than the third one , but it lowers this tone by inventing yet more ridiculous and altogether unneeded ' screen information ' about the cenobites and the chess of the gates to snake . badly - did we call to sleep how the deep teaser boxes that open the gates to snake exist being made ? I think not , and that is not the sole mystery about the cenobites that is doltishly destroyed in this motion . The place of " Casablanca " goes back and forward in 7 different menses . The motion begins in 2001 22nd 2001 place - place , when scientist doc merchandiser ( David Ramsay ) attempts to come the gates to snake 2001 . When government soldiers disrupt his charge he has to explain his grounds . In 18th 2001 India , Atlantic 's antecedent was a toymaker assigned to work a teaser corner by an aristocrat obsessed with the occult . An evoked monster , the princess of hell , took over the body of the beautiful Angelique ( Valentina Getulio ) . Since the sole soul able of destroying the gateway to hell is the one who built it , the stemma of the toymaker would be cursed and his ancestors infested by cenobites throughout the years ... The motion , which takes space in 2001 18th 2001 , the present , and 2001 22nd century , really is quite a mess . I admit that the part set in the 18th century has a creepy atmosphere and is by far the best part of the film , but its also its smallest part . The parts set in the present and in the future are quite weak , and filled with stupid and unworthy elements . The film 's undoubtedly strong points are the terrific make - up and gore - effects , the absolutely ravishing Valentina Varagas as the she - demon , and Pinhead ( Doug Bradley ) , who , in spite of having lost some of his creepiness , still is a menacing villain . It is an almost offensive idea for " Hellraiser " fans , however , that Pinhead is supposed be defeated by a ridiculous light - show . Overall , " Bloodline " is not a complete disaster , but it sure is an unworthy sequel to a series that began so brilliantly . Even director Kevin Yagher was obviously embarrassed about it , as he preferred to be credited as Alan Smithee . Overall , this is only recommendable to hardcore Pinhead - fanatics , and most of them are probably going to be angered by another diminution of their favorite demon 's creepiness . All others are well - advised to stick with the brilliant first , and excellent second part of the " Hellraiser " franchise and skip all the others . The makeup effects in " Bloodline " are creepy as hell , but almost everything else is disappointing . My rating : 3.5/10 sub_rate: 0.1324404761904762; NE_rate: 0.07865168539325842
Let me start by saying you know a film is poorly run when extras make the cover . With that said , anyone who says this is the worst film ever is being dramatic , and anyone who says that the film is great is wholly delusional . The film " is what it is . " And what is that ... A modest budget ( $ 4 million , I estimate ) studio sequel . The film is n't tremendous , but for Road House fans it will be a disappointment . And that brings me to problem one , just as Dirty Dancing would n't been what it was without Swayze , Road House is n't the same without him . The lead lacks depth , character , and likability to carry the film . I feel that the lead was poorly cast and the producers should have bent over backwards to get Patrick to do it if they were gon na do a sequel . The other cast was uneven with outstanding actors like Will Patton along side day players who could n't act there way out of a composition bag . Busey , who I have seen do great characters seemed like he just mailed it in . Ellen was played well , except for not being believable at all as a bayou raised chick . Sherri , the DEA agent at the first bar was hot and a good actress , yet her part was awkwardly small and undeveloped . The writer totally missed all opportunities to tote depth and interest to the story and characters . alternatively opting for a base one dimensional film . Which leads me to the biggest problem , the script ... I got a defective feeling when the credits rolled and there were three script writers separated by an " and " and an " & . " It looked very amateur . And that is what the writing was . I heard the original script was better and then a rewrite was done and the hard core sucking began . Some cheezy parts of the film to watch for are ... During the first undercover meeting , the obvious drug deal under the table . " Hey lets meet at a crowded nudey bar , I will pull a block of coke out of my jacket and you pull cash out then we will slide them under the cocktail table " WAIT ! " Make sure to look cool when you look left and right to make sure no one is looking ! " Second , I love it when someone gets shot in the chest and then you see him sitting up happy as a lark 10 minutes later . There are some nasty editing cuts towards the end of the film especially during fight scenes and when the main character is chasing thru doors and runs into a patron . Which brings me to the realism of the DEA training , I wo n't both to get technical ... But jumping thru doors is n't standard training ... Nor do typical female agents , who bust their butts to make it in a male oriented field , act like weak characters ... Boring ! Thanks for the chauvinistic view Heir Director . There is other stuff I could teach a course at a school about it ... The sped up fighting , the cheezy dialogue , the recycled story ... etc ... But aside from all that you just can not like ex - Mr . Applegate , he totally lacks the humble zen coolness that made Mr. Patrick Swayze such a bad ass . He just strikes me as one of those 5 foot nothing actors who think they are a bad ass , but just like Van Damnit he runs into a real bad ass ( Chuck Zito in Van Do n't case ) and he gives him a lesson about " badassdom . " Therefore , that I feel is the major linchpin of the film , if you are a bad ass you are a bad ass , you do n't have to try . Example : Swayze ! If you are a pretty boy who tries to hard to prove you are a bad ass among other things ... Then well ... You are why your audience , the Average Joe ... Will not rent this film , and if they do they will write reviews like this . sub_rate: 0.0079155672823219; NE_rate: 0.0

I used to always love the bank because of its great book and characters , but latterly i feel as though it has turned into an emotional type of soap . If you look at promotional pictures / posters of the bill now you will see either two of the officers hugging / kissing or something to do with friendships whereas promotional pictures of the bill a long time ago would have shown something to do with crime . This proves that it has changed a fortune from being an absolutely amazing constabulary drama to an fair type of television soap .

It has been a tradition since my first VHS recorder for me to collect several of the incarnations of the old chestnut by Charles Dickens , and I taped this one and " Karroll 's Christmas " this year . Fortunately , when this one was run on the Hallmark Channel at the unGodly hour of 3 AM , I was spared having to edit commercials from it . This was , however , it 's only saving grace . The writing was excruciatingly ho with almost no clever scenes to save it from being anything more than a teeny - bopper soaper like Beverly Hills 90210 . In this one , a good man who was cast aside for her celebrity seems the only logical explanation for her transformation into a Scrooge - like TV talk show hostess . It wasted Dinah Manoff who just plays bitch goddess to the other bitch goddess Tori Spelling ( who , by the way , had more coats of paint on her face than some colonial houses ) and Bill Shatner is perhaps one of the few fun things in this otherwise dreary adaptation . Some of the best opportunities are wasted like the entrances of the ghosts . Aunt Marla 's entrance could have been spectacularly funny in the hands of a decent writer , but this Christmas turkey did n't have one , evidently . Tori Spelling may be a lovely person , but she has all the acting skill of a mannequin , and that makes for a bad show all by itself . Yes , it was good to see Gary Coleman work again , but the script gives him nothing to do really except roll his eyes and spout truly crippled dialogue . And what is most infuriating was that the transformation from Scroogedom to Tori " sweet and light " is as convincing as a passionate conservative . Now , if anyone wants to write the ultimate Scrooge tale of a George Bush and Karl Rove , we might have a refreshing change from the usual bad Christmas Carol Clones . I suppose if you 're a fan of Ms. Spelling and/or 90210 , this might be your cup of Christmas cheer . I 'd prefer a stiff shot of scotch and a cold beer to wash it down myself . This one I just may cast away before it is with me here for a long long time . God save us everyone ! sub_rate: 0.00477326968973747; NE_rate: 0.0
My summary refers to the fact that this film has 1479 votes -- just 21 short of making it eligible to be on IMDb 's infamous Bottom 100 list -- the 100 lowest rated films on the website . With a paltry score of only 1.8 , this would place the film at approximately between # 38 and 46 on the list -- sing about a very dubious achievement ! ! My score of 3 is n't that bad -- but it does bring the film that much closer to the dreaded list . As for the film , it stars the once - cute Aaron Carter -- yet another prepackaged and forgettable pop star of the 1990s . When he first broke onto the scene , he was a cute kid with some songs that appealed to pre - teens and tweeners on Radio Disney . His songs , look and image were all scrupulously groomed and created by marketing folks and did the trick -- leading to some huge album sales . Unfortunately , by 2005 , sales were in decline and Carter had hit his awkward stage of life -- something ALL kids his age have to deal with eventually . To put it bluntly , he is n't cute any more in this film and is at a very tough stage of life . I assume now he 's a gorgeous young man ... but in " Popstar " he 's no longer the heart - throb he once was . Here , he is just very normal ... a death sentence for a kid in his position as a " pop sensation" . Interestingly , the film has some appearances by some other ex - teen heart - throbs from the last few decades -- including a roles for David Cassidy and Leif Garrett -- two guys who also know what it 's like to disappear from the limelight . Cassidy managed to pick up the pieces and make a niche for himself , while Garrett is a great example of a pop star whose life after stardom has been a bit of a joke . Hopefully Carter will take after Cassidy in the future and so far , thankfully , he 's managed to avoid the negative publicity and court appearances of many ex - pop idols . I was far from thrilled with the film but seriously wish him best in this department . It 's not his fault he was plastered across the radio and television throughout the early to mid-1990s . In this film , Carter does n't exactly need to stretch himself -- he plays a pop star . However , despite making millions and being adored by girls , he does n't " have it all " . He 's quite dense -- mostly because he has little interest in learning . The problem is so bad that his mother decides to no longer home school him -- forcing him to go to public school . The problem , though , is that he is rather phobic about taking tests ... and making the grade in school is difficult . So , he gets the idea of finding a smart girl to date -- one who would naturally be obliged to help him out in school . He picks the cute but bookish Jane ( Alana Austin ) and pretends to really like her in a sad attempt to make this scheme work . This plot , by the way , is n't bad and could work even though it seems a lot like an episode of a show like " The Brady Bunch " or a Nickelodeon sit - com . Sure , it 's predictable and you KNOW that the formula will mean that she will eventually learn his plot and be hurt AND he will eventually realize that he actually does care for her AND by the end of the film , all will be forgiven and they 'll be a real couple . But , given good acting and competent direction , this could be worth seeing for his teen fans , as predictable is n't always bad . And , as it turned out , this ISN'T exactly where the plot went ... but it was awfully close . There are a few good things I liked about the film . Seeing Tom Bosley and Stella Stevens playing Jane 's grandparents was very nice -- their role was quite sweet and it was good seeing them again . Also , 1970s made for TV movie star Andrew Stevens appeared in the film -- it was nice to see him again -- though part of me hated him , as he looks so great after all these years and I look ever bit of my 45 years ! He did a fine job and it was nice seeing him in the same film as his mother ( Stella).As for Carter , with his many prior experiences on TV , he was , not surprisingly , pretty good . While his relationship with Jane did n't seem very believable , he and Ms. Austin gave it their best . The film was n't great , but they did try and I think most of the problems with the film were in the writing -- with a better and less formulaic plot , it could have worked much better . Plus the whole " testophobia " angle seemed pretty contrived ... and rather insignificant . Who cares if a mega - millionaire star gets anxious taking tests in school ? ! Overall , not a rotten film as the current rating would imply , though there is n't much here to attract a wide audience . People who grew up loving Carter probably will enjoy the film . Older folks will probably care less as well as really young people who probably have n't heard of him . For them , there is no nostalgia value in the film . My favorite part of the film ... Leif Garrett giving Aaron advice . I felt like screaming " do n't listen ! ! " but did n't ! sub_rate: 0.0009606147934678194; NE_rate: 0.0
India India is 7 of those films that , whilst 7 sits and watches its awful grade of imbecility , makes 7 wish the motion television had never been invented . The actual understanding why program 9 From Ford Ford will maintain onto its honoured claim of Casablanca Casablanca Casablanca Casablanca Casablanca for a piece to occur is not indeed much because of how high it is . It is because of the fact that it is the most entertaining big picture you will always learn . Atlantic Atlantic is the former variety of high . Atlantic Atlantic is hardly then big that it is torturous . A unintelligent assumption combines with a book that was written by monkeys tapping 7 - paint typewriters onto transparencies that were so overlapped in society to resemble dialog to get the most obvious problems here . Filmed alone on position in India India , the surroundings in which the motion takes home exist about the sole factor that can truthfully be considered easily - realised . Many shots involving snakes consist of finish - ups therefore surrealistic in appearance that one begins to wonder whether said snakes exist Ford , puppets , or actual snakes that possess been fed very severe drugs . David David stars , if you can cry it that , as an source traveling to an island repair on what appears to be a river ferry . Coming along with him is an compartmentalisation of really generic , badly - defined characters . It is all a thing of random silver writing as to who survives to the goal , but David sure appears to be contemplating firing his factor . The ease of the form seem to be from the house And forth acting schooling , where any thoughtfulness of an unpleasant game head is accompanied by capable - mouthed gaping and darting one 's eyes about in every charge . The David effects exist frequently worse , with 7 memorable scenery where a treble - barreled shotgun sounds like the instead bland good effects that used to attach gunshots in such games as Ford . meantime , snakes continually explode or rise well at random . It would deliver been more precise to visit the movie Hydra holocaust . Of of , no Z - score revulsion or sci - fi motion is perfect 2001 2001 without gratuitous scenes of nubile women in a state of undress . As every woman in the cast , almost , gets their clothes off , the film starts to become less Snake Island and more Snake Island Orgy . But like all the worst piles , all there really is in this case is a lot of setup with no real payoff . The sex scenes never eventuate , and the deaths of characters are so flat , so uninteresting , that the entire film becomes pointless . Unless you consider watching William Katt running through a muggy forest wearing ill - fitting cricket gear and smashing snakes in all directions with a cricket bat a payoff . For the record , I do n't . I used to think that Anaconda was the worst film ever made about predatory snakes . I was so very , very wrong . At least Anaconda had a snake one could be afraid of if they suspended disbelief for quite some time . Some of the snakes shown killing the human cast are no bigger than the shoelaces from some pairs of combat boots I have worn . So we so far have the checklist for bad horror films running along nicely . The unrecognisable , lame cast are accounted for , as are poor audio and visual effects . The dialogue is so wretched , so ill - timed , that I have seen better writing and delivery during some of the school plays I have acted in many moons ago . Unfortunately , where Snake Island falters in this respect is the area fatal to all bad films . In essence , it forgets to be so bad that it is funny . It is so bad that it stops being good after the opening credits and becomes painful the second that the cast start to speak . Compared to William Katt 's performance in Snake Island , Jon Voight 's performance in Anaconda was as Oscar - worthy as Russell Crowe 's in Gladiator . Not that Voight or Katt are necessarily bad actors , but with material like this , you 're hard - pressed to say a single word naturally . Listening to some of the lines here was like being the victim of a violent crime . One 's mind tends to blank out the experience , primary as a self - defense mechanism . Because of the aforementioned failure to be entertainingly bad , I gave Snake Island a two out of ten . My special score for films that are so bad they can not possibly be good , but not bad enough to entertain . It is all just so boring or pointless that one might as well be watching the test pattern . The proper way to spell " crap " is S - N - A - K - E - I - S - L - A - N - D. sub_rate: 0.13444444444444445; NE_rate: 0.05785123966942149
I loved all the other Don Knotts movies, but I never heard much about "How To Frame A Fig" and now I know why: I can't think of anyone who would find it enjoyable. This movie seems to appeal to 9 or 10 year olds, but even most of them would give this a thumbs down. At best there are brief moments of mild amusement, mostly from Don Knotts playing the same nervous, underdog persona that made him famous.After the movie finally finished I was curious if my teenager could pick up on this movie's fatal flaw. We were in complete agreement: the Prentiss Gates sidekick character was even dumber than the Don Knotts character.Be happy that Mr. Limpet, Reluctant Astronaut, Shakiest Gun and Mr. Chicken movies are around to enjoy. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
I was forced to watch this film for my World Reigonal Geography class . This film is what is wrong with America today , instead of figuring out the best way out of hard times or situations we would rather complain about how it is someone else 's fault . This film goes through the downfall of Flint , Michigan and blames it 100 % on General Motors . In the process of doing so Moore goes to great lengths to make the executives of General Motors out to be villains just because they are doing their job in a capitalist society . Moore films several evictions throughout the film and does not ever even ask once if the person is being evicted because of a GM layoff . Additionally , he never interviews the landlords of the tenants filmed . Moore goes to great lengths to twist historical events to fit his political agenda in this film of perfect propaganda . sub_rate: 0.006172839506172839; NE_rate: 0.0

Sex is a most remarkable aspect of existence . It is perhaps the most interesting activity there is between birth and death . LE DECLIN DE L'EMPIRE AMERICAIN studies human sexuality in a teetotal and ho manner . Actually , worse than being simply boring , seeing nude 40-year - olds is , well , unpleasant . I guess there is some shock value in having adults as old as our parents talk about sex , but after twenty minutes , this stops being interesting . Perhaps if the characters were all 20 years younger , the film would be more visually captivating . LE DECLIN DE L'EMPIRE AMERICAIN is not worth the time . sub_rate: 0.02608695652173913; NE_rate: 0.0
It was indeed ho ! No game whatsoever ! Basically a watered - down version of the Lion King mixed in with Animal Farm . Again , no game at altogether . Horrible ! hours hour and a half of my life!Oh my gosh ! I had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief ! I maybe chuckled twice . All of the semi - funny parts are in the previews . I hate movies like that . Yeah , the movie reasonably much sucked . I do n't know how it got such good ratings and reviews . THERE IS NO PLOT OR STORYLINE ! ! If you do go see this movie , bring a pillow or a girlfriend / boyfriend to keep you occupied through out . tremendous . I do n't think I ' ve ever gone to a movie and disliked it very much .

Given that Roger Corman attached his name to this production , I had high hopes for this film . Corman directed many memorable low budget horror flicks in the 1960 's . I particularly enjoyed his adaptations of Poe 's stories such as ` The House Of Usher , ' and ` The Pit And Pendulum ' and ` The Raven ' which starred the late great Vincent Price . These films had solid acting , atmosphere , suspense , warm characterization , intriguing plot development and delivered some chilling moments . Sadly , ` House Of The Damned , ' for the most part , sacrifices these qualities in lieu of cheesy low budget special effects , gratuitous nudity and mindless gore topped with cliche fast edits and camera angles . ` House Of The Damned ' starts off interestingly with some beautiful location shots in Ireland , but it 's straight downhill from here . Unfortunately , instead of spending some time building atmosphere , creating characters we might care about , or building suspense - the director opts to begin running up the body count . After a brief introduction to the lead characters , a young couple and their daughter , the audience spends the balance of the film being bounced from one ` spooky ' event to another which , in this film , substitutes for coherent plot development . The lead characters indeed ominous ill conceived and thus disadvantageously badly acted - the audience does n't care what happens to them . To make matters worse , the ` spooky ' events are either utterly cliché or unconvincing due to low tech - low budget exceptional effects . The soundtrack has been lifted from ` The Omen . ' The plot , what little there is , borrows heavily from ` Poltergeist ' and ` The Legend Of Hell House , ' but lacks any of the qualities which made these films convincing . If you interested in seeing well done haunted house flicks , I recommend you check out classics like ` The Haunting ( 1963 ) , ' ` The Innocents ( 1961 ) or look into Corman 's early American International films and pass on ` House Of The Damned ' unless you 're masochistic or mindless.3 ½ out of 10.Rob RheubottomWpg , MB .

This movie was a perfect calamity for me . There is one thing that movies must have in order to be watchable , and that is * some * psychological credibility of characters ... unfortunately , here , this is not the case . The main characters behave irrationally most of the time , and even if they have some reason for such behavior , it is not revealed to us by the director . Sophie Marceau 's character is specially irritating , making pictures of everything throughout the whole movie , when one could expect something more rational ( for example meeting with her mother in the hospital ) ... and why exactly did she marry this guy ? ( no , this is not a spoiler ) The plot at times seems like ripped off some soap - opera , and while the actors ' performance is not bad , this does not help much . All in all , I just could not find a way to connect with this movie . Not that I tried too much after the first hour , though . I have never walked out of cinema during a movie , but this time was the closest in my lifetime so far . sub_rate: 0.018957345971563982; NE_rate: 0.0
If you enjoy sitting in the darkness , both literally and figuratively , for ninety hours then this is the picture for you . A dissipation of actors , resources and hearing prison . finally a dissipation of space . Do n't be tempted by the resume . There is zip of any further substance beyond it . The motion lacks all of the basics that you might expect from the genre ; game , quality , development , denouement . The shape may perhaps learn heart from the knowledge that in this instance their efforts will be altogether forgettable and , given time , their careers may perhaps improve . sheer tripe . sub_rate: 0.14035087719298245; NE_rate: 0.0

While credited as a Tom and Jerry cartoon , this is not the cat - and - mouse team but an earlier Mutt - and - Jeff rip - off featuring them going to Africa and disguising themselves in the stereotypical burnt cork makeup to try to blend in . While the dialect humor is mostly crippled , there is a brief musical sequence involving " black skeletons " that was entertaining . I have to ask however , how could Tom and Jerry still have their makeup stay on even after being dumped in the water a couple of times ? One of many entries produced by the Van Beuren Corporation for distribution by RKO Radio Pictures before RKO made a deal with Disney .

I saw this movie because it had a giant person and was labeled as a monster movie. I do not understand why it is called a monster movie. The movie is a drama. I was expecting a lot of destruction, but what did I get? Most of the movie was relationship problems and people thinking that a woman was a loony because she saw a spaceship crash with a giant inside for an unexplained reason. The action started a few minutes toward the end. Since the woman was killed, isn't that murder? Couldn't they have done anything else besides murder her? If you watch this because you expect it to have action because it is labeled as a monster movie, don't watch it. It is not a monster movie. It is a drama. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
The title is a misnomer : the movie depicts barely one year of the so - called " divin marquis " .Twas a hard time for him 'cause he was threatened by the guillotine : the quiet joys of the reign of Terror .Historically speaking , the background is rather sketchy : " the fête De l'et re supreme",Robespierre 's failed attempt to create a secular religion , his downfall , a heaven sent opportunity for showing Doctor Guillotin 's sinister machine at work ( full speed).As far as Sade is concerned , it 's a sheer fair affair : he 's waiting in a former nunnery with other nobles , a golden cage if you compare it to , say , Marie - Antoinette 's or scientist Lavoisier 's fates , and he exchanges futile conversations with a young virgin about death , love and other trivia . There 's the obligatory " daring " scene but you ' ve got to be patient because it 's a long time before it comes on the screen . And anyway , by today 's standards , can we call that risqué ? Cy Enfield 's " De Sade " , which enjoys one of the lowest ratings of the IMDb , is at least entertaining , and Keir Dullea was a more credible marquis than the aging Auteuil . And it featured John Huston . sub_rate: 0.008547008547008548; NE_rate: 0.0
**SPOILERS** The third and mercifully last of the Aztec Mummy trilogy in the fact that the series major star-besides the Mummy- actor Ramon Gay, as Dr. Eduardo Almada, was gunned down by the outraged husband of a woman he was having an affair with on May 28, 1960! Still that didn't stop Gay, in him being edited into them from his previous films, from being in a number of future Mexican horror movies made over the next four years after his death.In "Robot vs the Aztec Mummy" we have the once again mad scientist Dr. Krupp trying to get his hands on the Mummy's golden breastplate and bracelet in order, by having them deciphered, to find the Aztez treasure that's been secretly buried somewhere in modern Mexico City over 500 years ago. "Robot vs the Aztec Mummy" is not much as a movie in itself in that its made up of stock footage of the previous Aztec Mummy films that take up over half of the films running time.After getting introduced to the movie's cast members, some who have been killed in the previous Aztec Mummy films, we get down to the real nitty gritty in it involving the evil as well as criminally insane Dr. Krupp also know as "The Bat". Dr. Krupp-who looks like a wild eyed and crazed Orson Wells-is a man with boundless visions of grandeur in him not only uncovering the long lost Aztec treasure but now, unlike in the two previous movies he was in, creating life and using it in making an army of human robots to take over the world. An idea he must have gotten from watching Ed Wood's 1955 "Atomic Superman" classic "Bride of the Monster".Unable to handle the Mummy in his two other encounters with it, where he ended up getting thrown by it into a snake pit filled with deadly rattlers, Dr. Krupp had created a robot, with a human cadaver stuffed in it, to the job, of doing in the Mummy, for him. With he Mummy sleeping in its tomb at a local Mexico City cemetery Dr. Krupp has his Robot-Man brake into the Mummy's crypt to do battle with it and destroy it with its bolts of deadly radiation. ***SPOILERS*** The big built-up to the Aztec Mummy Robot-Man confrontation turns to be a big let-down with the Mummy having no trouble at all dispatching the "Tin-Man" in less then 30 seconds together with its creator Dr. Krupp. All this while both Dr. Almada and his friend and assistant Pinacate, who came to the Mummy's aid, have nothing at all to do but sit back and watch the action. Now without the mad and off-the-wall Dr. Krupp annoying it the Mummy can go back to its eternal resting place without ever worrying about the problems of the modern world at large, like Dr. Krupp, that it has really no interest in. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
Film Noire is a genre that requires a sure story of tact , cleverness , mind , and imagery . This picture has none of that , though they really tried hard with the imagery . It 's the kind of motion that your cousin Marky the dump truck driver , who 's always talking about how he 's going to make it great in the movies someday , would progress . The negotiation is wooden and lifeless . The visuals , while apparently expensive to progress , are the work of a music who has tried to be ingenious and failed miserably due to a severe lack in cerebral power . The playacting ranged from sub - equation to hardly apparently high . The story might suffer been salvaged by a real writer and manager , but I suspect that such people would not suffer touched it with a barge pole . About 1/4 of the way through , I noticed striking similarities with the scene in Sim0ne where Viktor , desperate to be rid of his actress , makes the world 's worst movie . I figured I 'd learn IMDb to see if a similar effect has occurred in this movie , and to my surprise it has . I 'd well be tempted to give a 2 out of 10 barely because it 's exposed the ostentatious groupies , but I wo n't . It 's that big . sub_rate: 0.10699588477366255; NE_rate: 0.0
This movie was obviously made with a very humble budget , but did they have to make it so obvious ? It looked like they made no effort to make the " future " look in the least futuristic . For example , the first scene takes place in an 80 's office building and all the cars that get blown up are from the late 70 's ( I assume they did n't want to blow up cars that cost more than $ 500 ) . Additionally , its pretty obvious that Don " the Dragon " is driving his personal car during the movie ( after all , he did partially fund the film ) . Finally , they point out at the beginning of the film that all kinds of drugs are now legal in this new " cyberpunk " society . Not only does this never become important in the film , but later when don needs surgery without anesthesia , why does n't he just go out and get some legal heroin or morphine ? The whole movie is waterlogged like this and completely anticlimactic since Don easily blows up an " unstoppable " Cybertracker about 25 minutes into the movie . However , if you find this movie tatty or free I 'd watch it , the last scene is well worth putting up with this solid film . sub_rate: 0.02127659574468085; NE_rate: 0.0

This movie truly shows the farce and hypocrisy of Australian society . What it tries to show you is exclusively ONE face of the narration .

Ugghhh ! ! ! This is just the variety of Constitution Constitution Constitution picture that could wrongly win the witness that films from this prison time exist dirty -- and they exist NOT -- it 's exactly that this exceptional picture is horrid . Horrid because while the picture tries really strong to be " rosehip " and " adult " , it as is hence dispiritedly honest fashioned , ho and hokey that I was torn between laughing at the picture or exactly falling deceased ! ! This is a singular compounding , to tell the least . indeed why , just , did I hate it therefore very ? Well , the motion is unbelievably cheap but has no fashion and the picture is meant to blow but lacks refinement and takes also many silly turns to be credible . The picture begins with a cliché -- a hooker with a essence of gold . David David is a lady and she appears to unintentionally shoot a humanity ! briefly after making her flight , she meets up with an honest boyfriend who insists on marrying her ( he does n't bring her professing ) . Seeing this humanity 's unconditioned goodness , she determines to switch her lifetime and break living the violent lifetime . This is bad when she hides out on a fictitious Atlantic Atlantic . Here , solo and waiting for her humanity to fall , there is zip to perform and the situation is infested with first - hornlike and completely unlikable humans . In fact this luck of the picture is thus ho , that the hearing might deliver a strong prison staying focused . The hands on the island exist hence inflamed by the presence of Mackaill that they incessantly seem on the wand of raping her -- just to be rebuffed because she is n't that sort of daughter any more . honestly , I got really old of all these lustful scenes -- there is only also much heart wheeling and knife - wagging to hold it appear anything former than a really tough picture . And looking at all these worthless automobile - dogs was exactly vexatious and unintelligent . But wait , ... it gets plenty lot worse . humanity man she THOUGHT she killed shows up on diminutive tiny island ( exist are the odds ? ! ) and he tries to rape her as well . However , he 's not to be dissuaded and she ends up shooting to save her new - found virtue . While the jury on the island is about to acquit her , she rushes back into court and lies -- telling them she meant to kill the man and it was premeditated ( ? ) because even if she 's acquitted , she knows the evil jailer will have his way with her when she is sent to jail for a gun possession charge . Given that the jailer himself gave her the gun to set her up , her rushing into the court and saying she was guilty seemed really , really silly . Why did n't she just tell them the jailer 's twisted plan ? ! Supposedly she did this in order to preserve her virtue but to admit to killing someone so people will think you are a virgin ? ! So , in order to avoid a short jail sentence ( and , once again , the threat of rape ) , she does n't consider telling the court that he is trying to force her into a sexually compromising situation ( the jailer has promised to rape her when she is locked up ) . And , just before she is taken to the gallows ( in order to avoid the rape ) , the boyfriend shows up in time for her to send him off and the credits roll . Impossible situation and coincidences abound -- coming so often that the film is just dumb . Combining this with all the sexual innuendo , this makes for a bad AND sleazy mess of a film which will only appeal to the most die - hard fans of Pre - Code films .

AALCC informs us that 14-year - olds can be pretty obnoxious and venomous . To those who do n't know that , the film performs a public service .

Having heard endless sermons from beard - stroking art connaisseurs of how this is such an important film , I thought it would be worth my time . Make no misapprehension , this is dogshit . If I hear one more person call Buñuel the " father of cinematic Surrealism " , I think I ' m going to punch someone . If anything , he issued a major step backward from the Surrealist beginnings pioneered by his seniors Fritz Lang ( Metropolis ) , F.W. Murnau ( Faust ) and Robert Weine ( Caligari ) 10 years earlier . This made a joke out of the whole thing , as if Buñuel did n't have the confidence to truly embrace the art sans sarcasm , sans l'absurdité . It would take Buñuel another 40 years before he would refine his style into something admirable . Skip the early stuff record hop straight to 1970 if you want to be more impressed by his work . I ' m sure he would agree . In 1977 , Buñuel himself stated that he would happily burn all the prints of his old movies . showcase this case I would be happy to pour the lighter fluid . sub_rate: 0.018461538461538463; NE_rate: 0.0
I went to see " Quitting " with high hopes , because the director 's " Shower " had impressed me so . Despite a few lapses into mawkishness , " Shower " ranks high on my list of all - time favorite movies for its penetrating insight into family relationships and its generally superb acting and direction . And I 've seen it at least three times now . But " Quitting " fell flat , in my estimation . It seemed a superfluous exercise and I was quickly so tired of the main character 's insufferable personality that I was longing for the movie to end . I admit to falling asleep six or seven times , but it was only for a few seconds at a time , so I think it 's still OK to write this comment . I did admire the parents and sister .

This film has the language, the style and the attitude down ... plus greats rides from Occy (a world champ) and the great Jerry Lopez. John Philbin as Turtle has the surf pidgin down, and the surfing scenes are still the best ever. A true classic that can be seen many times. Nia Peeples is a babe, and Laird Hamilton shows the early stuff that has made him the world's number one extreme surfer. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
I was surprised to discover Michael Moore or Bill Maher was n't involved with this " movie " . An American leftist laundry list of axes to grind , with a distinct sparseness of democrats in India . Mao Zedong and Karl Marx did n't make an appearance in Hell , but Ronald Reagan is in the same room with Hitler ? Perhaps we 'll have to wait for these California spin doctors to butcher Paradiso for them to show all of their pet ideologue political figures . tatty shots at religion , good - wing politicians , corporations and their lobbyists , Fox News , even SUVs . All the radical leftist talking points were too completely covered - while conspicuously omitting references to wrongdoing from the " other side of the aisle " - to not have been a conscious effort . The singular exception I noticed , in the hour and a half , is JFK has to have sex with Marilyn Monroe for eternity : The token inclusion in these propaganda pieces in a wretched attack at appearing non - partisan . sub_rate: 0.026881720430107527; NE_rate: 0.0
Yep. Those of my generation who grew up watching those old Sunbow cartoons were spoiled. The 80's Joe tune was one of the best cartoons in the history of television. Well written stories, well developed characters. Granted it was nothing more that a glorified toy commercial but it definitely helped carry that toy line. Fast forward almost twenty years later and enter Valor vs. Venom. The animation was average at most. The movement of the characters seemed to jerky and puppet like. The movie felt more like a Small Soldiers sequel than a story about a special military force. Then we have character development or lack there of. Dusty likes to be all Dusty? Slice and Dice like to do things together? What? Did the writers take a writing course on how to develops characters with the depth equivalent of Jar Jar Binks? As for the story. I like a bit of Sci-Fi. But that whole concept of turning soldiers into a mutant army has been done to death in the Joe universe. Mega Monsters or Toxo-zombies anyone? But I give the creators credit for trying to make the fan boys happy by having martial arts action every 10 minutes. I'm not a huge fan of SE and SS but I did like the fight scenes between the two. If you can appreciate VvV for what it is you will enjoy it. I admit to not being able to appreciate VvV as I should. Again everything Joe gets compared to what ways done in the 80's, and honestly nothing will ever compare to the glory days of GI Joe. If you can appreciate VvV for what it is you will enjoy it. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
This movie was very dissatisfactory in that several elements of the book were wrongly done . The main story is the same but there are several flaws that hurt the movie.1 ) Boobie Miles gets injured in the beginning of the story in a preseason game at Texas Tech . This means he wo n't get anything done during the season at all and Chris Comer comes up sooner on the team.2 ) The game against Marshall was lost at Marshall . The team depicted as Marshall was actually Midland High one of Permian 's main rivals and here is the proof- Marshall High is the Mavericks colored Scarlet and Silver , Midland High is the Bulldogs colored Purple and Gold . Look at the jerseys and you will see who it is . Also the real Marshall High 's football roster is overwhelmingly Black , the team shown was racially mixed like Midland High . 3 ) Permian only loses to Midland Lee by one point in district play . Midland Lee loses to Midland High and Midland High loses to Permian . These are the teams that set up the coin toss as such.4 ) Boobie comes back on the team as a reserve to Chris Comer and after not getting any playing time in the Midland Lee game , he quits the team completely at half time and never stands on the sideline or goes to any games again . 5 ) Brian Chavez was a Tight End and Defensive End who wore # 85 not a Tight End and Strong Safety . In addition , Boobie wore # 35 and Ivory Christian wore # 62 . 6 ) The coaches end up liking Chris Comer as a player more than Boobie because he has a better lifting ethic and runs more straight up plays the way the staff prefers him too , this is in part why Boobie quits the team . 7 ) Dallas Carter is played in Austin at Darrell K. Royal Memorial stadium where UT plays in the state semi - finals not the state finals . Carter wins the state title but is forced to forfeit due to an ineligible player . The acting is done pretty well but if you read the book , you will see these flaws are pretty true . I am also tired of hearing all the PC hypocrites out there complain about the depiction of Dallas Carter 's football team . The team according to the book is as large , monstrous , talented , and black as the movie shows . People say it is a racist depiction but reading the book , you see a true depiction of the team . The story is very altered giving this movie a score of 3.5/10 . sub_rate: 0.002127659574468085; NE_rate: 0.0

Violent sequel to RoboCop was directed by Irvin Kershner (Never Say Never Again, The Empire Strikes Back) will never be as good as the original, because it is almost humorless, and it is extremely mean, and should have been rated NC-17, because of scenes with infants being involved in gunfights, people threatening to brutally murder very young infants with REAL automatic weapons, and even scenes with a 12 year old using lots of explicit profanity, giving drugs to lots of random people, shooting and graphically shooting up and killing policemen and SWAT officers, opening fire on police officers when lots of small and young children are present, and a whole group of children using strong profanity and beating up the store owner (who is a very old man) of an electronics store and stealing and destroying lots of items there. This film gives new meaning to the term "appallingly mean", but the effects and action sequences are exceptionally incredible. Overall, an OK movie. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0

What can I tell ... not much to this unity at totally . somewhat ho and uninteresting . The actors performances exist exactly fine . The only one that shines in any way is Simmons , but he solely has , maybe 3 scenes . I understand that by keeping his silver prison to a minimum he retains the deep psychical glory he has , but I ca n't serve but feel his gift was wasted . No unity else rose above mediocre . The history itself seems like it may be intriguing at the beginning , but then just does n't kick anywhere . There was n't a individual view in the movie that impressed me or made me feel like I had just seen something exceptional . The cinematography was reasonably flat ...

Truthfully , it was funnier than expected .

I watched this movie for the first time the other day and was bored to tears. I guess I just was looking for some flashback to the wonderful series that I remembered. I watched The Mod Squad television show religiously back in the day and it was fantastic. It was action packed and the relationship the 3 had with Greer was endearing. There wasn't any of that here. When Greer was murdered you get the idea that these 3 could have cared less. The actor who portrayed Pete is a really good actor but they wrote his part like he was mentally challenged. Pete in the television series was quiet and serious but had a funny side also. They had this guy acting like he was either on drugs on the time, drunk or just plain ignorant. I wouldn't recommend this movie at all. Especially if you were a fan of the TV series. It will be a complete letdown. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
plainly , soul was looking at catching onto the " Blair Witch " wave . This movie was set up like all the " world " haunted shows that are popping up on TV lately ( and I must admit , I get a kick out of these ) , but this movie is MUCH cheesier ! Probably the first three - quarters of the movie is filled with the " participants " going through the house , WHINING . Give me a break ! Spending 10 minutes whining about going up into the attic is not my idea of a good time . Any paranormal happenings are vociferous setups . No strings , but too perfectly caught on camera to be real . The " participants " were not very likeable either . Two goofy guys who do n't take it seriously , one girl who scares at the drop of a hat , and the quintessential over - played " paranormal " someone . Is this becoming the clichéd-"formula " for a ghost movie?I have to admit , the last 15 minutes or so were pure tension . They took every ounce of tension in the movie and stuck it in those 15 minutes . I include , I spent that time pacing in the kitchen . I truly would n't recommend this movie to younger viewers , even if it is India you 're looking for some entertainment , if you do n't take it seriously , you will get a thrill out of this picture .

manage n't find this unity . * * * * mollycoddler alert * * * * * The game of this aggravatingly tough motion is 7 friends exist talked into taking the bird from the airport by a really zealous number . On the bird with them is a quite milquetoast looking concern case . briefly into their trip the number of the bird takes an off - Allium and some lunatic device tries to die them off the road . The goal event is they have a monotonous tire . The number gets one of the masses on the bird to serve deepen the tire and the David slips and the guys fingers exist crushed between the tire and the bird . It 's at this level that the number reveals himself to be a abductor and he has taken all the masses hostage . directly the picture gets exceedingly ho and ho , as the characters do 7 crippled affair after another . 7 of the humans is killed trying to fly -- yet that lacks any suspense . eventually it is revealed that the Milquetoast concern guy is in cahoots with the number when Milquetoast Guy kills the former manful friend by slitting his throat . There exist a pair of attempts to get by the women . Atlantic is beaten over the mind with a tire iron -- yet he survives . The number is as beaten and somehow survived a principal on collision with a fence at high velocity while kneeling next to the steerage cycle . Somehow he did n't become through the window or still have gravely injured with a collision with windshield . so the womanhood driving the bird is knocked unconscious -- yet she had a steerage cycle to protect her and he had zip between him and the windshield . He is finally capable to keep the women and become them to an undercover garage that is a movement for human trafficking . 7 of the women is killed . The former 7 stabs the number in the stage with a honest sized part of broken mirror and shoots / grazes him in the mind , yet he is capable ( in what should be a hard weakened nation -- grievous stemma release , 7 mind injuries and a great ramification slash ) to sweep her out of the bird , drag her to a large crate , throw her in and get it locked , all the while with her fiercely fighting him . Now some people admire the message of the movie about human trafficking and how it is going on today . This is a serious problem .

A plot that is dumb beyond belief . However , that said , it must be admitted the lead actors go at their roles as though it were Shakespeare . And that is as it should be . It is n't their fault the writer seems to be in a coma . Hats off to what is really a very cunning performance by Joanna Kerns . She proves that just because it is n't on the page does n't mean a role ca n't be seized and dug into . And she does so with gusto . Good for her . Ditto to Christine Elise who is called upon to be little more than confused and weepy , but goes way beyond what is asked of her by the script . And to Grant Show as well . A graduate of daytime and prime time soaps ( Ryan 's Hope , Melrose Place ) . He is always versatile and underrated . His primary drawback seems to be his impossible - to - ignore good looks . He is a sturdy , well grounded actor capable of much more than he is generally given the opportunity to do . The rest of the cast is basically window dressing . The direction is adequate and the script , as I alluded to , is fairly preposterous . Watch this one to enjoy three good actors in the leads taking delight in performing some much needed scenery chewing . It 's fun . sub_rate: 0.00398406374501992; NE_rate: 0.0
First of all, I have to say that I am not generally a big fan of werewolf movies in general. It's not that I don't like them, just that I don't like them a lot. There are some that I have enjoyed...Werewolf of London (1935, Stuart Walker), An American Werewolf in London (1981, John Landis)...and some that I have thought were okay but nothing special...The Wolf Man (1941, George Waggner), The Howling (1981, Joe Dante), Dog Soldiers (2002, Neil Marshall) are some examples...but overall, the werewolf sub-genre is not my favorite. But I had this one on one of those 50 movie sets so I thought I'd give it a watch and see how it was.Spoilers follow...The Mad Monster is a werewolf tale, but the werewolf is primarily used as a vehicle for revenge by a mad scientist, Dr. Lorenzo Cameron (George Zucco). Dr. Cameron has discovered a way to transform human beings into beasts, specifically wolves, but was ridiculed and ostracized by the greater scientific community. Forced out of a prestigious position, he goes mad and plots revenge on those who mocked him in an old country mansion, where he lives with his daughter Lenora (the lovely Anne Nagel) and his assistant Petro (Glenn Strange) of limited mental abilities. Using his serum, Dr. Cameron transforms Petro into a werewolf and sends him off to kill his old rivals. Eventually, though, the werewolf Petro gets out of control and both the mad doctor and his creation are killed.The movie also plays out somewhat as a murder/crime drama, with Lenora's journalist suitor (Johnny Downs) investigating the doctor's strange behavior and the rash of murders. The story seems to borrow many elements from other big pictures that came before it. There are reminders of Frankenstein (1931, James Whale) in the creation of a monster which runs amok, and the creature killing an innocent child. Visions of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931, Rouben Mamoulian or the 1941, Victor Fleming version) and The Wolf Man (1941, George Waggner) also come to mind. And that is one of the problems with this movie in my view-it comes across as a mediocre melding of some great films. It doesn't add much to the genre.True, there are some redeeming qualities. George Zucco's performance was convincing, and the scene showing Dr. Lorenzo talking to his visions/hallucinations of his tormentors works well for me in showing his insanity. There is some reasonable character build up, at least in the case of his character. But Glenn Strange's character is not at all convincing, and seems to have this comedic quality-whether intentional or not, I'm not sure-that just doesn't fit into the movie as a whole.I seemed to like it more than most IMDb users based on my rating of 4/10, but it was still a below average film. Perhaps worth a view if you are a fan of early werewolf movies or a big fan of the 1930's and 1940's horror films, but unlikely to appeal to you if you are not. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
Because Disney more often than not , ignores the animation quality and a need for a good plot in their sequels , this was actually a nice surprise . I do n't know why Disney does not pay more attention to their sequels . The graphics quality is always inferior ; no backgrounds worthy of the name Disney , inane plots , and worse dialog , with little or no attention given to the actual story , and the caricature drawings are almost always worse than Saturday morning cartoons in detail and quality . The animation quality is still short when compared to Disney originals , and the dialog is quite old , the story line and overall execution was really quite enjoyable . While it is not equally captivating , it does not completely fail to capture the charm and/or mystery from the first . There is some hint of it , tucked away here and there . The children will like it , at any rate . It rates a 4.5/10 from ... the Fiend : . sub_rate: 0.01675977653631285; NE_rate: 0.0

I ' m very disappointed . First of all , the German synchronization tough bad . Maybe in the original version ( with subtitles ) it would have been better , but the whole movie looks like if the director saw Luna Papa and Black Cat White Cat and tried to produce something in this style , too . But failed in every aspect . It 's an incongruent mixture of a incredible unbelievable story and very childish gags . No atmosphere , no life . Extremely sexuality sex - humor . I voted 2 , because 1 is the worst , and the other point for ' Sybilla ' , she 's precious cute .

Ok , where to start . I ca n't believe how many good reviews I read on here . I watched this ( year 2004 ) and I had to fight to not push the stop button , I decided to continue just because of all the good reviews I read . After watching it I felt it was my duty to let the world know about this . First of all the movie seems like it is never going to begin , the plotline does n't actually occur until about 30 minutes before the movie ends , leaving the viewer wondering , ` when is this going to start ' So do n't ever call this a ` revenge movie ' because the revenge does n't even start until over half the movie is already gone by . Furthermore , the movie tries to make you believe this is a post - apocalyptic Australia . I am sorry if showing dusty rural roads half the movie and a crooked letter on a sign did n't quite convince me of that , even for 1979 this was not science fiction . thus anyways , add this on top of randomly placed homoerotic subtext and you have got yourself 7 stinky movie ( I have nothing against gays , there was just no need for it ) . The only good part was the first chase scene , good directing considering it was 1979 , and another good part is how he kills the last guy . So basically I recommend you watch the first 10 minutes and last 5 minutes and you will enjoy yourself much more than if you sat through all that stuff in the middle , which may lead you to gouge your own eyes out .

Have you ever wondered why these guys -- Seagal, Stallone, Willis, et al -- manage to survive all those gunfights in which they're outnumbered? I think I've got it figured out. The enemies always miss, and the hero doesn't.Here, Seagal has a pistol and outshoots a half dozen heavies firing at him from a few feet away. One of the heavies has a shotgun. Or maybe two of them have. It doesn't really matter. There could be a thousand shotguns blasting away at him and Seagal would still emerge with his ponytail intact.And when it comes to mano a mano combat -- forget it. The evildoers may or may not be armed with swords or knives or blunt object but Seagal, with his skill in aikido or tempura or sushido or play-do or whatever it is, brushes them aside with a few dismissive blows. Not only is he a master of these outré skills but his physical strength is Herculean. More than once he snaps somebody's long bones as easily as we would break a toothpick. One he breaks a guy's SPINE over his knee.I'll tell you something. (I'm getting into the spirit of the film here because Seagal uses that line, "I'll tell you something," several times, along with, "What's that supposed to mean?") These guys are fully deserving of extinction in any good Xenophobe's handbook. They are all black, speak with unintelligible Jah-MAY-can accents, wear dreadlocks that look in dire need of a shampoo, they torture and murder with aplomb, and -- here's the worst part. They're unchristian. That's right. They practice voodoo.Actually the voodoo element comes close to being the most interesting element of the film. They got the constituents of the ritual pretty well -- cigar smoke, rum spitting, the sacrificial chicken. They only left out the possession dance in which the spirit rides the dancer. They should have read Metraux on voodoo.Otherwise the plot adheres to the usual conventions. What was done to Jaqueline Bissett by the voodoo-practitioners in "The Deep" is done here to a friend of Seagal's. What was done to John Wayne when he was stuck between trucks in "McQ" is done here to Seagal himself. At the movie's very opening, when Seagal makes a brief speech about having seen too much pointless violence in his DEA career so he's now happily retired, and when we are introduced to his friends and family, I tried to keep track of his affiliates to see if I could pick out which ones would be horribly murdered or maimed to generate his quest for revenge.The acting doesn't really require much comment. But Charles, the Jamaican cop, played by Tom Wright, is really pretty good. Wright has considerable range. Here, he's an associate of dubious allegiance, rather sinister. But in "The Pentagon Wars" he has a comic part that he underplays perfectly.The Jamaicans never flew as movie villains. I don't know why exactly. It's a small movie market. And if you go to Jamaica stick to Montego Bay. However, if you want to see Jamaican voodoo drug dealers as heavies, and if you're in the mood for another typical-standard action flick, this should be a satisfying view. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
Acolytes presents an interesting intermixture of original concepts in " screaming teen " cliché revulsion with a more thriller - comparable pacing . In some ways Australian is really successful , but in many former ways the picture fails miserably . Ford Ford avoided the distinctive archetypes of the naiveness and whiteness of juvenility of interminable revulsion films in the like of David David , India chainsaw massacre , and unnumerable former films where unsuspicious and comparatively uninitiate and unacquainted teenagers , possess sexuality , pass around screaming and 7 - by - unity exist plucked off by some form of monstrosity . rather this whiteness is replaced with pride , revenge , and arrogance . The characters had respective opportunities to economize themselves from subjective expiry and desperation , but failed to perform thusly due to their own personal demons . In the terminal you were left with the tone that there were no ( and possibly exist no ) unacquainted victims . As the figure implies , the motion as touches greatly on following a drawing or confidence . This was used in a unmediated sentience of if the independent quality would turn like the successive Orcinus and was as used less now throughout the motion . Following a primal shape is a reoccurring report throughout the motion . Through all this , the motion makers likewise incorporated a fortune of cliché , which I suspect was intentional and gave the motion a singular variety of profundity equally comfortably as shallowness which I found intriguing . This , possibly unknowingly , plays easily with the characters who exist , at 5th appearance really shallow but as the history unfolds it becomes obvious that they exist , at least the 7 primary manful characters , rather complex . Technically the motion has a fortune of problems still . The motion , which is typically regarded extremely , I find kind sophomoric and all - stylized , utilizing formulaic 7 approaches far also rigidly . Many transitions I felt were likewise all - stylized . The enjoyment of symbolisation was not entirely faint , but likewise greatly all used . The game was badly planned and relied only on misinformation in society to reach a quite bathetic device end , which was badly resolved and leaves viewers confused . Methods used to conclude the culmination exist tatty and poorly - prepared , motivations are routinely unclear , and major plot points remain untied in the end . Overall , the film 's relative originality , themes and thesis are lost in a maze of poor technical execution , over - stylized imagery , unclear motives , obtuse and unnecessary symbolism and cheap twists maintained only by a lack of or entirely incorrect information . If the film were better executed , it would have been excellent . However , Acolytes receives only two stars in my opinion . sub_rate: 0.24795081967213115; NE_rate: 0.04132231404958678
While the prominent and over use of the play - like format is in total performance throughout the film , it is not however this that lets this depiction down . Rather it is the unlikely female performances and rather ho book that the film so obviously relied on a little too much . With an idea that had potential , the simple plot is diminished still by Graham 's failure to truly express the devastation her character so adamantly claims to experience . The use of improvised scenes by all the actors would not be such a bad idea if only the two leading ladies could take advantage of this privilege . As Downey Jr proves as usual what a gifted actor he is , he shadows the two actresses in their scenes together which is constantly noticeable . The superfluous yet intense sex scene seems merely to exist in order to prevent the film from being too verbally expressive giving the actors a very deserved break from talking . With an unsatisfying conclusion , Two Girls and a Guy has very little to recommend it other than Downey Jr 's formidable if not out of place performance . sub_rate: 0.035; NE_rate: 0.0

Travolta and Thurman deserved a better movie. This one is very secondary in all aspects, not a single fresh idea. But the biggest problem is this film's ridiculous philosophy. A gang of black rappers after all their criminal activities and even killing people are becoming almost positive Mickey Mouse-like heroes performing on stage and giving away awards at the ceremony. Perhaps this matches the real life. But showing it as a quite normal "happy-ending" is beyond my imagination.. "What's wrong with shooting a couple of bad Ukrainians if they are not politically correct?" - the show must go on!

I was n't expecting much from this film , but was eager to try something which I initially thought would primarily be an early 80s teen horror . Although three teens are somewhat critical plot , it is by no means a teen horror film . ' The Power ' is about a little Aztec idol that exchanges many hands as its possessor ( who must be adult and thus , ' corrupted ' ) becomes the vessel for unleashing all of the idol 's evil , and often with deadly implications for not only the victims of the possessor , but of the possessor himself . After making several exchanges in vying over control of this thing , three teenagers wind up finding it and ca n't figure out what it is , except that since they found it , strange and dangerous things are afoot . They offer to explain the situation to a news reporter who does n't buy into the spiritual bologna . Although , it is her producer who wants to investigate further , especially if it means he can get control of the idol ( I presume the teens are even not yet corrupted enough to feel the dangerous desires encouraged by the idol ) . It is a story told a thousand times , particularly in 1950s and 60s horror and science fiction fare . This one was at least , for me , able to sustain some interest . Though low budget , it was not done so obviously cheaply or loaded with high acting as many of the low - budget , come - and - go horror fare of the earlier decades had ( nowadays , they have the same cheesy qualities , but bigger budgets ) . We are spare enough of it to at least allow ourselves an opportunity to become at least a little bit absorbed with the eerie atmosphere and so forth , despite a story of clichés . And , though not terribly gory , exceptional special effects were done nicely . Again , it is routine horror tale , especially with the ending ( which by modern standards has become a device that is annoyingly overused ) , but one that is not so embarrassingly bad . It might be worth checking out , even if just for laughs . sub_rate: 0.005063291139240506; NE_rate: 0.0
The fact that this film was distributed free with a certain national newspaper which I do not care for did , to a degree , put me off of watching it , but as I had come across a copy that a local charity shop was giving away for nothing I felt I could watch it with a clear conscience . The film does have its moments , the evocation of the Thameside location is nicely done , but it does suffer , I feel , from a few too many faults . Firstly , Vinnie Jones is simply not convincing as the journalist . Whilst Vinnie himself is an interesting character , the truth is that he simply does not have the range of acting ability to pull off a role like this . Secondly , who would carry around with them a lost manuscript that they have been informed is " priceless " ? It seemed that everywhere Mr Jones went this manuscript went with him ! Thirdly , the whole Dickens aspect of the story , whilst appearing to be important , gets in the way of what could have been an interesting film of corruption in high places . Maybe I ' m just moment bit thick , but I really could not see the point of the story - within - a - story Dickens style . This added nothing to the film , and only served to confuse matters when things started to become interesting within the modern day story line . The piece bit of praise I will give the film makers is that at least they did attempt something a little different . I am all for British Independent films that try to be ' out of left field ' , but this is not a ' Red Road ' or ' This is England ' . What it is is a bit of a plenty , and an over - long one at that . Yes , it entertains in part , but in the end it felt like two films merged together to make a whole , and failing both by doing so . ( Also , I can not help think that I have seen something similar done recently on TV by Ian Banks , set in Edinburgh with a story concerning Sir Arthur Conan Doyle , the creator of Sherlock Holmes ) . sub_rate: 0.007425742574257425; NE_rate: 0.0
An hulking alien beastie crash - lands on Earth and soon wrecks havoc upon the populace first using his laser ray gun to dissolve into dust almost every human he catches sight off ( that is when his aim is n't terribly off ) and later his bare claws with which he likes to rip out and eat human spleen ! All in all , it 's pretty silly stuff . I do have to give it some points for being somewhat fun at times . I really enjoyed the mindless ray gun battle at the beginning and some of the later over the top gore effects . However it does n't help when the monster provides the movie 's just truly entertaining moments and he is n't on screen for a large portion of the film 's running time . The acting throughout this is exactly apparently amazing and inexpert and our lead hero Sheriff Cinder is much too unattractive to be bagging the film 's hottest chick . I also have to take off points for blatantly copying THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD ( 1951 ) on several occasions . When the monster is n't on a rampage , NIGHTBEAST is far too dull and eventually his attacks become so repetitive and predictable even they become less fun . Watch this one back to back with the 1951 THING and see the difference characterization , attention to plot and detail and creating suspense makes to a monster on the easy movie . sub_rate: 0.027559055118110236; NE_rate: 0.0
Rozema 's 1999 adaptation of Mansfield Park is far superior to this ostensibly slightly more faithful film . The 1999 film is reviled by many Austen purists , but I admire the job Rozema did in making Mansfield Park her own . It may not be strictly Jane Austen 's Mansfield Park , but at least it was well - written , beautifully shot , and well - acted by a superior cast . I do n't see how Austen purists can be any happier with this 2007 version from ITV ( and rebroadcast on Masterpiece Theatre / PBS ) . The screenplay is shoddily pasted together and dumbed down to boot , the production values are lackluster , and the cast ( apart from Jemma Redgrave and Blake Ritson ) are largely guilty of bad acting . I ca n't believe of a worst miscast than Billie Piper as Fanny Price . Her look was all wrong ( bleached hair and dark brows ? ? ) and her talent just was n't suited to the material . Sir Thomas looked constipated the whole time . Michelle Ryan as Mariah was on autopilot , as were the actors who portrayed the Crawfords ( when I think how superior Alessandro Nivola and Embeth Davidtz were in the ' 99 version , I barely kind shake my head).I have n't seen the 1983 version , so I ca n't comment on it , but I 'd advise anyone who 's curious to give the ' 99 version a chance . Read the novel before or after and make up your own mind . sub_rate: 0.014760147601476014; NE_rate: 0.25
As I mentioned in former comments , I became a actual great fan of David David always since I saw him in " Casablanca Casablanca Casablanca " .

This could have been so much better than it turned out . Tom Pittman gives a good performance and some of the older actors do well with what they have to work with , but it just does n't work . First , the actors are much too old to play high school students , especially Howard Veit ( Vince ) . He looks about thirty . Second , it 's hard to sympathize with inadequate Marv , especially since Betty is not all that hot , to start with.*******Spoilers * * * * * * The ending is so strange . It looks like the director intended for Pittman 's character to get shot , but there are no gunshots ... he 's just knocked to the cement , where he lays there until the ambulance drivers pick him up and place him on a stretcher ( face down ! ) . What were his injuries ? A skinned knee ? Goofy ! Vince has just shot his girlfriend dead without any remorse whatsoever , yet he simply shoves Marv to the ground and rushes off , despite the fact that he makes no secret of the fact that he hates the kid . And to make matters even sillier , Marv begs the police to tell his father he 's sad . ( Duh ! Hey Marv . You just got knocked around . I think you will have plenty of opportunities to tell your father you 're sad ... in person ) . And this writer did n't get an Oscar nomination ?

Foolish hikers go camping in the Utah mountains only to run into a murderous , disfigured gypsy . The Prey is a pretty run of the mill slasher film , that mostly suffers from a lack of imagination . The victim characters are all - too - familiar idiot teens which means one does n't really care about them , we just wonder when they will die ! Not to mention it has one too many cheesy moments and is padded with endless , unneeded nature footage . However it does have a few moments of interest to slasher fans , the occasional touch of spooky atmosphere , and a decent music score by Don Peake . Still , it 's business as usual for dead - camper movies . There are much better films in this vein , but over all The Prey may be watchable enough for die - hard slasher fans . Although one might be more rewarded to watch Just Before Dawn ( 1981 ) , Wrong Turn ( 2003 ) , or even The Final Terror ( 1983 ) again . * 1/2 out of * * * * sub_rate: 0.005154639175257732; NE_rate: 0.0

OK , no one will confuse this with Citizen Kane but you 've got to love a movie where the women are always topless . There are a few catfights and some kinky sex as well . On the other hand I hope they did n't overpay the guy who wrote the dialogue . Here 's a prime example . After one of the captive girls dies : " This is tremendous . It reminds me of the day Zenobia died " " A relative ? " " No , my favorite cow . " I guess they saved some money on the script and blew it on great special effects like that plastic crocodile . I will say that it took me three sittings to make it through this fine work of art , never a good sign . I guess that 's what happens after a while when everything looks the same .

My blurred childhood memories have kept the echo of the cult serie of Belphégor in the French 60 's ... so I was eager to see the big screen adaptation . I should have kept my money and gone for a stroll in the Louvre . The idea of the scenario is still very apt and interesting ( the fantom of Le Louvre ) but the adaptation is farcical . The dialogues hesitate permanently between French irony and serious " American business " without achieving neither but not without sounding asinine . Acting leaves somehow to be desired and special effects are meager compared to what one could expect ( low budget ? ) .What is left of all that . Not much outside a few good shots of Paris ... which is seldom a disappointment . Belphégor was worth more than that . sub_rate: 0.006944444444444444; NE_rate: 0.0
I rented this film courtesy of Netflix , thinking I would receive the 1972 version . I sat clueless , watching this new version , thinking : Gee , the production values were spectacular ! I was convinced the soundtrack had a slightly 70s ' sound to it . I was even more convinced that this was a 70s film when it occurred to me ( almost every five seconds ) that the one thing that was missing between Gene and Finney was an vivid hug , a loaded stare , a passionate kiss . I ' m sorry , although John Knowles himself has indicated that this was not a homosexual relationship , it sorely painfully obvious that yes , that 's exactly what it was . When people ( usually adolescents ) of the same sex have " intense " friendships , it means that those longings for love , togetherness , the desire to express oneself sexually , are all spilling over . These boys needed to connect , but they were never allowed to . Also , despite a spirited performance by Toby Moore , I never felt any of the emotions were real . I never connected to either of the boys , for the very reason their relationship was not truly honest . People want to live in a fantasy and think that because this took place in the 1940s that these boys could n't have had these sexual feelings for each other . But I say they did -- at least in the book they did , and in this movie , Finney had them , almost painfully , for Gene . The " intensity " that John Knowles suggests existed between them was a closet homosexuality , a hero worship , an idolatry -- that would , under normal circumstances , be expressed in a sexual way . Even if these boys were repressing it , it should have been crystal clear , picture this movie does n't even really hint at it . Lastly , there is an incredibly bizarre moment when Finney , who has broken his leg , is playfully jumped on by all the other boys during a ball game . Unless they were just a bunch of nincompoops , they would know they could not possibly throw their bodies against him . Obviously this bone - shattering moment was lost on both the director and the producer . sub_rate: 0.009779951100244499; NE_rate: 0.0
I think it is saying something that the Bollywood " Bride and PRejudice " stayed more faithful to the source material than this 2005 Hollywood version did . I also laughed more at the India interpretation . ( Mr. Kholi ? Priceless ! ) If you have read the book or seen the 1995 BBC interpretation ( and liked them ) , you will be in for a nasty surprise going in to this film so . My friend however , who had seen neither , was mildly amused by the film . If you exist a JAne Austen purist though , or even a picture - goer who dislikes historical inaccuracies , it will be painful to ride through this . Ugh , the book . The book was the biggest job . I imagine the actors would n't have fared 7 thus seriously if they 'd had a nice book , perhaps penned by soul who really loved Austen 's work . What travesties were committed ? Well , you 'll be forced to endure such incredulous lines as " Do n't you dare judge me , Lizzy ! " and " Leave me alone for once in your lives ! " . Not only are such lines far from anything that could come from Jane Austen 's eloquent pen , but can anyone honestly believe words like that spilling from the mouth of a genteel young lady from the Regency era ? The usance of modern colloquialisms is one of the many irritating ways that the screenwriter butchers the record . The writer also decided to give characters lines that , in the book , were said by a completely different characters and all for no apparent use . Worse of all , when they do seek to stick a bit closer to the book 's writing , the film has a nasty and unnecessary habit of rearranging Austen 's phrases and substituting awkward synonyms for her already perfect words . It was as if the film sat down with the record in one hand and a thesaurus in the other when writing the book . hold to Austen 's words ; she did it better than you ! I assume all of this was done in a " revisionist " spirit and in an effort to distance this film from the iconic 1995 BBC version . However , for me , it also made a travesty of the true spirit of Austen 's most beloved work . The casting did have potential , though it was quickly dashed away once the script kicked in . But Keira , giggling excessively and baring your crooked teeth does not equal charm and vivacity ! And I think Mr. McFayden , though I find him tolerably handsome enough , misread his script and was under the impression he was playing Heathcliff and not the formidable Mr. Darcy . I really did enjoy Brenda Blethyn , Kelly Reilly and the actor who played Mr. Collins . Their interpretations were really rather refreshing . Oh , but Donald Sutherland ! Somebody described his performance as seeming like a hobo who had accidentally wandered onto the movie set and I must say it is an apt description . And can somebody tell me why they fashioned Wickham after Legolas ? Though he was in the movie for under two minutes , I daresay , and without his impressive archery skills to perk up the movie . On a wardrobe note , I would kill for Miss Bingley 's dresses because they were sumptuous and would fit in more with the modern century . ( A sleeveless Regency evening gown ? Please ! More Versace than Austen , that is sure ) And poor Keira , all of the budget went to her salary and not her wardrobe ! Oh , and I ' m sure they eventually caught the bastard who stole the one hairbrush from the movie set . Unfortunately , they did n't catch him soon enough to comb the actresses ' tresses before filming rolled . In short , with this new Hollywood version , bid adieu to Austen 's eloquence , subtlety and wit because you 'll be getting the complete opposite . sub_rate: 0.036414565826330535; NE_rate: 0.038461538461538464

* Criticism does mention spoilers*I rarely make user comments , but this is one movie I have no trouble slandering . This picture stinks , and its mediocre of rating of 6 and a half stars is probably too high for such pulp . The Bone Collector is not at all the same quality of film that Silence of the Lambs or Seven were , despite what its ad claims . This is a perfect example of how not to make a thriller . The pace of this picture was highly slow- I really left for about 10 hours half - way through and came back at the accurate scene with the accurate same case with perfectly no progress ( I refer to you the part where David David 's quality debates Denzel about cutting off a corpse ' hands ) . The movie is not at totally chilling , but tries to compensate this with a passion - subplot albeit sexy Angelina David 's quality and Denzel Washington 's . Of course , what you get is something comparable to that of the mentor - student relationship as seen in the brillian epic Silence of the Lambs with Hannibal Lecter and Starling , however , even this lacks all strength and I was personally routing for the villain to drink David off so as to keep hackneyed giggles between the two . With such a stinky movie , I was 7 - expecting a game - twist or some sort of spectacular situation to occur at the goal to fall the picture some credit- things that fair movies like Arlington Road and Scream pulled off . Anybody with a 4th score education can see the ending how will be resolved ( a situation which mimicks Alfred Hitchcock 's Rear Window ) . The bromide of having the killer explain his motives was uninventive enough , but the reason was then farcical and unintelligent it had me spewing latte over the screen . Esoterically speaking , I still think the murderer 's intention was completely lost as Denzel happily recovers from his loss over the proverbial ' chess plot ' and gets with his favourite project , David . If you are a fan of movies with original ideas and truly dynamic concepts ( like I exist ) , you will not appreciate this film . If you have not attended a single movie in your life and would like to catch - up on every single Hollywood cliche ever borne ( the late - night knock on the window from somebody else but the murderer , the ridiculous serial - killer to prime investigator relationship , the horrible ' woman trying to get by in an all - male dominated workforce aka SOTL ) , see this movie .... but even then its too slow - paced and you 'd be bored . sub_rate: 0.08884297520661157; NE_rate: 0.046511627906976744

" Escape from Hell " is not made with enough artistry to disguise what it is : crass exploitation . The direction and writing are both waterlogged : for example , the camera - work during the fight between Cintia Lodetti and Ajita Wilson is so tough that you can barely make out what 's happening ; also , if the alcoholic - but - kind - hearted doctor had n't killed the warden , the guards would never have followed him and the girls after their escape - the " fake plague " plan had worked fine until then but he just had to ruin it . I would have given this film a 4 out of 10 ( the sweaty lesbian scene is not bad and Christina Lai has an amazingly beautiful face and body ) , but a particularly skanky scene of abuse forced me to cut 2 more points .

" De Dominee " is based on the lifetime of a real dutch gangster , Klaas Bruinsma ! In the movie he is called Klaas Donkers ! I have my doubts that events presented in the movie have something to do with what really happened ! But that does n't really matter ! Because it failed to grab my attention ! This picture bored the dogshit out of me ! It lacks essence and style ! The substance part could have been forgiven if the acting was any good and if the director tried to do something original ! Without the substance you at least have to bring some style or nice action ! Do n't we need to be entertained ? It would have helped if the director had seen more gangster movies ! It is obvious that he did n't ! Otherwise he would n't have made this the way he did ! This movie got a fortune of publicity because of a little scandal surrounding Klaas Bruinsma and a member of the Dutch Royal family ! This scandal has zip to do with the movie what so ever !

This is a documentary about homeless women . It was interesting in the sense that this focused on women who are engaged socially - having jobs and lasting friendships - but are in situations where they can not afford housing . I found some of the women covered to be interesting , but there was little focus or progression in the story . The direction and editing failed to maintain my attention .

Pumpkinhead was in itself a decent 80s horror flick . No classic by any means , but an enjoyable piece of fluff . Why then , have we now been treated to a fourth film in this franchise is beyond me . As in previous sequels , there 's nothing here to really connect the films except for the monster , the witch and Ed Harley ( Lance Henriksen ) . This time out we follow the feud between the Hatfields and the McCoys . Part of the film is a Romeo And Juliet romance as a young McCoy boy and his Hatfield lover decide to run away to be together . Soon , however , they are torn apart and the boy 's sister is killed . The boy escapes to the woods and gets the witch to resurrect Pumpkinhead for some vengeance . The acting is passable at best , inexpert at the worst . The titular demon does n't even really show up for almost forty minutes and when it does its a pale comparison between it and the original design . Overall , Blood Feud fails to impress . It may be worth a watch once , but certainly not an addition to the collection . sub_rate: 0.004761904761904762; NE_rate: 0.0
The only time I seem to trawl through IMDb comments is when I ' ve seen a duff film . I guess I ' m looking to find reassurance that it 's not just me . For me , then , Lonesome Jim was a duff film packed with incredible incredible in unbelievable situations which limped on lamely and boringly towards a cop - out hackneyed conclusion . So I check out what other people have to say and feel a bit like Jim , out on a limb , alienated , as page after page of multiple star ratings and plaudits leave me doubting my critical faculties . Yet maybe I should check the settings for the comments presentation , since after a while the gushing dies down and I ' m relieved to see appreciations that mirror my own . I feel vindicated . It IS a rubbish film , it DOESN'T hang together and it DOES constitute a wasted evening sitting through it . Praise be to kindred spirits . sub_rate: 0.011764705882352941; NE_rate: 0.0

Lucille Ball 's version of " Mame " in my opinion is one of the worst performances ever saved to film . After seeing Lucy in her various sitcoms more than an astronomical number of times , I can tell you that I really love Lucy , however , this movie is a fiasco of unbelievably big casting , music and dancing . Robert Preston is the only saving grace with a part tiny enough to miss if you blink . I do n't know what she was thinking , and I ca n't imagine how she was advised by the studio or music , but I really cringed watching this unenviable performance . I could be actually brutal and suggest watching it for a laugh , but it 's too pitiful even to qualify for that . Do n't run your money or your time . sub_rate: 0.047619047619047616; NE_rate: 0.0
I saw this only because my 10-yr - honest was bored . He and his friend hated it but of course liked being at the movies . This is the first time I ' ve strongly disagreed with Ebert in many years . There is not a single thing to recommend this film . Willis is good , as always . But news story stinks , incredible unbelievable , there is no news story , no action , no interesting cinematic sequences , no surprises , and worst of all , the child star is A thoroughly type slug guaranteed to turn off any parent who does not have a dweeby fat slob for a kid .

I went to see " TKIA " with high expectations , which might have influence on my opinion on it . I have seen all of the Dogme films , and this TKIA , is by far the worst . The story intertwines with themes from Shakespeare 's play : King Lear , but never succeeds in capturing the audience and making them care . The directing of the actors is very easy , still for Dogme style movies , and results in inadequate undefinable acting . The history lacks any dynamics whatsoever , and I lost interest very shortly . There are some scenes in the film which are there to shock the viewer , but I do n't think they enhanced the story at all . Mifunes sidste sang and Festen are both Dogmefilms that proved to be well directed , and had good storylines , so I shall look forward to better Dogmefilms in the future . Perhaps Aake Sandgren 's " An Invisible Man - Dogme 6 " will prove to lift the quality again . For he is , like Vinterberg and S.K.

In 1976 a mother named Norma Lewis ( Cameron Diaz ) lives with her son Walter and her husband Arthur ( James Marsden ) . One night a box is placed on the doorstep of their home and the following morning they cut open the box to reveal a button device that must be opened with a key . By the late afternoon , a man with horrific scarring on his face comes to their door and presents Norma with an offer . This piece is Arlington Steward ( Frank Langella ) and he announces that if they push the button someone in the world that the family does not know will die and they will receive a million dollars in cash . If they do n't press it , nothing will happen and the offer will move on to someone else . Norma and Arthur are not allowed to tell anyone including their son about this deal . The incentive for the family to push the button is heightened by their financial difficulties . Arthur , who is currently working for NASA , fails to be accepted into a new job he applies for and Norma , who is a teacher , learns that her faculty funding is being cut . One 's enjoyment for this bizarre sci - fi thriller , based on the short story " Button Button " by Richard Matheson , will be determined by how far they are willing to hold this preposterous premise . The opening of the film is specially problematic in grounding itself in a sense of realism with the household . Richard Kelly 's previous film Donnie Darko cleverly used the condition of schizophrenia to justify its excursion into paranormal activity and parallel universes . Without the dream - like state of that far superior film , The Box and the very thought of a device that can kill anyone in the world , is altogether implausible . That Norma would also accept someone into her house that has almost the same scarring as Two - Face from The Dark Knight and believe this offer , seems evenly artificial . If this sounds unlikely so far , what follows is even more absurd , involving a conspiracy about someone who was struck by lightning , the possibility of alien life or some other Godly being influencing these situations . Scenes involving gateways opening up in public libraries , random nose bleeds and mindless drones stalking the Lewis family , become almost unintentionally comical in their absurdity . To a point , the film could be called intriguing purely to see where it is going . Kelly is occasionally clever in his ability to hold our attention through many of the films contrivances . In one scene Norma is teaching a class and then is asked by a strange boy about her foot . He taunts her about it as she is missing four of her toes . Later , at a rehearsal dinner for a wedding that Norma and Arthur are attending , this same student appears as a waiter and seems to be stalking them . Yet the eventual justification for these all of these oddities is wrapped up in a highly contrived sci - fi revelation that many will find implausible and difficult to swallow . What is most disappointing about the film is that once the button is pressed surprisingly early on , many of the moral implications that were initially promised are diminished for much of pictures duration . The ending , which wo n't be spoilt here , resurfaces these moral questions again in the hope of echoing that of a Greek tragedy . While the resemblances can be seen , by this point , given the unlikelihood of so much of the film and the uneven performances , there is little reason to care . Cameron Diaz 's Southern accent might be unnecessary but it is surprisingly Langella who is the most disappointing in the film , with a very unsubtly written role , as the mysterious scarred man , who seems to be hiding a military base that would make Dr. Evil proud . It really is just a shadow of his towering performance in Frost / Nixon . There is not a lot for many of the other actors in the film to do ; in particular both Norma and Arthur could not be regarded as characters but mouthpieces for Kelly 's pastiche of ideas . Underdeveloped and brief conversations , such as where Norma sympathises with Arlington over their deformities and also when Norma and Arthur question whether they really know each other in case the button kills either of them , highlights this . Since 2001 , Richard Kelly has failed to make a film that has lived up to the quality and the imagination of Donnie Darko . Though this film might be intriguing for a little while , it is too absurd and implausible to be fully enjoyed and it would certainly not warrant multiple viewings given the film 's rather illogical revelations . Science fiction fans might be able to appreciate it somewhat more and draw their own conclusions , but what Kelly is really trying to say beneath the surface remains cryptic . The Box is one film this year that should have been shelved . sub_rate: 0.008888888888888889; NE_rate: 0.0
Shopping , sunny skies , beaches , boarding school for rich teenagers and absolutely happy endings . Welcome to the life of Zoey Brooks and her friends . Zoey Brooks is portrayed by Jamie Lynn Spears , the self proclaimed actress who got her claim to fame by being the younger sister of the international pop star Britney Spears . With her lovely blond wig in the first season and an attempt at hiding her monotonous country accent , it 's confirmed that Nickelodeon has indeed gone to the dogs with nepotism . When Kristin Herrera , the actress who portrayed Dana Cruz in the first season , left the show , all hope vanquished as she was the only decent actress . The female casting is a perfect disgrace but the male casting has potential for a teenage media . If they continue to pursue Jamie Lynn Spears as the picture of perfection , very many people will have to lower their standards . With hope , they will soon find that you ca n't make a career out of nothing . Jamie Lynn Spears is useless for acting , singing and anything else she attempts for that downward spiral she calls a career . There is no wondering why she is a self - proclaimed actress . Critics would most definitely proclaim her as something other than that . sub_rate: 0.008658008658008658; NE_rate: 0.0
While studying the differences between religion and cult in college , Mindy ( Rachel Miner ) , who is the best student in the class , convinces her schoolmates Cassandra ( Taryn Manning ) , Bailey ( Glenn Dunk ) , Alex ( Joel Michaely ) and Morgan ( Victoria Venegas ) to research the massacre of worshipers of Kwan Yin by their leader Owen Quinlin ( Robert Berson ) twenty years ago in California . Quinlin had found an ancient amulet in Southern China that would give an enormous power to him after the sacrifice of human souls , but one woman resists and he is destroyed . However , after the death of Morgan , who apparently committed suicide , the students discover that Quinlin has returned and is chasing their souls with his amulet . The storyline of ' Cult " is not wholly tough . Unfortunately , the screenplay , the direction , the acting , the lines , the camera , the CGI and the edition exist tremendous .

This was so high I ca n't even review it . So I 'll jot some sentences about what I witnessed , and it 'll be up to you to decide . Captain Kirk , with toupee and tubby gut , is rock climbing Yosemete 's El Capitan . Spock meets him halfway riding on a floating skateboard - like hovercraft . Kirk falls . Spock flies down , catches him inches before Kirk hits the ground head- first . Later , that night , Spock , Kirk and McCoy are eating beans around a campfire . Spock likes the beans . Then , Kirk and McCoy sing " Row Row Row Your Boat " , and want Spock to join in on the three - way harmony . Spock does n't want to sing . And later that night , he disagrees . " But life is n't but a dream , Captain " . Should I go on ? Okay ... A renegade Vulcan , who happens to be Spock 's half brother , leads a revolt on a sandy planet - taking hostages . The crew of the enterprise land on the planet , and Uhura , pushing fifty - five and weighing two - hundred some - odd pounds , lures the natives with her bare legs . But they ca n't trick the brother , who claims he can find God . He kidnaps the crew and the Enterprise . They go to a planet where a big bearded apparition , claiming to be God , spits fire at Kirk , Spock , and McCoy . Spock 's sibling , realizing it is n't God - but is really a form of himself - or something - joins with the apparition in order to destroy it and ... sparks fly . Then , after stuff happens too complicated to explain involving Klingons who resemble Lorenzo Lamas ... The Three Amigos - Kirk , Spock and McCoy - return to Yosemite ( did I mention , Kirk was wearing a GO CLIMB A ROCK T - shirt ? ) . With Spock playing some kind of funky Vulcan guitar , they sing " Row Row Row Your Boat " , this time all three harmonizing as the credits roll . sub_rate: 0.0026041666666666665; NE_rate: 0.0
I watched this film with a sort of dangerous fascination , like a hedgehog trapped in the headlights . There is no doubt that ( even if you enjoyed it ) it 's a big movie , but the important question is why ? It has a good cast ; it 's lively ; it 's prepared to tackle sex head on , with some of the characters actually getting some of it here and there , which is unusual for a British comedy . It also has Johnny Vegas and Mackenzie Crook , Marmite performers agreed but they ' ve have had their moments in the past . What it 's principally lacking is charm . The exist are impossibly preposterous incredible unbelievable and alienating , so that instead of picture film of Men disadvantageously Badly the producers have made Game On . middling author writer wanting to make a film about intimate sexual attitudes of dozy , sexist British men would have got hold of a few copies of Loaded , Zoo or even Viz to read Sid the Sexist and the thing would have written itself . Instead , the distinctly clearly tried get make up some moronic unmanageable difficult to care about , characters . Character comedy - as opposed to slapstick etc just only works if the audience realize recognise some human truth to the situation . But watching this film is like being told an annoying joke that you know is not going to end up funny but you ca check stop it woefully Sadly , picture film likewise also poorly made . game plot structure faint weak , there 's quality character delineation or development , and many of the scenes are amusing funny prison Time prison time the crippled lame reggae chips in to divide scenes , pointlessly and gratingly . There 's fortune lot uncalled needless repetition - when you ' 7 gag one joke about parking sexuality a sex party you do n't need to do it again . One wonders what the UK Film Council saw in the script . This is a world hands most men are rakes , and most women are continually up for it . The Apartment and very satirised much the same world view , but the producers picture live film accept it without criticism . Thus they ' ve ended up with deficient kind of inferior update of Confessions of a Window Cleaner . Somebody British needs to have another go at this kind of thing , and do it properly  a good next project for Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright I think ... sub_rate: 0.07972665148063782; NE_rate: 0.02857142857142857
I would not be giving away too much of the film to tell you that there are many , many , many , MANY scenes of Lucas ( the young protagonist ) walking and looking at things ! Yep . And you 'll be happy to know that the first third of the movie is superfluous , nonmeaningful , and reasonably much ignored for the rest of the film!This movie is populated by ho people who do dull things , and the dullest person of them all is young Lucas , who is going blind and needs an performance . You see , he has delusions , tremendous delusions ! He thinks a killer is preying on blind women ! He walks around a luck and acts like an insufferable jerk!Patience does NOT pay off with this film . By the end , the plot and events are just as confusing and lethargic , and it is very strong to care one way or the other about what any of the nightmarish images meant . Nothing is made clear , the film moves at a snail 's pace , and it left me with the same effects of a hangover .

Movies like these do not need sequels . Part of the advantage of Don Bluth moving away from Disney is that he did n't need to suffer their endless tirade of straight - to - video , poorly animated cash - in sequels . But apparently it was someone 's brilliant idea to make a sequel to " All Dogs Go to Heaven , " so we get this . Charlie Sheen replaces Burt and he 's not really as good . Most of the film is only a short excuse for a sequel and it is n't nearly as dark , different or entertaining as the original . I feel good for future generations who are going to have to suffer endless sequels like this without ever knowing what it was like to have a time when Hollywood did n't totally rely on successful films as a crutch to release banal crap .

MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS For about the last four years I 've been a keen fan of Ali G. Sacha Baron Cohen is undoubtedly a very funny and intelligent guy and , in my view , his best creation is Borat who 's as funny as Hell and quite shameless in what he does and says to people . Anyway , to the movie . I did n't bother paying money to see this in the cinema ; I suppose because I did n't expect a lot but when I hired the DVD recently , I found the whole thing pretty sad . The best part of Ali 's taking the mickey out of others was largely missing and the script an plot was pretty damned amazing ; hooking all the car batteries together to blow a safe - REALLY ! ! ? ? This movie goes to show I think that some things can run for too long and definitely do n't translate to the big screen . The movie also had that syrupy sweet ending that I 've come to expect from British films . Where have all the good British movie making ideals gone to ? That said , there were the odd very funny moments such as the dog in Ali 's bed and Ali 's audience with HM the Q with the " Shaven haven - RESPECT " remark . So , in summary , I am an Ali G and Borat fan and I have enjoyed many of his interviews ( notably the one with Anita Roddick of the Body Shop ) but this movie fell really flat with me . If there 's to be another movie , I hope it 's a whole lot better than this lot of old tripe . Weasel100 Canberra , Australia sub_rate: 0.0033003300330033004; NE_rate: 0.0
First , I do n't see how the movie is on any " best " list or how it won any awards . Compared to La Pianiste , which is also on a " best " list , La Pianiste is gold . This movie lacked so many things , on so many different levels , but I ca n't quite explain why I disliked it so much . The lead actor was vexatious , I felt as though I never knew what was going on , and I was BORED ! ! Even though this was supposed to be some worthwhile life change that Pierre was starting , I wanted it to end .... as soon as possible . Why did it have to be his sister and cousin ? Ugh . And why did Thibault get mean ? He just bipolarly turned mean . And also , was it me or did I miss the whole purpose of what that guy in black was all about ? Who were all those people playing music in the big basement of the big warehouse ? Why did they have all that weird equipment and the guns and all those extra rooms for people to live in ?

7 of the worst movies ever made . Let 's start with the trivial : Joaquin Phoenix is , first of all , too rich to be a rookie fireman . The NYFD does not recruit Pillsbury dough boys . John Travolta has a bad dye job , and the strange gleam in his eye throughout the movie made me think that he was on some sort of extended Scientology bender . The game hits on all the tropes and clichés of what the average Joe believes lifetime as a firefighter is truly like : they all get drunk , get into fights , have a hard time expressing their emotions , their wives all stay at home crying , they all have father issues , everyone has a Boston emphasis , et cetera . An execrable piece of schwarmerei that plays on our lingering cultural hero worship of firefighters after 9 - 11 -- which was , by the way , valid cultural hero worship . This film regrettably presents no believable heroes to worship . sub_rate: 0.04519774011299435; NE_rate: 0.125
Everything this film tried to do is done better - and superbly in "Run Lola Run". The Red Haired Hip Cutie, the critical deadline(s), The Lover in jeopardy, and the "Crime Pays-Sometimes" message. BUT, unlike "Lola", it just isn't believable or well put together. It is a labored knock off that might have worked for me if I had seen it before "Lola" - but it pales in comparison. Yes! The Falling Beetle was nice! But that was about the only surprise in the film. Do yourself a favor and see the Real McCoy - (And the REAL hip Red Head!) - in Run Lola Run! sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
This show lasted for most of the 1980s , and had its moments , but plots were usually dishwater thin and often sorely unfunny . Terry Scott and June Whitfield were wasted in this sitcom , they both deserved better , but it does provide some fond memories and I have found myself smiling at some repeated scenes . June Whitfield 's talent for comedy is allowed to shine through on occasion ( when she is not being a foil to Terry ) and she really is clever . The 1980s is the last decade where you will find this kind of middle class , middle aged comedy , and many people remember it fondly , but I prefer to remember the decade for alternative comedy and the biting satire of Spitting Image . sub_rate: 0.007462686567164179; NE_rate: 0.0
Tim Taylor is an abusive acholoic drug addict . He 's a coward and a child and has absolutely no redeeming qualities as an actor or a person . The only film with him in it that is enjoyable is " Galaxy Quest " and that just because his character - a boozed out washed up actor from a former hit TV show - was so close to real life for him . The rest of the mold is evenly defective . I HATE the mother and the actress that played her Patricia Richardson , she sucks ! Ever cliché is there , the unintelligent woman who is fat and likes opera and only cares about her children , while in real life she 's proclaims family values and gets divorced after having twins .

While I was watching this movie I never thought I 'd be defending it . It 's honest enough from the begininning about not having much of a plot . There 's no real characters to latch onto except the killer . Some of the acting can be better , but most of it is capable . I know , a three out of ten is n't stellar , but there are reviews saying it was shot poorly and altogether useless , etc . I think it set out to do what it 's supposed to fairly well . The lighting is minimal at times , more natural than most audiences are used to , but it 's supposed top look like a camcorder snuff film . In fact , at times the quality is probably still too high to be true to that , but nobody would make it through tne minutes of camera work that 's truly that bad . It 's not particularly scary , but it is disturbing at times . There are one or two characters who do n't come across as believable at all and the soundtrack does get tiring at times , but overall it was put together cleaner than a lot of camcorder movies . sub_rate: 0.004694835680751174; NE_rate: 0.0

That this film has such a low IMDb rating is not surprising . In our post - Enron era , do we really need any more reminders of America 's obsession with the greed creed ? The topic has become so politically charged that a lot of viewers not only are not going to be entertained by movies of this sort , but will respond with barely concealed rage . It was all I could do to sit quietly through this cinematic memo of corporate corruption without extracting the DVD and smashing it into a thousand pieces . What 's really irksome with these kinds of films , including " Purpose " , is their pretense that behind the glitter , there 's some meaningful message that makes the film worthwhile . In " Purpose " , I found no such meaningful message . What I did find was a story that idolized the materialistic trappings of capitalistic power and wealth . The two main characters , nauseating in their glibness , do very little actual work . Instead , they party , they play golf , they strut their coolness , they sound " hip " with dialogue straight out of MTV - culture - speak : " rock my world " , and " Now get back to partying ; that 's an order " . John is smug , self - important , shallow , and smirks a lot . Robert , who wears funky little glasses , is even worse . The film includes two youthful garage geeks , who look and sound like they 're right out of the film " Antitrust " ( 2001 ) . Stereotypes are played for all they 're worth , and in this film also include chic - looking computer equipment , and Barbie doll chicks on hand for those occasions when our can - do future billionaires need some relaxation after all that heavy - duty partying . And with the time - bound images and dialogue that such a story necessitates , can you imagine how dated this film will be in fifteen years?About the best I can do for this dissipation of cinematic celluloid is to say that it does have some nice aerial views of San Francisco . The film would have been a lot more enjoyable , a lot more entertaining , if they had ditched those odious characters and that repulsive story , and simply flown us viewers around in that little plane for the film 's duration . sub_rate: 0.002347417840375587; NE_rate: 0.0
So , as far as I gather , this episode is trying to make a statement about how real - life villains are very big people , and this is just as chilling as the paranormal . The " paranormal " imagery associated with the villain , Donnie , is purely symbolic . He 's actually just a normal human being . The problem is that I just do n't buy it . Donnie is simply not scarier than the paranormal . He 's not even that scary at all . As a guy who seems confused and weird rather than malicious , likes dead girls and hair , and has only newly become a murderer , he 's significantly less disturbing than most well - known real - life serial killers ( eg : he 's like a VERY watered - down version of Ed Gein ) . Which is why Scully 's horror at seeing nothing but bodies with hair and nails cut off ( something not too different from a normal personal hygiene routine ) , before anybody has even been killed or hurt at all , is completely out of character . She sees things a hundred times worse in almost every other episode and hardly flinches . So , as Comic Book Guy says ... " worst episode EVER ! " sub_rate: 0.008849557522123894; NE_rate: 0.0
When The Spirits Within was released , all you heard from Final Fantasy fans was how awful the movie was because it did n't seem like Final Fantasy . This is a different story , for better or worse . The familiar settings , characters , music , story , and over the top action scenes should thrill fans of the original game . The problem is that it just is n't a good movie in its own right . The direction during the fight scenes is often waterlogged , switching camera angles ridiculously fast in an attempt to make the action seem more frenetic , but only serving to make the scenes look jumbled and confusing . The CG itself is exceptional , but I ca n't say it 's the best I 've ever seen since Spirits Within had much more detail on the characters , although I must admit that Advent Children 's characters moved much more naturally . The plot is virtually a black hole . It 's a giant deus ex machina designed solely to bring Sephiroth back for one last fight . Old characters reappear , but serve no real purpose other than to please fans . Character development is nonexistent and the film does nothing at all to resolve any of the plot threads left hanging after the game 's end . But it 's packed with neat - looking fight scenes with magic , summons , and limit breaks , which is probably what fans wanted anyway . In the end , Advent Children is a very flashy , but totally brainless action flick that serves more as a side story for Final Fantasy VII than a real sequel . By the way , do n't think you 're hurting my feelings by voting Not Useful . It just makes me feel superior knowing that fanboys / fangirls resent my objectivity so greatly . sub_rate: 0.003105590062111801; NE_rate: 0.0
This movie is a festal passion story disguised as a tale of graffiti and friendship . Not ONE review described this movie as a gay romance film , and that 's the weight of the plot . I do n't know if this was to trick people that would otherwise be uninterested to sit through it , expecting the film to be as it was marketed ... The film is out of touch with graffiti culture , abuses and defames graffiti culture , and the playacting is unfathomable . Oh yeah , the graffiti sucks too . This movie was a clever way to hide the agenda of portraying young boys getting gay . Just look at the rest of the movies the director 's been involved with , all contain the same subject matter . Boring as hell , not what I expected . sub_rate: 0.027586206896551724; NE_rate: 0.0
The only reason for me for watching this little known Irish film was the question could Mike Myers have played a normal , dramatic quality . Well , he could and his acting was pretty good but regrettably that was probably the only good thing that I can say about this film . In the beginning film follows lifetime of twelve years old orphan Mickey who lives with his brother and sister with their somewhat eccentric grandma . Despite some strong language it looks like a household film but after a while it becomes clearly that Pete 's Meteor is a hardly suitable for young audience drama . And the worst is that it is a drama with indeed much farcical and even altogether implausible game . One preposterous story phone turns into another and all the time there is no much sense in the events on screen . I suppose when a lifetime drama needs a meteor or what is more something that looks like even more farcical religious content that 's a actually big sign . The characters are not much better than a story . Despite all his troubles young Mickey by no means is not a likable character but it 's clearly was somehow we were supposed to care about him and still feel warm sympathy to him . It does n't work . The same thing with former characters . They exist mostly as farcical as the story itself with the title quality ( although he was n't the main character ) as the only brilliant spot . Towards the end of the movie I still had a warm hope that there is something behind of all that improbability and absurdity . Unfortunately even if the writer of the story had such intentions ( and I ' m sure he had ) in the film they are hidden and practically imperceptible under such a book script class Grade : 3 out of 10 . Those of you who are interested in seeing Mike Myers as a drama actor can watch Pete 's Meteor for that reason but the rest of viewers most likely will be bitterly disappointed . sub_rate: 0.06629834254143646; NE_rate: 0.0
The story is n't very warm . manage n't expect a " Bourne identity " kind of movie . It started of strong , Tara speaking Russian and it even sounded credible . ( Not that I ' m the Russian language expert . ) Moscow had that darkish depressing look what gave this movie potential , I still believed in it . To bad it only took about half an hour to see they really missed the spot with this one . Acting was short , maybe because the story itself was not warm strong . There is this part in the movie where Gordon Patrick ( Nick Moran ) is having a conversation on the phone with the C.I.A. , like you 're listening to a Chinese synchronizer . W.T.F ! ? Too bad , the writer did n't even take little effort to give the main characters depth . Also , bit of tatty cheap and easy ending . Plus point is almost every scene where Tara Reid is in . Not that she 's acting that well , in fact , she does n't . But she really looks great in this movie . Overall , it was moment bit of a disappointment .

This is probable one of the worst movies i have ever seen . The only reason i gave it 2 stars out of 10 is the appearance of the gorgeous Lydie Denier in some of the scenes . Despite her 42 years she is an amazing woman in every aspect , her nude scene in the bathroom with Armand Assante is as hot as hell . Anyway about the movie , well nothing really interesting to say , a Neonazi and a Turkish gang fight over Berlin in scenes that include people open firing on the street in daylight and inside a club where 30 - 40 people fire at each other with machine guns in a place no bigger than my house and amazingly after some hours of firing just three die and ten are injured LOL.While the gangs fight over Berlin terittories a serial killer is killing young children and then dumps them painted white on various places around town . Armand Assante appears as the Turkish detective who although now working for the police was an ex leader for the Turkish gang and now is up to solve the serial killer crimes . The movie is obviously a very tough rip off of the classic M movie . The killing of the children , the involvement of the underworld , the character of the serial killer and the ending scene with the " trial " of the serial killer are more than influenced from this classic movie . The acting is tremendous , the hand just unintelligent , the production of the lowest standards possible and in general this was a great dissipation of time and money . Do n't even bother renting this one . sub_rate: 0.017361111111111112; NE_rate: 0.0
It 's painfully clear that all effort in this film was directed toward cinematography and very little attention to everything else . Most obvious mistake is the miscast of the entire female cast . Many of them are very experienced and capable , but they all seemed out of place , and having an amateur director certainly did n't help . The story is a very common Geisha story , and characters behaved very inconsistently , thus making it extremely difficult for me to connect with the heroine . This movie 's theme is " modern prostitution " , but still , it was annoying how Tsuchiya Anna 's lead character kept talking like a female motorcycle gang member while everyone else spoke in old Japanese fitting for this setting . This movie has very beautiful vibrant colors , similar to Zhang Yimou 's " Hero " , but viewers can easily tell it 's filmed in a cheap , elaborate set . The two sequences with Shiina Ringo 's insert songs were really nice though , in mid - section of the movie . I actually really disliked her music before , but they fit perfectly in this movie . Although Ninagawa Mika is a complete bankruptcy as a film director , she has a major potential in PV ( music video ) production . I believe the story felt very plain because the director failed to focus on character development , and because Tsuchiya Anna 's unconvincing acting as an Oiran . Had this film been directed by a known Jidaigeki director with any other known actress in Japan , it would 've had the potential to become a masterpiece . sub_rate: 0.0035335689045936395; NE_rate: 0.0
If it is honest that the movie only cost 150 K to make , it explains a fortune . But , it does n't explain why it has no real game . Midway through the movie I honestly did n't care if they made it out or not . I just wanted to finish the movie and go to bed . The ending was actually dense and made me wish I would have just shut the movie off and gone to bed early . Pretty good acting considering there was n't much to go with . If you enjoy actually big movies with ugly lighting ( even for a cave)and tough camera work ( even for a cave ) ... then you 'll really like this movie . By the way , if the boy 's plane crashed in 1980 when he was about 10 years old or so , how could he have forgotten how to speak , and built up so much anger ? ? Would n't he have wanted to get help from the first people he had seen even if it was 14 years later ? sub_rate: 0.04736842105263158; NE_rate: 0.0
Yeah , what did I expect ? I thought this would be a film about young adults at their turning - point in life , something like " Sonnenallee " or " American Pie " , which I liked a lot . I wanted to see a funny film , perhaps with an ironic look on idyllic Wuerzburg . And what did I get?Attention , spoilers ahead!This film starts with a lengthy dialogue which gives you a good hint of what will inevitably follow : more lengthy dialogues . Sometimes I thought Moritz Bleibtreu might have forgotten his text and trying to hide that fact by improvising and just repeating what he was saying before . But as I think of Bleibtreu as one of the better german actors , I believe that this effect really was intended . I think the author wanted to show how irksome talking to close friends can be - especially when they are stoned . But really , I do n't need cinema to be bored by stoned friends ' talk . Boring dialogues make up most of this film . But okay , that 's one thing . I can manage with that , I have seen nice films with abominable dialogues , just think of David 's life 's work . But the next thing is that characters are tatty and flat and that the storyline is as foreseeable as anything . Just one example ( SPOILER ! ! ) : Why , do you think , does someone take a garden hose to his hemp - works deep in the forest ? To water them ? Of course not , usually you do n't find water - pipes deep in forests , do you ? The only reason this water - hose is there is that a hunter who happens to come by while the two protagonists are harvesting their dope can be drugged , maltreated and finally filled up with three bottles of India . I truly hated this scene , because it 's really violent . Usually , I do n't mind violence in films - slapstick - comedies are full of it . But in that sort of comedy there is a silent understanding between the film and you that people do n't get hurt if they fall on their faces or get beaten with chairs or things like that . But if that happens in a film which is otherwise realistic enough , slapstick - scenes also seem real . In this particular scene in " Lammbock " I really thought that this hunter must be badly injured , if not dead - the final scene really invoked in me the impression that he is left to die there , totally filled up with more booze anyone could handle . And the protagonists just walk away . It would have been otherwise if the author had consistently followed one style ; the scene could have been quite funny . Talking about being consistently - that 's what I missed most about this film . The whole film seems to be a listing of small episodes that came to the author 's mind . Things just happen without a apparent reason - yeah , I know , that 's life , but that 's not cinema , because cinema is meant to tell a story , not to show boring episodes without any significance . I found myself asking " Where 's the point ? " all the time . Characters besides the two main ones are not elaborated , you never get to know why the protagonist 's sister wants to sleep with his best friend Kai , in fact , she tells you but I could not buy it , not at all . I think she just was there to give Kai an opportunity to act this childish AIDS - test sketch , which you sure have seen a thousand times before , and mostly better . The protagonist 's girlfriend you meet once , then she leaves Germany ( what you do n't even see and the guy does n't seem to care ) and finally it is mentioned in one sentence that she has met someone else in America and splits up with the protagonist . It seemed to me that the author wanted to tie up a few loose ends . He actually did n't , you never really get to know what 's so bad about studying law , being daddy 's son ( daddy fixes everything in the end and serves coffee in the middle of the night , which to my mind made him one of the nicer characters in the whole film ) and living in beautiful Wuerzburg . Even the dinner with daddy 's layer - friend , which maybe was intended to show how horrible it is to have to live up to dad 's expectations , seemed flat , just another nice dinner with the family 's friends ( except for the trip the guy is on later , but I think showing that eating dope before you dine with parents is n't healthy was not the point of this scene , if there was any ) . I have experienced far worse dinners in my life than this one and still finished my exams . I could n't understand one single character in the whole film , they just seemed flat and implausible . All this made it a not - so - good film , but not one I would n't watch again on television . It really had a few good scenes ( most of them were not new , though , like the one with the nice and understanding policemen ) , some were really funny , some dialogues were nice and I like Bleibtreu 's play , although he repeated his well - known stereotypes again this time . Not good , not abominable , that 's what I thought after the film was half over . But then came this incest scene and this I really found repulsive . Incest simply is n't funny . I do n't even know if this was intended to be funny , some people in the audience laughed , so it could have been meant this way . This scene spoiled the whole film for me , I could n't feel sympathy for the protagonist any more - I ca n't feel sympathy for anyone who f * * * * a helpless person , to me , this is rape and rape is n't funny . So it might have been a hint of drama or so , but the incest is never again mentioned ( although we thought this could have been one reason for the protagonist to leave Germany in the end , but as it is never mentioned again , we do n't know . ) , it is even totally unnecessary . I almost expected the sister to become pregnant in the end , which would just have added the finishing touch to this tasteless story , but not even this final cliche is fulfilled , just as nothing is really solved or thought through to the end in this film . It is n't really funny , it is n't really a drama , it is n't at all a road movie a la Tarantino despite desperate tries on violence , it is definitely not enjoyable . Skip this film . Watch " Final Fantasy " , that 's also bad , but at least with beautiful pictures and not that tasteless . sub_rate: 0.005443234836702955; NE_rate: 0.0
This picture is tremendous , it was then unmanageable to believe that Katie became a heartfelt teenager with the power to save the pity Chinese people , the movie did n't show any convincing argument to prove that . And the rest of the game did n't make any movement to show us more than a tatty common sense ... The game is farcical and the only thing we can extract from it is that it demonstrate how arrogant a human can be . Katie must have inherited her arrogance from her mother , the most vexatious character I possess seen for a long time .

I am coming out fighting here because this film was so well shot and so well cast that I am twice as angry about its de - evolution than I would have been with a lesser work . Without revealing too much of the plot , I can only say that part one of my 2 VHS set was an unnerving , unfolding delight of bizarre but plausible plot developments . The lead character was suitably naif - like but also intelligent and very very open . The events that he is rapidly forced to come to terms with are the separation of his parents , the culture shock when his Pakistani roots collide with a complete breakdown of English straitlaced society in the sixties , his father 's dubious transformation into the revered Buddha of Suburbia , and the turning of his cousin into a feminist militant as his best friend suddenly becomes an icon of the burgeoning punk movement in the seventies . Among other things . What made me so angry was the amount of detailed work each actor put into creating and establishing their characters in the first part , only to have the whole thing devolve into very high porn episodes in the second part , far too many to justify plot development , and far too explicit to even seem erotic . My biggest pet peeve is when directors let their private fetishes interfere with the truth of their movie , and this to me was a supreme example . I felt a bit like I 'd been invited to a party of very clever , funny strangers , only to have the doors locked and the guests not allowed to interact , and all of us forced to watch bad seventies sexploitation films instead . What an insult to the hard work of these amazing actors ! Why not just make a cheeseball flick to begin with ? And why cast a great lead character who can actually act , and then cut away from him whenever he is building up to a great performance ? I almost felt as if he too was growing tired of the endless sex scenes where all he did was lie there pumping his pelvis for yet another breathy naked actress . Bottom line - Part One is minor genius , Part Two is second tier soap opera perversion . I know the book is quite explicit , but I felt that these fine actors were as exploited in real life as their characters were in the movie , and it made me quite angry and very uncomfortable . Only John Waters can pull off such a dubious degrading of actors and plot and have it seem artistic . My suggestion is to only watch the first part , toss the second in the proverbial rubbish heap , and you will love the Buddha forever . Score A+F=0 sub_rate: 0.002036659877800407; NE_rate: 0.0

Not the best of the Lone Star series , but it moves along promptly with good performances . Introduced as " Singin ' Sandy " in the main title , John Wayne as a ' singing cowboy ' is n't successful-- you never even see a front close - up of him while he 's ' singing . ' The actual singer is the director 's son , Bill Bradley , who warbles away sounding like many popular singers of the day such as Hutch or Joseph Wagstaff . The film features : Cecilia Parker ( also seen in " The Lost Jungle " serial , " Tombstone Canyon , " and as older sister Marian in the Andy Hardy movies ) doing her best Katherine Hepburn-- " Really they must n't ; really I ' m not " ; Al St. John , before he literally became " Fuzzy " filling all his available screen time with his characteristic business of hat flipping , head and chin scratching , grimacing , and gawky physical gestures and movements ; George ( pre - Gabby ) Hayes as a gentle pipe smoking father ; and Forrest Taylor , minor vet of 395 movies and TV shows , playing the oily villain with string bow tie and prop cigar . Fun or odd moments : Yakima Canutt 's great ' under the stagecoach ' trick ; the ' gay ' scene when Singin ' Sandy ties Bert and Elmer together face to face , drags them roped to his horse , and dumps them at Kincaid 's office , where Kincaid says , " You 're a fine pair of lovebirds ! " ; Denton 's rapturous comment after an unspeakable song and guitar playing performance by ' Sandy , ' -- " Ummm . I could listen to that all night ! " ; Kincaid 's reply , We wo n't go into that , " after being told by a rancher " You ' ve got the soul of a snake ! " ; and , of course , he utters the immortal , " I ' ve made Denton an offer he ca n't refuse . " The plot of the movie is saved by Sandy 's tricking Kincaid , and later saying the three magic words in many of these films : " I ' m from Washington . " FDR has saved us from the Depression ! ( Is that why the villains are always either bankers or in real estate ? ) The shootout sequence is taken from the earlier Bradbury film " Man from Hell 's Edges " ( 1932 ) . All of the Lone Star westerns are special because of their unique mixture of interesting characters , the troupe of actors and stunt people , and the spin on the clichés and repetitive back stories and situations . This one ranks a little low , marred by the inappropriate and mis - used " Singing Cowboy " gimmick . I 'll give it a 4 . sub_rate: 0.003929273084479371; NE_rate: 0.0

wretched picture . A double dissipation of time and nothing what I expected it to be . The packaging makes it seem as if it is of the Australian Proto genre ( it is n't ) . rather it is a farcical stringing together of coincidences that makes the movie seem more like a writing exercise ( let 's try to see how many mix ups we can write in to make what should have been a bad SNL skit into a full length feature presentation ) . What is remarkable is that the director 's ( based on their commentary on the DVD ) take themselves completely seriously . I have been a huge fan of the movies that National Lampoon lends its name to , up to and including Van Wilder . With this one , I feel altogether cheated . In fact , I FEEL DUPED . I was expecting a Van Wilder like farce to relive my college days but instead was served an hour and a half of garbage . What lead to my ultimately unmet expectations ? Well , for starters , the fact that the cast all appear naked ( with an tremendous sausage covering what must be covered ) on the COVER of the DVD . Add to that the imagery on the back of the case as well as the description and you mislead people into thinking this is a picture that it is not . To make matters worse , the movie starts off as one might expect it too with half - naked drunk college students feebly trying a photo stunt , but ultimately this has nothing whatsoever to do with the movie . In fact , I did n't even realize that the people in that opening sequence where supposed to be the characters in the movie until I was told so by the directors in the commentary . Do n't get me wrong , I love plot twists and being surprised by movies , but I hate the fact that this movie tries to pawn itself off as something it is not . Ultimately , it does itself a immense disservice ( artistically , though most likely not financially ) because it sets its hearing up for mix and disappointment simply because it neglects to deliver what it advertises . In short , do not rent this movie based on what you see on the case . It is not your usual National Lampoon movie . The only thing funny about it is the fact that many of the actors have appeared in other movies and TV shows that make their involvement here entertaining . sub_rate: 0.029017857142857144; NE_rate: 0.07692307692307693
First off i 'll give this movie a humble scoring 4 out of 10 ! It was nothing more than a wannabe film . I felt very let down watching this film . I was lead to people it would be more drama and more facts about the true story it 's based on . Instead i spent over an hour watching middle aged mean break the law and take drugs . It 's abit like football factory but with no real storyline and not a good ending . After watching the film i was left wondering " What was that film all about ? " If you like films with no real storyline and a lot of drug taking and swearing then this is the film for you . I'm a BIG fan of mob and gangster movies but this film did not live up to the hype . I can see where the writer was trying to go with the film but it never reached it 's destination . One of the worst British films that i have ever watched . If only the movie had more of a storyline this would have bad an excellent movie . sub_rate: 0.005; NE_rate: 0.0
We were excited to rent this one after reading a few reviews and seeing that it scored so highly here . Well , we got it home and could not believe what we saw . Its basically comes off as if its written by some hard up perverted old guy who could not help inserting his sexual frustrations and fantasies into an anime film that really lacks in plot and humor . The main character is all over the place ... one moment , he is like an immature little kid , the next moment he is mature and intelligent , then heroic , then a perverted stalker . The worst part is all of the out of place sexual content . I have no problem with sex and dig a movie that has some good sexual energy , but this is just presented in a way that is creepy . Nipple slips , close ups of a girls crotch ( many times ) in white panties , or a swimsuit . It was totally out of place and it seemed as if the person who wrote it was trying to live out some fantasies through his cartoon characters . We were expecting something of a mature nature , but we just kept looking at each other and asking what the heck the point of this was ... besides jiggling cartoon boobs and inadequate dialogue . If you want to see some cartoon characters cleavage and crotch 's ... this is for you . If you are looking for something beyond that , this picture was vacuous . The characters and negotiation were hardly apparently vexatious . sub_rate: 0.02527075812274368; NE_rate: 0.0
great disappointment . CLASH BY NIGHT is much to talky and stagy and the dialog does n't resonate as honest coming from these characters . This is melodrama at its peak . The acting is truly over the top and very unreal . solely MARILYN MONROE and KEITH ANDES as supporting players give this film any zip . Wish they had more to do .

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * SPOILER********************SPOILER * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * This movie stunk . Just let me say now that I totally agree with what carissaphillips had to say about this . What was Sam thinking ? She was with a guy who told her he loved her ( 3 times in total ) , was EXTREMELY HOT , and stuck with her though her trying times ( Josh Hartnett ) . But , she decided to break up with him , no , cheat on him with a snobby , wretched , spoiled , rich - brat jerk loser who never said he loved her in the entire movie(oh wait , he wrote it on the wall , does that count ? ) , and left her in her time of need because he was scared ( Chris LOSER Klein ) . Who would you want to be with ? The only reason I sat through the entire movie was because it had Josh Hartnett in it and hoping that maybe she would die at the end . I wanted Jasper to get another girlfriend who was actually worthy of him . The whole " your mom " thing was funny . I enjoyed it . I hate it when people around here say it but I think that Kelley deserved it . Jasper should have said it to Sam as well , she needed a good slap . How the romance started is a mystery to me . They never said anything to each other anyway so I do n't understand how they got together . " I was thinking about the cheese sandwich you gave me ... did it have mustard or mayonnaise or ..... " Oh what a come on . The supposedly romantic lines were then unintelligent . Plus he 's sosososososososo David ! I must admit , I did cry in this movie . For a long time , really hard . Not because she died , but because she broke Jasper 's heart . He cried in this movie so many times ... he tried to smile for her but he could n't stop the tears . He cried when 1 ) He told her he loved her 2 ) She got sick 3 ) Chris Klein came back and he saw how happy she was w/ him 4 ) she died . I cried when he cried because he loved her her entire life , and told her , and yet she was dumb enough to not care and love a guy who left her in her time of need , and who DID NOT CRY at the funeral . 1 1/2 stars only because I LOVE JOSH HARTNETT !

The first movie of this series was well written and original . This show drags on , poorly written gags , boring flashbacks , not the comedy that I expected . Even the young folks found it slow .

I will commend it in only one respect .. it was innovative . Innovative does n't mean it 's a good film , it means that it can give you an idea of what you can take and implement in your own films . The simple plot is .. well .. simple . I got to the point where I did n't care if they destroy the building or not . If I had to hear that girl 's annoying giggle one more time , I swear I would hurl the DVD out the window . And there 's also the protagonist . They try to make him lovable , but he 's a freakin pervert ! Sniffing the girls bra , sneaking peeks at her when she 's naked , putting her bra over his eyes when he sleeps , putting her bra on a blow up sex doll ( which she takes her panties off while he s asleep and slips them on his doll .. umm)What irritates me even moreso is that crappy tinting . In the photo gallery on the DVD , you can see what the film looked liek before they greyscaled it and put in a color tint ( digitally too ) .. The film looked a LOT better without the effect .. so they sacrificed it being a good film just to be artsy ... bah . I could understand using gimmicks like that if the film quality was crap .. I think most people who liked this film just liked it because the chick was naked for a good 5 - 10 minutes . This does n't compare to Delicatessen ( like so many are tryign to do ) . Delicatessen has characters you can get into and like .. these people here just grunt and giggle . Lastly , I would also liek to point out that this was also tryign to be like a German Impressionistic film liek the old silents . One of the problems with most foreign , especially artsy , films is that thety focus on making an artsy composition and forget about the ' space ' of the scene . It results in the audience not really understanding what;s going on because they do n't get a sense of the space of the surroundings . Anyway , it 's wish . The short film on the DVD , Surprise , was a heckuva lot better . sub_rate: 0.0024390243902439024; NE_rate: 0.0
I am being in no way facetious when I say that this picture was worse than any other movie ever made . Worse than " Batman & Robin " . Worse than " Manos , Hands of Fate " . Seriously , it 's that tough . When people tell me that a movie is tremendous I use the " Two Girls " scale to figure it out . If the movie is comparable to " Two Girls " then I wo n't watch it . If it 's doubly equally good , maybe I 'll watch it , but only to laugh at the retards who paid somebody to make it , because a movie doubly equally good as this one would still be a man of food . sub_rate: 0.06923076923076923; NE_rate: 0.0
I 'd deliver to agree with the previous reviewer : This film has awesome animation , but has problems throughout the rest of the movie . game holes exist immense , dialog barely explains the concepts of the plot -- the MAIN PLOT POINTS are n't even fully explained until the last five minutes of the film . The characters state the obvious , while failing to explain the more confusing points of the film . There are characters that pop up and have importance in the storyline that are never explained -- most of them have names that are only mentioned * once * , and it is exceedingly confusing to a witness . Do n't rot your time with this movie . Unless you are in it for a good laugh and silent DUMB it is . sub_rate: 0.050724637681159424; NE_rate: 0.0
When my 2001 2001 2001 2001 2001 fell deceased at the field during this picture , that was all the ratification I needed that this picture is a lowlife . It was boring . The chilling parts were boring . The bathetic parts were boring . still the odd parts -- with 7 modest exceptions -- were boring . And predictable . And did I bring predictable ? Examples : 7 ) The gruff but loving dad indulging his terror of a child . 7 ) The gruff but loving dad buying the farm ( while singing a call ? ! ) . 7 ) The terror of a child deciding to thin and play , but , thanks to his friends , sting things out because they want him . 7 ) The terror of a child winning against unbelievable odds . 7 ) And a Ford quality voiced by an Australian Australian Australian actress . Got ta credit these filmmakers for that moment of originality and for perpetuating that stereotype . I did note 7 suspicious bits . In both cases , contributed by modest characters . The computer bouncing on the farmer 's heart was curious . The farm detent falling dupe to his doggy weaknesses while vying for leadership was curious . But the balance ? unspeakable . soul tried to progress a Hipness - Thru - citizens picture and progress it still hipper by making it a information - animated picture , and this was the event . And why progress the coyotes batman - baddie dense by monologuing with their victims , sooner than scarcely eating them ? Oh yeah . No stemma needed in this picture for kids , already concentrating on mock alcohol expenditure , destructive conduct and soft humour . And the foggy affair - in - a - boxwood ? scarcely what incisively was it ? A porcupine ? David David ?

I will never grow backwards hours hours hours of lifetime this motion has stolen from me . The movie is fundamentally a psychedelic drug trip disguised as an crucial creative appendage . I 'd know to live what they were on when this picture was being made . Its as the most historically - inaccurate picture in world ; 2001 has come and gone without any of the events or predictions taking office . Characters exist unlikable , figure is simplistic and everything scarcely rambles on without any mother or system to it . And the termination is likely the worst of it : its supposed to be thought - provoking but the sole opinion that entered my brain is " What the F$*K is going on ? !

In spite of many positive reviews this is a very ho film with three essentially good actors improvising the most banal dialog you will ever hear . This is another road movie that really goes no where . The camera frequently goes out of focus and the constant panning in some of the over long scenes is vexatious . The three characters are attractive but note likable . The cast also sets what must be an intergalactic record for the use of the tired word " dude " . ( Even Howard Stern has abandoned this tired pesudo pronoun).The three primary actors and one supporting actor show great promise . They are clearly comfortable and bravely allow themselves to be depicted as shallow and even goofy . The character actors all seem as they are plucky amateurs who generously volunteered to speak a few lines .. Indeed they all physically fit their roles well . All in all hours hours 90 minutes that seems more like an timeless . This is among my ten worst films of all time . sub_rate: 0.027777777777777776; NE_rate: 0.0

Without dubiousness , one of the worst films always made . inert and without body , stress or news , the picture coasts on the slight assumption of " putting unitedly a display " . Conflicts exist resolved within hours hours hours hours of their origination and negotiation is random and sequent . Everything is put unitedly in a slapdash society and frequently " Casablanca Casablanca " feels more like a deleted scenes spool than an real picture . The motion seems to live just as a case for gaudy and wholly random David melodious numbers . David David can be seen in the far superior octo - epical " tentacle " , and the REAL Mugil can be found in the Ford tone of " Casablanca Casablanca Casablanca Casablanca Casablanca " . sub_rate: 0.3458646616541353; NE_rate: 0.06521739130434782
Talk about marketing. The poster/home video cover of 'The New Twenty' broadcasts a half-naked male in a "Wolfe Video." For those familiar with the gay-themed movies  this broadcasts a "must-see." (I loved reading one reviewer (from another site) stating they had been "tricked" into seeing a "Sodomite" movie. Are you serious? The tagline itself as the word "gay." The Lord gives you eyes, yet you cannot see) That being said, despite the number of gay characters, stereotyped, no less (see: the lonely gay, the AIDS victim gay and the closeted gay) it's more about long-term friendship and characters that grow apart. In fact, if anything, there's more (here's one for Christians to complain about) heterosexual couples having sex outside of, gasp!, marriage. Not to mention backstabbing, drinking to excess and drug usage. I see this more of a made for TV-Logo or Showtime movie than big screen effort. Sure, I loved the cinematography, some of the actors could act and I always love seeing a big-group-of-friends that actually act like they've known each other for a million years. But we've see this all before. Nothing really "new" here. Barely an original idea  hence bringing back the same 'ole "I have AIDS, let's deal with that" for a good portion of the movie and boy, our friend has a serious drug problem, but let's not deal with that until it's almost too late. That's so (US) 'Queer as Folk' and 'Broken Hearts Club,' respectfully. The film deals with a group of college buddies, now grown (in size not minds) who have to eventually grow up and each trying their best while failing. Strangely, as in most of these independent movies, the most interesting, to me at least, was the heavier-set one, Ben. He stole each scene, but, again, there wasn't much to take. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
I watched this fundamentally for the exclusive reason that it was supposed to have Third Reich references in it . It turned out a pretty brainless and predictable slasher film that appeared to be made to appeal to feminists or something . Let me tell you something , if you wait an full movie to see the attractive female lead 's breasts , the last thing you want is a " tastefully " done sex scene with vexatious camera angles that do n't show anything . Her busty friend did n't get hers out either , but we saw plenty of men 's butts and pubic hair and guys with their shirts off . And at the end you have our heroine magically dodging the scalpel thrusts and swings of the villain ( who turns out to be the hunk , funnily enough ) and she easily out fights him ( uh huh ) while her male love interest is tied down and waiting to be rescued . The funniest part was when she picks up a chair and " swings " it at the guy and it breaks over him . Now it 'd be about as much as she could manage to lift the chair let alone smash it against a person with decent violence to reveal it ! It looks farcical , she fundamentally brushes it against him and it falls apart . If you are going to get this sort of " use change " wish ( which has already been done to death ) then you have to at least make it semi plausible . There was one good bit though . The big guy did get the better of her slutty friend , teaching her a lesson for being such a tramp and sleeping around . That 's not exactly something feminists would like . somewhat unintelligent really . Not that American slasher flicks are generally very better , but you have to wonder why they bothered . It brought nothing new to the genre at all.5/10 sub_rate: 0.04956268221574344; NE_rate: 0.0
I recently had to watch this for a project in a Sociology class and thought it was absolutely the worst movie I have ever had to sit through . It was like bad a bad cinemax movie with all the " good bits " taken out . Bad acting , the fake documentary set up , nonsensical plot , and rudderless direction all combine to make a tremendous , tremendous film . The female characters are basically only there to be sex objects . Consider this exchange : " He 's hot . " " He has a girlfriend . " " Do you have a girlfriend ? " " No . " * girl takes boys hand and leads him behind some bushes . boy comes out and sits next to other boy , girl saunters off * " Did you hit that ? " " No , I did n't want to take my pants off . " " You 're stupid . " Another girl shows up when the boys are going to Beverly Hills , gets in the trunk with one of the boys , and when they get pulled over by a cop , you see the car bobbing up and down . A homosexual pervert , a trigger - happy Clint Eastwood look alike , and what seems to be a luchador mask all add to the inanity . One of the boys gets caught by a cop , no one cares . One of the boys gets shot , no one cares . Someone said the dialogue was mostly improvised , and it shows . Just tremendous . I would never recommend this film to anyone . sub_rate: 0.01056338028169014; NE_rate: 0.0
Alas , it seems that the golden times of stylish Italian cinema have sunk into oblivion . And the recent brainchild of celebrated filmmaker Lamberto Bava is yet another obvious proof to that assumption . I felt lucky to watch many films from this prolific manager ( like Body Puzzle , Delerium , Macabre and both Demons ) . Albeit not totally satisfying they have never been that slow . A suspicion that this new entry to my DVD collection was money thrown to the winds arose shortly in the aftermath of the car crash scene exhibiting an uneasy and unlikely position of the body under the flip - over car . And the sense of shallowness grew up in the course of the ponderously narrated chain of events that followed . silent dialogs , suspenseless book and a full dissipation of talents from the international form . The only quality that provided more or less fair performance was the mischievous Mark 's son juicing up the entire boredom . Unfortunately , Mario 's son job on all accounts could hardly be hailed .

I was expecting a lot from Mr . Amitabh Bachan 's role of SARKAR , but am disappointed . Being a Ram Gopal Verma 's direction i was not ready for this kind of a movie . Sarkar is supposed to be a warm character , but the movie shows that Amitabh is too dependent on others power rather than his . There is a movie in Tamil called Nayakan based on the theme of GOD FATHER and Kamala Hassan has played the lead . The movie is well directed and the power till the end remains in the hands of Kamala Hassan , not his son . Amitabh Bachan seems to be too helpless in the movie and he just accepts everything instead of changing things .

I was an extra on this film , in the part shot at the airport in the first 15 minutes or so ; I was one of the fleeing ( mostly Mexican ) Bangladeshi refugees running across the runways at Ryan Field in Tucson . At one point , standing around in our turbans as we waited for another shot , one of my fellow extras turned to me asked me what the move was going to be about . I told him it was going to be a remake of Lost Horizons , only as a musical . There was a long pause , then he replied : " Man , this movie is gon na give " . Pretty perceptive of him , I thought . I had a good time and made a bit of money , but even with some interesting personal memories attached to this movie I ca n't ride through the whole thing . If you ever saw the movie " The Swarm " , you can pretty much get the idea . You get to see a lot of famous and talented people wasted on an an idea that on the face of it is merely high .

You get a good portion of Steven Seagal environmental anxieties , and some breathless mountain views along with cow - boy scenes ( or alternatively use parts of any remains of the HORSE WHISPERER ) . You then add a large piece of OUTBREAK virus or similar ( attention it must be more lethal and at least Biohazard Level 4 ) wrapped around a fat Militia group leader . You add one teaspoon of martial arts , and a zip of explosions and gunfire for the taste . Add the classic red Indian herbs for the extra taste . Serve immediately .

The plot : Four people are caught in an elevator . One is a business man , the annoying kind who is aggressive and complains about everything and everyone and is a walking - talking sample of distilled stress and hostility . Then there 's his colleague , a woman who is much more pleasant in her character . A teenage rebel who just broke into a coke machine and by his mere presence drives the businessman mad , and an older guy who just stole 100,000DM make up the rest of the cast ... The movie is all about how they cope with their problem , as time goes on and on without any success in reaching the outside world , as the lights go out , and as the cables begin to snap one after the other .... And yet , it is n't too exciting . The characters are stereotypes . The report is unintelligent and unbelievable ( how could so many things go so wrong in just one elevator ? ) . You do n't like the characters very much , you just hate one of them . And all the twists and turns in the game are not contributing to the excitement , they are only unintelligent excuses for filling yet another few minutes with dialogue as the screenwriters keep running out of inspiration and ink on a full - length movie set in an elevator .

The premise is interesting , original , and has the makings of making a classic .

A Sci-Fi Network original. Not the best. Not far from being the worst. An electrician(Richard Grieco) stumbles onto a "key" that can open a gateway to a parallel Earth that has been taken over by mutant spiders. The mutations have been controlled by a super-sized alien Queen for the past thirty years. She has already eaten up the population of this parallel world that resembles Chicago minus inhabitants. Guess what? Now she must find another world to feed on. The electrician leads a four man team that reluctantly finds themselves with the task of saving the world. The finale confrontation is probably the best part of the whole movie. The cast also features: Richard Yearwood, Colin Fox, Kate Greenhouse, Jason Jones and David Newman. One would have thought that the Sci-Fi Network could have spent more money on special effects. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
The other day I showed my boyfriend a great movie , Stand By Me , a movie I have shown to many people and they absolutely adored it , but for some odd reason he did n't like it . He lends me a movie called Highly and he tells me that he 's shown it to many people and they loved it , instead I hated this movie . I do n't think I ' ve hated a movie so much in a while , how this movie has even a 6.6 rating is beyond me . I could n't keep up with the five million stories here : David Baldwin becoming a fire man , the random competition rivalry , the random love story(s ) , the who 's being an arson story , research investigator , the fire who has a personality of it 's own . I just have a problem that this movie ca maintain keep up with all these stories , they did n't balance out well enough make the film interesting . I would have just preferred if this movie was about being a firefighter or the investigator and how he came to be one or what it is exactly he does and why . The movie tells the story of a group of Chicago firefighters , two brothers . David " David David McCaffrey , the elder brother , is obsessed with the beating of the fires that he fights . Brian , the younger brother quit the fire fighting academy school several years before , then embarking on a number of other unsuccessful careers before returning to become a firefighter . He is looked down on by his elder brother who expects him to fail in his newly chosen career as blast fire fighter . David " Shadow " Rimgale is an arson investigator who is dedicated to his profession . He is called in because a number of fires that have occurred have somewhat similar connections . .Martin Swayzak is an alderman on the City Council . He has obvious hopes of being elected to mayor , but has had to make a number of budget cuts to the fire department . Many of the rank and file firemen believe that the cuts that he has made are endangering the lives of the firefighters . However , Swayzak is initially successful in portraying the fire department as bloated and ineffectual after firemen are repeatedly being killed in blazes . I just could n't get into this movie , I do n't know how anyone else could , it was incredibly unrealistic and portrayed firefighters all wrong . I loved how they had every action cliché in the book to match this action flick . I just felt also like there was great talent wasted on such mediocre roles , Donald Sutherland , great actor , but such a strange role that could have been taken by a lesser known man who had the upcoming talent at the time . I know Ron was going for great quality , but I think him casting such huge actors in small roles was a mistake for this film . I even had to joke my way through while watching this movie commenting how the doctor in the background was probably Kevin Spacey . The fire was so unrealistic and the movie was just so out there , I did n't enjoy it and honestly would n't recommend it to people , I 'll stick to the recommendations in my relationship from this point on.2/10 sub_rate: 0.016666666666666666; NE_rate: 0.1

Crystal should know the three golden rules of Hollywood: 1) never play opposite a kid 2) never play opposite an animal 3) never play opposite someone that is almost 3 feet taller than you, is as innocent as a kid and "acts" like an animal.What is this story? A comedy? I guess, but I didn't laugh, except at the scenes where Crystal is on his own and not burdened with his (what-is-her-role-in-this-movie) ex-wife or the afore-mentioned Giant. Did I mention there's also a kid in this film? Well, forget about him. The son is brought in to make us feel sorry for Crystal, and we do, but for the actor, not the character. Billy Crystal is a funny man. If you don't believe me, watch him in old episodes of "Soap" or "Saturday Night Live." Go rent "City Slicker" or "Running Scared" or "When Harry Met Sally.""Giant" is more ho-hum than fee-fi-fo-fum. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
The chess scenery really got me into watching the movie . However , not more than 5 minutes later , I was already gouging my eyes out . Not only could I not understand a word that was said , the acting could deliver been better by a group of mentally handicapped . The one highlight of this picture was that there was a punk white midget . However , I did n't quite get the connection on how a white midget was the child of two African Americans . But I guess anything is possible . Also , why the hell was Robin in the movie ? I ' m not sure that it added anything artistically . Overall , I would strongly recommend you jump off a cliff before you rent this picture . sub_rate: 0.037037037037037035; NE_rate: 0.0
Its a sin how these things are made, but then again we wouldn't get to see the best "Dummy scene" ever filmed. Ahhh the beauty of low budget Bigfoot flicks, you lean to see the beauty the more you watch them, thats if your brain doesn't melt first. As I said before, this has the best dummy scene ever! Words cant express it, you have to see it for yourself. Wonderful lines such as "Smells like decain flesh", "Thems human..."(You will know this one when you see it) The creature makes a Blah, Blah! sound and the scene where the baby gets shot will make you cry(with laughter) you will be rewinding it. Has a car chase, snowmobile chase, a Bigfoot folk song as well as a Disco song. It dosn't end there, while watching the credits a friend noticed "Wardrobe provided by K-Mart". You ask, how could you even get as far as the credits and then watch them? I could only explain this as a sort of shock to the brain, you are so mentally exhausted you cant move and also I guess you have to know who was behind the mess. All that being said, this is a must see especially if you want to punish yourself mentally. Its a keeper! sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0

MASTER PLAN : stimulate the winning team in a deadly tournament . One of several martial arts action pictures that attempted to capture the flavor of the famous " Enter the Dragon " from ' 73 , this one is an effort from South Africa . The villain 's stronghold is a bit different , appearing as a white castle - like fortress in the middle of the desert from a distance . The villain himself , a Baron or general , is a slightly more perverse version of the " Dr . No " or Han mold of master villainy , having strange flashbacks to the glory days of Nazi Germany . He does wear the full regalia Nazi uniform at some points . His main ambition in life is to hold an illegal martial arts competition / tournament against his Japanese rival , an extension of their complicity in the 2nd World War ( my army is better than your army ) . It sounds silly and it is , though the suggestion of madness and crazed machismo almost works . The central hero , Steve Chase ( Ryan ) , resembles a white ' Bruce Lee ' character , having a similarly lean , lithe physique , though obviously not on the same level of martial arts expertise . I thought he would be some secret government agent here but apparently not . He and his girlfriend have joined the Baron 's team of fighters , but decide to quit ( what did they think they were getting into ? ) . Of course , it 's not that easy . There 's an odd sequence of them escaping through the desert using a wrecked car with a rigged sail - those desert winds can do wonders for travel , it seems . The plot kind of meanders in the 2nd half , as the hero joins the team of the villain 's competitor and the girlfriend is held hostage by the villain in a cell , under threat of rape by the hero 's rival . The most interesting character turns out to be Chico , a dwarf who is the villain 's assistant ; he 's loyal to the Baron but is sympathetic to the plight of the hero . Much of the fighting utilizes the ballet - like capabilities of the hero , with a lot of leaping and slow motion . The sound FX are also amped up and exaggerated in an attempt to add more impact to the blows . There are a few good fights during the tournament towards the climax , but none really stand out . If one had to pick , I suppose the best involves the brutish muscle man - henchman of the Baron , introduced late in the story ( he lifts the back of a car at one point ) . You wonder how the hero will take him out at the end , since the brute seems to shrug off most of the punches . The acting is very mediocre , descending into camp as far as the girlfriend , who tends to laugh for no reason , as if she 's high on grass , though she is very cute . Some of the training scenes are also campy , especially all those guys running over or rolling down the desert sands . And , with such a title , there 's surprisingly few actual killings . Ryan , as Steve Chase , returned as a traditional agent in the sequel " Kill and Kill Again .

frightening . I hope I can save two hours of your life by warning you away from this . I just finished watching the film , BTW.I love good cross genre films . This is n't one of them . Show me a sci - fi musical , a dramatic farce , or a religious action flick , I 'll watch them all . But you can not just throw epigrammatic quips at a rambling , camp , schlock - horror fest and draw my applause . I love philosophical films . This is n't one of them . Anyone who is amazed at the depths of intellect plumbed in this film has n't read a good book lately . Or ever . The " thought - provoking " dialogue is trite , at best . Perhaps it lost something in the translation . I love a good horror - comedy . This is n't one of them . Laugh ! I thought I 'd never start ! Squirm ? Only when trying to think of a polite way to phrase my feedback of the film to the friend who recommended it . Rupert is incongruously good in the setting of this film , but even he can not resurrect it . I only wish he had shot the director instead if the zombies .

Evan Almighty continues the mainstream Bruce Almighty franchise , this time with newsman turned freshman Congressman from Buffalo , Evan Baxter ( Steve Carell ) , at it 's center . A wholly innocuous ( and not even really self - doubting ) man , God ( Morgan Freeman ) decides to enforce some sort of quest upon Baxter , in order to illustrate the importance of ... reciprocal kindness , so that Baxter can " change the world " ( aka , pay it forward).Think of Evan Almighty as a wholesome derivative of ' Distinguished Gentlemen . ' Baxter is not a con , but his colleague , Congressman Long ( John Goodman ) wants his unquestioned support on a bill that essentially , is harmful to the environment . And well - meaning Baxter , knowing the importance of networking and visibility , is willing to support him . In addition , with the new job comes more responsibility , and Baxter is in a sense , vilified , for not spending enough time with his family . So God , decides to give Evan Baxter some guidance by forcing him to become the modern day Noah . His orders : build an ark . Except , while it may be mildly humorous to see Baxter 's transformation to the " weirdo with a beard - o , " there does n't seem to be much point to this solid thing which becomes abundantly clearer when the climax of the film fizzles . ( SPOILERS : if none of the population is killed by the " flood " , then what was the point of summoning the animals ... or at least the ones that obviously were n't from suburban Virginia ? or , more importantly , if all Baxter had to realize was that Long 's projects faltered in their quality , then why did he have to build an ark?).So , although a comedy like this need n't be a hysterical laugh - riot , it was certainly one made far less enjoyable as it was crammed with far too many homilies ( and not all from Morgan Freeman ) and action that seemed intended for a film of more epic events . sub_rate: 0.002652519893899204; NE_rate: 0.0

There are plenty of reviews that describe this picture as the worst ever made . For sure there are plenty of mistakes : lackluster playacting , sooner ho and cliched and at times paradoxical book , and the stock group - movie sound and " exceptional " effects . As noted , there are plenty of glosses of plot , making _ Cave Dwellers _ a tissue of fantasy film , especially in comparison with the Lord of the Rings trilogy . However , this movie is not the worst movie ever . Most , if not all , ( including this review ) of these reviews are written by fans of MSTK3 . Therefore , many of these reviews are reasonably much summaries of the MSTK3 episode of _ Cave Dwellers_.In the episode , Joel , Tom Servo , and Crow remark to the Mad Scientists that this is the worst movie ever sent to them . Of course , loyal fans have taken this quote and ran with it . I possess found this movie endearing - not in a way that one finds _ Forrest Gump _ endearing - but in the movement put into this movie by some the form . Also , this movie is funny without its MSTK3 treatment . That is because _ Cave Dwellers _ does not take itself seriously , and it is not trying to import into its viewers some sort of righteous theme . For all of the monster puppets , medieval hang gliding , and continuity lapses - this picture does not advertise to be any more that what it is , a shallow depiction of a kind shallow genre . also , I ca n't bring myself to hate Miles O'Keeffe or Lisa Foster . Instead this hatred is for Coleman Francis , Tony Cardoza , Jennifer Lopez , Arch Hall , Jr. , and so on . sub_rate: 0.04672897196261682; NE_rate: 0.0
I rented a copy of this one from Netflix -- big misapprehension . The DVD version titled " The One - Armed Swordsmen " was produced by madmen who thought that the fighting sequences would be appreciated better pasted all together in one big chapter than as part of a consistent , sequential story . Some of the story was left in separate chapters , which you can select from the main menu , but the DVD is still a plenty . Do n't rent or buy it . Not that there was anything wonderful about the original story , an absurdly complicated piece of nonsense . Much as I liked seeing Wang Yu in his prime again after all these years , this one is an double dissipation of time . I ' ve had dish detergents that made a better film than this . What the chopped - up DVD version shows us is that no matter how silly a Chinese script may be , you have to see some sort of story to care about how the fighting sequences turn out . But " The One - Armed Swordsmen " does offer you do the chance to see both Wang and Shaw Brothers stalwart Lo Lieh beating up smirking pretty boy David Chiang -- it 's always a pleasure to see that happen . Lo plays a sort of second - string villain here , and serves as a prime example of why some people really need orthodontists . he film is also graced by the participation of Taiwanese actor Chang Yi as the magistrate . Another comment above mentions the obligatory fight - in - the - inn scene ( there are two , in fact ) where Wang and Chiang are attacked by a pack of comical barbarians using what look like cavemen weapons , making Bruce Lee noises while they fight . None of this makes any sense , but that 's okay if you 're not expecting any clarity or common sense . It was fun to watch anyway . Another peculiarity of this production is that there are no significant women characters . There are a couple of female roles , but they play no serious role in the action or the plot . If you can find a copy of the original Shaw Brothers One - Armed Swordsman movie , the one which explains why he has only the one arm and why he uses a broken sword , go for it . sub_rate: 0.009501187648456057; NE_rate: 0.0

The motion manages to coast equally far as it does on the force of Ford Ford game entirely ( all her plots possess a sure sum of constitutional involvement ) , but the way is dispiritedly monotonous .

This was one of the shows that I wanted to follow - up on . But , I 'd just could n't bring myself on devoting my time to this show . To have a show that centers on the topic of politics , you really need a strong plot with twists and turns to enhance the mood of the show , something like " The West Wing " or " Commander - in - Chief . " Rob Lowe was OK , but actors like Kyle Chandler just could n't act ( he was amazing in " Early Edition " ) . It was a pain to sit through this show . With its lack of suspense , urgency , and characters who can actually act , I just had to give up on this show and am glad it was canceled so I would have nothing more to miss .

I normally do n't try and second suppose a crime thriller , but David was hardly only likewise predictable . Samuel L. Jackson playing the quality Tom Cutler , along with his profession created an interesting twist in the beginning of the film , however , that was about it . Without even thinking I knew where the plot would be taken and within 30 minutes I had already figured out who the killer was . Rather then trusting myself and having seen several films that make a turnabout , I watched to its completion . What a disappointment , I was good from the beginning . The cast of characters was a honest , equally well as the acting from Jackson and Harris ... except for Eva Mendes . From the starting gate she did n't play a believable quality in correlation to the book and this ruined the intact game also soon . Maybe this was a directing mishap or just weakness in the history itself . Her role as Ann Norcut should deliver shown more emotion and distress for the situation that was building around her . This would ' ve made the build - up moment bit more compelling and the ending more dramatic . Nevertheless David Cleaner is watchable , not memorable .

Although this starts out promisingly , a woman in a car is weaving around dark roads in the middle of the night in the middle of the forest until she almost hits a man holding a lizard ! This gave me the impression that we were going to see something special , something almost David Lynchian ( if there is such a term ) , but unfortunately , the film starts to go everyplace , not having a core center , just sort of meandering story about a woman trying to solve a mystery of a small town . The character study goes all over the place , and I could n't really care for any of the characters it seems , especially when some of the story all of a sudden goes into flashback mode .

This is a passably superfluous remake . Starting with the opening deed shots of the pilot was a substantial misapprehension as it reminds the witness of what a expectant trivial menstruation composition hair that was . The unexampled variation that follows is an recitation in redundance . David David plays a ' city boy ' photographer who returns to a semi - abandoned desert township populated by a scatter of underdeveloped clichéd livestock characters : the popsicle sucking David David David David , the ' cantankerous honest coot prospector , the crippled veteran and his Australian wife , etc ... David 's quality witnesses the crashing of ' something ' into a hillside and concisely after unusual things start to occur as pieces of weird dismal tilt exist scattered roughly . The temperature starts to climb , all the body in the domain vanishes , masses start to play weirdly , things explode . David 's quality gets in and out of his elevator more frequently than is humanly potential in 7 motion . The movie develops no sentience of piazza , no quality ontogenesis , no witticism , no latent . Everything that made the David David David original a creepy trivial frigid - state paranoia classic has been abandoned . It scarcely runs through its minimum hoops and so scarcely ends . The especial effects exist n't really especial - the interior of the ship looks like bits of cling picture wrapped round some ropes which were so dangled in movement of the television to put some of the most uninventive and incompetent wire - employment always lay onto the concealment . The hand is insistent - everyone says everything at least doubly , David gets to sound " get 's pose out of here " 7 7 7 times during the picture , doubly in 7 conniption . scads of things exist left unexplained at the terminal - why do the aliens require all the heating and body for deterrent ? - not that anyone watching would manage ; if the picture makers did n't manage why should we?The playacting is tolerable - better than the book , which at times , has an under - rehearsed improvisational timber , deserves . Though frequently the actors attend like they scarcely want to pose the affair over with equally promptly as potential - a renowned deterrent of this is when Elizabeth Peña registers the briefest , token moment of " frustrated despair hands to face gesture " before following sulking son Stevie outside to watch him do " angry sulky teenager smashing something off a table " gesture . Continuity errors include the ( GB ) sticker on the back of Kerwin 's jeep appearing and disappearing , a double action of the gas in the exploding car , a towns - person being in two places simultaneously - once in the Alien Stevie 's POV shot then immediately afterwards in a reaction shot , Elizabeth Peña appearing to shut a car door twice ... you can tell I was gripped ca n't you ?

An excellent cast who do their best with an amazing hand , inept direction , and some of the worst score that I have ever heard . More TV movie of the week than serious drama . Which is sad when one considers that the source material is very serious and very real . The film makers decided that instead of building drama and character , it was better to just show the most graphic and violent bits and hope that the audience would be shocked into sympathy and caring .

This episode has just aired in the UK.What a disappointment . The heavy - handed touches of humour were ill - judged , childish and detracted from what could have been a pretty good storyline . I can not believe that Jerry Bruckheimer allowed this episode to take place . I have seen every previous episode of this show , and even the episode where Jack played his own older self was way ahead of this episode . The lesbian kiss was wretched sensationalism . There was also no continuity from the previous episode . There was nothing in the storyline investigating Martin 's dangerous behaviour or possible drug addiction . There was similarly nothing explicitly written about Jack 's burgeoning relationship with Ann . Usually Without A Trace is pretty good at this sort of continuity .

This movie is so high it 's worth seeing . This movie will have viewers lapsing in and out of a coma within the first 10 minutes . It all started when a bunch of writers came up with the idea of a jetliner being hijacked and a passenger who can fly a small plane has to land the beast . However , they know it 's been done before many times so to make it different , let 's do it very disadvantageously ! Major Masters has his name pirated from 80 's movie " To Live and Die in L.A. " from character played by Willem Dafoe . That saved 10 minutes in writing and production time . The plane is supposed to be a Boieng 747 . That plane has a unique silhouette , even in the dark with its characteristic forward hump on the top . Just ask the late Ronald Reagan who lamented this point when them Ruskies shot down KAL 007 in the eighties . Yet when the plane takes off it 's clearly not a 747 looks more like a 767 . This well researched film also forgets to include the engineer 's seat in the cockpit and replaces it with two comfy rumble seats . No need for a flight engineer on this complex plane ! Heroine is played by perpetually pouting Gloria Lynn Berg . After tying up the hijacker , despite several bus - loads of people on this jumbo jet , nobody bothers to watch this guy who almost killed all of them . He 's just forced to amuse himself . The crippled plane , leaking fuel from all the hijacking shenanigans wo n't make it back to Hawaii so Masters will try to land at an Air Force base located on an island . Only the runway 's 300 feet too short ! Four army guys with little Bobcats ( the kind you rent to take all day moving a load of horse manure to the back of your barn ) , are gon na clear a 200 foot wide and 300 foot long swath through the jungle in 20 minutes ! No need for a bulldozer here ! Where can you find guys like this ? These guys could make a highway between Los Angeles and Las Vegas in 3 hours equipped only with tablespoons , a compass and a duck!After that hellish obstacle is fixed , Masters will try to land the plane as heroine pouts away . Hijacker giggles to himself and unsupervised gets free to make more trouble . He is finally subdued in a most retarded manner that I ca n't tell you . But , can YOU say Moby Dick?There are so many retarded scenes in this movie . The wounded captain is parked prone on the bar on the plane while Masters , who supposedly can barely fly , puts the plane into 60 degree banks and 20,000 feet per minute drops . The pilot should be french kissing the ceiling during these challenging stunts , but does n't budge an inch . I think that if they had picked different actors to play the parts , this moving could have been way better . If we need a pouting heroine in the movie , why not pick better known actress Bernadette Peters who seems to be perpetually pouting as well ? Besides , she can sing and the busty well aging Peters could feature some gratuitous cleavage shots . Now with the singing angle this could be a Hijacking , Let 's Land the Plane Movie MUSICAL ! Cast Luciano Pavarotti as the Pilot . They can sing a duet in the cockpit prior to the hijacking and there 's no way that tubby tenor would fly up to the ceiling as Masters works his magic on that big bird . In keeping with the musical theme , Masters could then be played by Andrei Bocelli , that Peters Can sing with as he lands the plane . Not only is he totally blind but only knows a couple of words of English . Now that 's a plot ! Think of the edge of your seat conversation between Masters ( Bocelli ) and the Air Traffic Controller : ATC : " Sir , please throttle back to 180 , flaps set to 25 degrees . maintain 230 heading"Bocelli : " What?"ATC : " Sir , arm spoilers now , confirm brake pressure at 250 psi . Maintain descent at 500 fpm"Bocelli : " What?"The hijacker could have been played by the late great Rodney Dangerfield who can spew a plethora of his one liners as he sits tied up and unguarded : " I get no respect . My wife is into group sex . Yeah , she screwed me in front of the judge and jury ! " Get the idea?MISSED OPPORTUNITIES The movie has your standard crying and moaning passengers that are never developed . Woody Allen could have been at the back offering one of his neurotic monologues : " She said I was great in bed . I told her I practice myself a lot ... " Now THIS is a movie!Also , according to similar movie " Executive Decision " where lazy eyed Steven Segal is mercifully killed at the start giving that movie a chance , 747 's have massive attics up top . The plane was introduced in 1969 so who knows what has accumulated in almost 40 years up there ? My uncle has old clothes , a sled , magazines and all sorts of stuff in his . WOuldn't it have been cool if Masters opened the trap door and saw a teary eyed Chevy Chase in a woman 's housecoat watching old Super 8 movies of his childhood ? Just a recommendation . So give it a chance , and as u lapse in and out of consciousness imagine how great this movie could have been if I had my hand in it ... sub_rate: 0.001968503937007874; NE_rate: 0.0
Here's the spoiler: At the end of the movie, a little piece of you dies. You'll spend the rest of your life searching in vain for that missing piece, but it's gone, it's gone. You'll wander the streets at night peering into your neighbors' windows as they sit down for dinner. Friends and family will try to pinpoint when exactly you turned into the walking dead. You'll answer their questions and concerns with a blank stare and some mumblings about a runaway testicle. When AMC inevitably makes Tomcats the "movie of the month," a series of mysterious murders will take place in your city. You'll wake up the next morning balled up on the floor of the kitchen with a faint taste of brains in your mouth. Then you'll crawl into the living room and onto the couch. You'll stare at the wall, wet yourself a little and then begin to laugh maniacally. Because once your dead inside, Jake Busey in a thong is actually pretty damn funny. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0

i just saw this movie on TNT and let me tell you , this picture was downright platitudinous and cheezy . But after a certain point , I began to laugh my socks off and to tell you the truth , they should classify this movie as comedy rather than action / adventure . The absolutely most hilarious scenery comes when the Delon and Kennedy are making loop the loop 360 's to avoid the French missiles that Wagner ordered to destroy the Concorde . Our fearless leader , Kennedy , decides to shoot flares out the window to stop the heat seeking missiles ? ? ? ? ? Dumb yet funny --- the kicker comes here though --- after one shot , the flare gun malfunctions and Kennedy tries to fix it in the cockpit and well ... if you want to know what happens get a hold of this movie . The silent parts of this movie include the full deficiency of plot----yeah lets have some action for 25 minutes than land in Paris and go ONE HOUR with passion scenes with prostitutes and flight attendants . Now lets switch to the saboteur for ten hours then a wasted rest of the movie and a plane that is visually breaking apart and the PASSENGERS DON"T EVEN SEE IT ? ? ? ? ITS RIGHT IN FRONT OF THEIR EYES!!!!-----final rating for this move--- ( 1/10 ) out of 4 stars if it were action 2 out of 4 stars if it were a comedy sub_rate: 0.03125; NE_rate: 0.0
This film is strange , even for a silent movie . Essentially , it follows the adventures about a engineer in post - revolutionary Russia who daydreams about going to Mars . In this movie , it seems like the producers KNOW the Communists have truly screwed up the country , but also seems to want to make it look like they 've accomplished something good . Then we get to the " Martian " scenes , where everyone on Mars wears goofy hats . They have a revolution after being inspired by the Earth Men , but are quickly betrayed by the Queen who sides with them . Except it 's all a dream , or is it . ( And given that the Russian Revolution eventually lead to the Stalin dictatorship , it makes you wonder if it was all allegory . ) Now , I 've seen GOOD Russian cinema . For instance , Eisenstein 's Battleship Potemkin is a good movie . This is just , well , whacky . sub_rate: 0.005747126436781609; NE_rate: 0.0
If a movie has an unimaginative , hackneyed history and flat characters it needs to make up for it by being really , truly amusing . You can get away with a lot if you 're funny . But while there are a few amusing moments scattered here and there in Grandma 's Boy , they are so far and few between that they can not begin to make up for the hack work the film displays in such abundance . The movie certainly does n't aim to surprise anyone . When Alex hides marijuana in his grandma 's house in a tea tin you know what 's going to happen later on and it does . The movie appears to have been written by a committee who did a study of fair comedies and grabbed any gag that appeared in more than one of them . The most interesting thing about the movie is its fairly unusual setting . The game takes place in a video game development company , which should be an interesting source for some clever comedy . But do n't be fooled , this is not a movie about video game developers . This is basically a college frat house movie in which all the frat boys have been shoved into a big room to play video games . The way the picture altogether fails to think through its setting and use it for original laughs can be seen in the character of J.P. J.P. is I think more - or - less conspired by the creator of Doom , John Carmack . At least inspired to the extent that he 's an odd genius who makes games . In the movie , J.P. is a weird , obnoxious geek who is despised and jeered by the company game testers . That makes no sense at all . If you are one of the most significant people in the history of video games ( as J.P. is supposed to be ) then even if you 're quirky and obnoxious , people will still admire and respect you on some level . If Stephen Hawking is obnoxious his associates still are n't going to make jun of him to his face . Also , game testers are just as likely to be geeks as J.P. , but in the movie they are basically frat boys . It 's a fun normal guys against the obnoxious dweebs movie . And while that formula has worked , very occasionally , in the past , it is absurd in the setting of a game company . If you decide to use an unusual setting for a movie , you do n't simply cram in all the conventions of movies from different settings into that one . Unless you 're a hack . About two thirds of the way through the movie I gave up . Something happened that I knew would result in a series of painfully predictable events . And I realized I had n't actually laughed at anything for the last half hour anyway . So I stopped ( although I did fast forward just to make sure I was right that they would follow the most predictable clichés , which they did).Normally if a movie 's bad I just say it 's bad and then run out of things to say , but this movie is such a phenomenally shoddy production that it deserves a long diatribe . Shame on the movie for luring a good actress like Linda Cardellini into it , then surrounding her with talentless nobodies . I 'll give the movie 1 point for giving Shirley Jones the chance to be the anti - Shirley Partridge though . sub_rate: 0.012779552715654952; NE_rate: 0.0
To quote Clark Griswold ( in the original Christmas Vacation ) : " WORSE ? How could things get any worse ? Take a look around here , Ellen . We 're at the threshold of hell . " Little did Chevy Chase know that he was describing the " sequel " to one of his best films . Dec Vacation II sets a new high ( or maybe it should be LOW ) in bad movies . My wife bought this DVD thinking it would actually be a sequel to the original , but we were severely disappointed . This picture is square . It bears no resemblance to the original , is an absolute dissipation of picture , and an superfluity to the otherwise good actors who had the misfortune to be part of it . It must deliver set a record on IMDb for the most tough reviews . I truly think we possess a good showcase to win a class action lawsuit to recover the money we consumers wasted on this movie . sub_rate: 0.062146892655367235; NE_rate: 0.09090909090909091
I watched the beginning twice , could NOT make sense of it , and it bothered me for the whole movie . So , work this out with me : Wayne ( the honest guy ) jumps on the stagecoach , disarms the drivers ( ! ) , steals the money ( ? ! ) , and takes off . Disarmed , one driver is then killed and the other wounded by the tough guys . Thanks to Wayne , who disarmed them , and then watched it happen . Then Wayne drops the money in the dirt , rescues the girl , rides into town , chuckles it up with Yak ( too tough about the dead guy , I guess ) ... and then later says he " found " the money back at the scene . And everyone 's okay with that . And he 's the good guy ? And I ' m pretty sure there were n't small , hand - held flashlights at the time . And Bell did his first phone demo in 1876 ... were they in houses then ? Am I thinking too hard about this one ?

I say this . If you want to see art , you go to an art gallery . If you want to see a movie , you go to a theater . Trying to intertwine art and film proves disastrous in " Where the Heart Is " . An interesting cast is wholly wasted in this superfluity . You like Dabney Coleman , see " Short Time " . You like Crispin Glover , see " Bartleby " . You like Uma Thurman , see " Kill Bill " . Above all , if you like Christopher Plummer , see " The Silent Partner " , because his character here , is a tremendous superfluity . In fact this entire production is an superfluity . Sure the human artwork is intriguing for a few minutes , so make a short , but do not submit an hearing to superfluous trumpery , masquerading as filmed entertainment . - MERK sub_rate: 0.056962025316455694; NE_rate: 0.0
This movie baffled me . I could not get a grip on it . Thought I might be missing something . Glad to see that most of you agree with me . This is n't always the case ( see my recent review of RE : Extinction).To expound upon the faults of this film any further would be a glorious waste of time ... so I will ... They're dressed like cowboys , but it 's modern times , right ? No ? I do n't get it ? ? ? When I picked up the box , I thought : ZOMBIE WESTERN ! COOL ! That 's how it was presented . Have n't seen that yet . Hope they did a good job . They DIDN'T ! They tried to create an iconic character that would spawn a series . They didn't . They tried to make an Aussie indie zombie flick on the caliber ( and perhaps riding on the coat tails ) of the very well done " UNDEAD " . They didn't . Okay , maybe they just wanted to make a confusing , disjointed , plenty of film salad that might ultimately be edited into something watchable . They DIDN'T ! This is the new number 2 on my list of Worst Zombie Movies Ever . There are really just the two so far , " DAY OF THE DEAD : CONTAGIUM " being the first ( not to be confused with " DAY OF THE DEAD " , which is one of my favorite zombie movies of all time ) . If you 're gon na make a zombie movie ( and I 'm not a zombie movie maker , I 'm just a connoisseur ) make a good one . Flight of the Living Dead is a good example of decent recent zombie filmaking . FYI.If you 're really forgiving , you might think , well , did n't they at least throw in something to make us feel like we did n't want our money back ? Guess what ... THEY DIDN'T ! sub_rate: 0.002840909090909091; NE_rate: 0.0
I do not find this display at all funny . I really think it is often worse than any of the other tremendous Disney channel sit - coms right now . Charlotte Arnold is an interesting choice to play Sadie , because she ca n't act . The jokes on this show exist awfully unfunny , and it makes it even worse when the only cast member that has a little bit ( and I intend petty spot ) of acting talent is Justin Bradley as Sadie 's brother Hal . Jasmine Richards and Michael D'Ascenzo portray Sadie 's friends . There both actually stupid and exactly tremendous actors . Two words that can really describe this display is rottenly platitudinous . It 's platitudinous humor that only little girls find funny because their brains have not developed yet . Now I ' ve explained my hatred for playacting acting and ugly humour humor , what 's next ? solid assumption premise of display show is unintelligent theme idea . She changed again ( not so sciencey an Ben - loving ) and suddenly nobody recognizes her ? It 's moronic . In summation , I hate display show nonetheless however little girls who do deliver have a concept amusing funny will enjoy it , so I guess that 's what they 're going for over quality .

This TV show is possibly the most wretched display of dogshit on TV 2001 . dreadfully predictable , obscene usage of ho motion photography , cheesy story lines . Chuck Norris is an abomination who should never have been allowed to be filmed in anything . The way he chooses to progress each episode into a public service announcement is actually vexatious . His playacting sucks hence tough that it makes a soul cringe with superfluity . I will give the series some credit though ... it does become entertaining at times , but not enough for it make any difference . With all the negative points this series has , i still prefer it over reality TV , it ca n't really get any more worthless than that . sub_rate: 0.1076923076923077; NE_rate: 0.07142857142857142
tremendous tremendous movie for Television . Once again Lifetime brings us the predictable triangle ; scheming bitchy woman out to get stupid unknowing wife of yet another stupid husband who does n't have a clue . I get antsy when I see these films . You may ask , why do I watch them then ? I have n't a clue . Usually by mistake . And the movie is so tough I ca n't get away from it . I wait for the bitch to get her come up - pence . And usually I ' m not satisfied in how she gets her just desserts . Now if you can believe our vixen , she steals embryos from the clinic , and how does one do that ? Without blood tests , DNA , inquiries and recommendations . She proceeds to kill the Realtor , Gabrielle Rose , who is on to her , in broad daylight in the front yard of a house for sale and no one sees her ? She kills the mother , Susan Hogan , and you could predict that surmise when the mother off handedly mentions she 's allergic to peanuts and that the pills to combat this allergy are in her pocket book . Guess what ? I wo n't continue on this . Finally you are left in the house alone with the wife and the bitch . Well good triumphs evil , but much too slowly . Victoria Pratt as the evil girlfriend decent adequate in the role , looking a bit too disheveled and obvious . Tori Spelling just stands around looking blank most of the time . She 's got those big big Bette Davis eyes that look like they 're popping out of her head . I liked her better in TRICK . And Tahmoh Penikett plays the husband going around assuring his wife there 's nothing too he and his ex - girlfriend , even though he 's spotted all over town being very chummy with her , standing half naked with her in his house when he sent the wife off to the city to stay overnight . Yet he continues to deny the romance . Lifetime never disappoints the viewers with their inane plots and stories about women and their stupid husbands .

When this movie was made in 1980, I was a teenager in the football stands playing as part of the audience. This was done at Mooseheart, Illinois. The big letters spelling out "MOOSEHEART" at the top of the stands were covered up with a banner in the movie. The director would tell us to cheer loudly at certain points, as if a touchdown was being made. St. Charles juvenile correction center is a real place less than 30 miles from Mooseheart, although I think it may have closed down recently. During one scene, they show a black woman and a white man in the audience watching the game. Right below them, you can see my sister Noel's head (she was 11 at the time). In the VHS version, I can only see the top of her head, but when I saw it on TV in 1981 I could see her whole head and my sister Jacqui as well.I thought the movie itself was OK for a made for TV movie. Since there's already a description of the movie here, I need not repeat it. It's worth seeing at least once. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
" Speck " was apparently intended to be a biopic related to serial killer Richard Speck . There is , however , not much killing to be found in this movie , and none of it is explicitly shown . The most disturbing scene in the entire movie is perhaps when Speck stomps one of the eight unfortunate nurses to death in her own bathtub , yet even this is merely implied , and not shown , save for a few unconvincing downward thrusts of Mr. Speck 's leg . The most entertaining part of this movie is most likely the voice - over , which should be a testament to the mind - numbingly slow nature of this movie . Every aspect of this movie is ugly . Unless you have a fondness for boredom , do n't bother . This movie only clocks in at 72 minutes , but it feels like an timeless . sub_rate: 0.01910828025477707; NE_rate: 0.0

First off , I just watched a movie on SHOWTIME called Survival Island . It says it was a 2006 movie with Billy Zane and since I like him and could n't sleep I thought I would check it out . Looked interesting . Watched it , and decided to look up on the IMDb who was this new face Juan Pablo Di Pace and OMG I could not believe it , this movie has been renamed THREE and will be a new movie ? ? It is playing again in 1 hr and 30 mins on Showtime Channel again and this date is May 28 and EDT or Florida time . You can check your showtime listings by title and see it . I wo nt get into details so you can see the movie but at one point there is a lady in a white bikini that goes into the water taking it all off , you see her naked body .... when she runs back out of the water you see her bottoms on . Funny , there are a lot of other deal ups too . I ca n't believe by coincidence I decided to look up this movie ... Go figure !

I read the book after seeing the movie and didn't care for it, finding it somewhat trashy; but trashy books often make good movies, and this one certainly could have. The story of a teen girl's exploration of her attractive power over boys, which she finds as irresistibly stimulating as it is doubtfully controllable, and which has an even tighter grip on her than it would on a normal girl because it affects her through her werewolfry--this story would have an obvious appeal to the young audience for which movies are made: an appeal of one kind to girls, and of another kind to boys: and I don't understand how the movie makers could be blind to that and turn the story into one with little appeal to anybody.To begin with, take the title (which is the best thing about the book): it's drawn from a Hesse quotation, also used as an epigraph, about a person running in fear and tasting both blood and chocolate in his mouth, one tasting as bad as the other. This is a wonderful metaphor for the heroine's state: torn between her human and wolf sides, savoring each but equally fearful of both. The movie dispenses with the epigraph, and instead introduces the character working in her aunt's chocolate shop! I can understand how the book's title might have suggested to the movie makers the erotically charged chocolates of "Like Water for Chocolate," and led them to want to link the same symbol to werewolves. But they didn't; so why is it in the movie? In the book the characters are in high school--or in and out, as with the Five, a teen gang who favor black jeans and T-shirts, and fall somewhere between being the heroine's nemeses and her pet peeves. In the movie they've become decadent twenty-something clubgoers. In the book the heroine is 16, just of an age to be discovering how her sexuality operates on the boy she wants, as well as on herself; she's the one who initiates the contact, then steps back, re-initiates, and so on. In the movie she's no longer a girl but a woman, and the guy is no longer a high school poet on the fringe of campus life but a fugitive from the law (and a comic book artist, to boot), it's he who comes on to her, in a manner as unattractive as that of her wormy cousin. She initially puts him off, but then gives in, as he's confident she will: hey, you know you want it. I would have thought a female director would have taken the chance the book offered to show a female protagonist in an uncompliant, proactive role; but no.In the book the heroine's clan is driven from their home because of the Five's delinquent behavior; in the movie it's because she went for a run(!). She's a great runner, prone to kicking off from building walls, and both she and her clanmates scale buildings in a trice; very like heroes of martial arts movies and very unlike wolves, or anything resembling them. In the book they don't turn into actual wolves, but things bigger than wolves; in the movie they're just ordinary wolves. In the book they metamorphose in "Howling" style, with crunching of spines; this is one of the things that make the heroine aware of the pain her body brings her, as well as the pleasure. In the movie the werewolves have become magical acrobats, taking great swan dives and transforming in mid-air, shimmering yellow like Tinker-Bell; it looks cool, means nothing.In the book the clan is a slightly white-trashy family that has relocated from West Virginia to Maryland. In the movie they live in Bucharest but all talk in different accents, none Romanian. In the book nearly the whole pack want to lead normal lives and agree that to insure that--and indeed, their survival--one necessity is to keep their true nature secret from humans. And so the characters keep saying in the movie; yet the head of the clan is some kind of underground boss--but apparently not a crime boss, since he despises criminals--and has a standing deal with the police, who supply him with "meat" for the pack. This seems a big exception to the rule of keeping humans from knowing; but maybe the police are considered safe because of their known tolerance for eccentricity and cult murder.At the end of the book the heroine learns she can't be something she's not when, in her effort to live a divided life, she gets stuck between the human and animal states, unable to be all one thing or the other. Her boyfriend isn't sure or strong enough to accept her for what she is, the pack can't risk having him around, and the two are forced to separate. In the movie she rescues him like Lassie, and they drive off to Paris (why Paris?), in an ending that's smiley-faced but not really happy, since the conflicts between their natures--between _her_ natures--remain unresolved.But the difference in the movie that hampers enjoyment the most is that whereas the book characters behave conventionally, within the realm of young adult novels, those in the movie for some reason have been made as annoying as possible. Every other line is a threat or some other kind of oneupsmanship: you'll be sorry; you don't belong here; you won't get rid of me; I gave you your chance; etc. I prefer to steer clear of people who deal in that way.There have been many good vampire movies, never a good werewolf movie. Had this one stuck to the book, it might have been the first.But no. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
No one expects the Star Trek movies to be high art , but the fans do wait a motion that is equally honest as some of the best episodes . Unfortunately , this picture had a muddled , implausible game that exactly left me cringing - this is by far the worst of the nine ( so far ) movies . still the fortune to watch the well known characters interact in another motion ca n't deliver this movie - including the goofy scenes with Kirk Ford Ford and David at Yosemite . I would suppose this movie is not worth a rental , and scarcely worth watching , however for Ford True Fan who needs to learn all the movies , renting this movie is about the only manner you 'll learn it - still the cable channels nullify this motion . sub_rate: 0.16083916083916083; NE_rate: 0.043478260869565216
This is a actually whacky job of miscasting -- about as bad as Hepburn playing a Chinese woman in DRAGON SEED . The lead part Hepburn plays is a combination of Granny from the Beverly Hillbillies and a faith healer ! This picture is even worse than Bogart 's Swing Your Lady , because at least Bogart did n't play a hillbilly -- he was just surrounded by them . And the dialog sounds as if it comes right from a Li'l Abner strip ! The problems do n't really end with the outrageous casting , though , as the plot is completely muddled and the " passion story " might make your head hurt . For no reason WHATSOEVER , married Robert Young falls for this Ozark bobcat . Was it her lovely personality that won his heart ? I doubt it , as she as the fiery " spitfire " the movie was named after and she really seemed to like fightin ' and scrappin ' and hollerin ' ! Was it her feminine charms ? With no makeup and fashions that looked like they were designed by Ma Kettle , I doubt if this was the showcase as well . To top this off , in the end , somehow Ralph Bellamy also fell for her , though once again , it really does n't seem to make ANY sense . So , here we have two city fellers fallin ' for a scrappy unfeminine she - beast played by Ms. Hepburn -- now THAT 'S a recipe for a good film ! sub_rate: 0.018796992481203006; NE_rate: 0.0
The only reason I rated this film as 2 is because Channing Tatumis beautiful however the whole film lacks emotion and was ho to watch . Usually I adore a good romance but this was just a dissipation of time , I did n't shed a tear despite it containing sad content it just was n't acted very well at all . I ' m no film critic but I just advise girls to avoid this really unless the only reason you 're watching it is to see Channing Tatum lol the rest of the film is wish and if he was n't in it ( not that his acting was any good ) I would have stopped watching much quicker . It 's a shame really because if the right actors were chosen for this film it could have had the potential to be a real tear jerker . ..

Randy Bowers (John Wayne) comes upon the Half Way House at just the right time to take a break from the trail, and discovers a slew of dead bodies inside, among them a man he was supposed to deliver a message to - Ed Rogers, proprietor of the establishment. He's observed by the dead man's niece Sally (Alberta Vaughn), from behind a hidden room, where she remained unobserved during the carnage."Randy Rides Alone" was directed by Harry Fraser. He uses a filming technique here as in other of his films, where he fast forwards the action from one location to another, usually involving a rider on a horse. It's pretty well done and appears quite innovative in these 1930's era Lone Star Westerns.Pre-Gabby George Hayes is on hand, sans whiskers, and this is the first time I've seen him as a villain. In fact it took a few scenes to realize it was him in a dual role, first as hunchbacked businessman "Matt the Mute", communicating via pencil and paper, only to turn into Marvin Black, leader of a gang of outlaws. Black's gang was responsible for the murders at Half Way House, in an attempt to coerce Sally into selling out to Matt/Marvin. Another staple player is here as well, Yakima Canutt as a Black henchman named Spike. Interestingly, Yakima portrayed a villain named Sam Black in another Fraser/Wayne oater, "Neath the Arizona Skies".There's a fair amount of time-killing horseback riding back and forth between Black's Gang and the Sheriff's posse, as John Wayne's character maneuvers to expose the bad guys. In the end, he saves the day by securing Sally Rogers' thirty thousand dollars, at the expense of destroying the Half Way House, where he exchanges some sticks of dynamite for the loot in a safe. Greedy Marvin Black attempts to open it with his six-shooter, and the explosion is a fitting end for the villain. In his best "Aw shucks" attitude, John Wayne falls under the spell of the pretty Sally Rogers, and alas, Randy rides alone no more! sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
As a kid , this movie scared me green . As an adult , I could n't stop laughing . I have not had the pleasure of watching this movie via Ford I caught it , instead , on a late Saturday afternoon , when there was perfectly zip in the theaters , and there was nothing left to do outside but rake some autumn leaves . I figured , this HAD to be better . I was wrong . The movie has some very good elements ; a body - divining mystic , a beatnik painter , couple of idiot ranch hands , an elderly history buff , and an " evil jazz . " Um ... I mean ... evil head . An evil head which will , as soon as the systematic hypnotism of each and every one present is perfect , be looking for its evil body . The solid story takes place on an evil " ranch " which apparently neither grows crops , nor raises evil livestock . As everything is declared by their resident mystic to be " evil , " you either roll your eyes dreadfully , or laugh til your sides split , depending on your mood . Me ? I laughed until I had tears streaming down my face . I remembered this picture fondly as one of those which actually SCARED me as a kid . But some kids are afraid of Santa Claus , too .. no ? Anyway ... if you 're into 50 's horror camp , then this is definitely a movie you should n't miss . If you 're looking for a good story line , this picture has that . It 's the over the top dramatics and sheer innocence of the prison that makes it thus horrid . The playacting was exactly tough , but it still had some good elements . Perhaps it rates a remake ... ?

It lacked a substantial history product and the playacting was not incisively the best . manage n't rot your prison . The picture is not what the trailers lead you to remember it is . I would deliver to suppose that I do n't ordinarily publish anything about movies on IMDb ( in fact this is my 5th one ) but this picture was such a disappointment that I registered exactly to get masses have not to do their prison or money . The history bank is that of a heist that is to occur and it looks like it had voltage to be honest but the things that happen in the motion exist a short far fetched to be credible . keep another picture rather , perhaps the inner humanity ? ? ? sub_rate: 0.2883435582822086; NE_rate: 0.0
First , I would like to admit that Chokher Bali was not my cup of tea . This movie was evidently not targeted toward the masses . It 's the type that critics would enjoy watching . The hype and publicity were quite misleading . I was expecting something very dramatic like Devdas . Understanding that the story and time - period demand it , I found the movie extremely tardily - paced . I'm a die - hard Aishwarya fan , and I regret to say that I thought she was miscast . The role of Chokher Bali required an actress who can portray herself as subversive , not innocent and naive . Everyone else gave a good performance . Tagore 's depiction of the human condition does come across the celluloid to give the movie an interesting theme . sub_rate: 0.0070921985815602835; NE_rate: 0.0
no really , i m not kidding around here folks , and i so ca nt believe how many people here have given it really really positive reviews ! oh wait , its the IMDB comments section , silly me . its interesting to note that at this date , there have not been enough votes to give this film a rating out of ten , yet there are dozens of comments that rave about the film . what does this mean i wonder ? anyway , the hand IS tremendous . quality change their personality and motivation and actions every scene , in order to keep the movie running along at something that vaguely resembled a pace . it was nt even dumb behaviour , that was there too , but the pure idiocy of the script transcended any dumbness the characters displayed . for instance : karl is disobeying an order because there are two dead bodies in the desert and " the killer is out here somewhere " so he forces everyone to travel 40kms in order to find the killer , disobeying orders and p*ssing everyone off . when the hero spots something nasty in the darkness and warns karl , karl tells our hero to stop being an idiot and that there 's nothing out there so they are all going home . next scene , he is refusing to let it go and must hunt down whatever it is . it is just a joke . yes , the monster is very impressive , but the crap that the humans say about it just tries to cancel out its interesting aspects , and the predator and alien rip off moments were very wordy . and the ending ... the ending ! ? ! ? ! jesus .... the worst film i saw the year , and i saw bug buster ! sub_rate: 0.012618296529968454; NE_rate: 0.0
This is a movie that should have been a mini - series as it tries to get too much information in too small a space . The whole story is constantly being bombarded with sub - plots , character introduction and meaningless pieces information that go nowhere . There is a underlying plot where boy meets a girl , she has doubts but gets married anyhow and then her doubts surface and she goes to see if they are real . They turn out not to be but her husband wo n't believe that she was not unfaithful and her almost boyfriend does n't want her as she was not unfaithful to her husband . With that said there are no less than 1000 sub - plots and character introductions that make this plot almost uncomprehensible . In the first 15 minutes you are inundated with so many things and situations that you just stop caring . You do n't care about any of the confused and screwed up cast that drifts in and out of the story like vultures feeding on a corpse . Each one comes in and takes some interest away from the viewer . After a half - hour , and completely disinterested , I stayed and watched the remaining two and a half hours out of pure morbid curiosity . I could n't imagine where it was going but like staring at a fire I just could n't get up and turn it off . The production values are superb but the resulting movie is a dissipation of time ; wash your socks instead . sub_rate: 0.007407407407407408; NE_rate: 0.0

This movie is a big movie . But after watching an endless series of bad horror movies , I can say that it is a little different from many I have seen . Not in the plot , which is a fairly regular slasher story , but more the way the scenes are cut . Murder Weapon gives us a lot of inane dialogue scenes , but they go on for a lot longer than in most movies of this type . Because of this some of the victims seem slightly less like cardboard cut - outs . Just slightly . I had a difficult time figuring out exactly what was happening at the beginning and kept wondering if certain events were dream sequences . My favorite scene is when two guys are on the run from the killer and take refuge in a car . In the glove compartment , they find a handgun . " Thank you , God ! " one of them happily exclaims . That guy 's head suddenly looks like a mannequin 's head , and it went on for just enough time for me to wonder , " What is that ? Where is that mannequin in relation to the two guys in the car ? " Then BOOM ! The head explodes and I figured out that it was supposed to be one of the guys in the car getting his head shot off with a shotgun . I love that scene , but the movie is a very big movie . 3/10 . sub_rate: 0.007633587786259542; NE_rate: 0.0

Started watching this but did n't believe in any of the characters . In particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just did n't work for me at all . The scenes between the bakery owner and the assistant were nice but the rest was just very slow . It was a very trivial movie and it gave me the feeling that I was watching play rather than a film . The characters were very ' stagey ' and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce . By the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant I was bored and did n't care what happened next and so I switched off . Glad I did n't pay to see it . Did n't laugh or even smile once . There seems to be a strange tendency for Americans to classify their films as ' comedy ' when they are funny peculiar rather than funny ha ha . I have finally learned to avoid what Americans term dark comedies which usually turn out to be gruesome weird and unfunny . Now it looks like I will have to be a bit more discerning when they call a film romantic comedy as well . Maybe comedy means something different when applied to a film rather than a series in America . I do n't understand why America can produce amazingly funny comedies like Two and a half men , Will and Grace , King of Queens but ca n't seem to produce really funny films without resorting to toilet humour . This film was n't gross or anything . But it was n't anything at all just one great yawn ... sub_rate: 0.007067137809187279; NE_rate: 0.0

OK , I read the director 's comment about this movie ( featured as the ' frontmost comment ' ) , and I have to admit that I can identify with his position . Micheal , I hope your career recovered from this particular setback and you went on to other , better things . I 've seen this movie in the MST3 K form . Even with all the chopped continuity and snotty remarks being tossed out by the robots , I saw a potentially decent movie with an ambitious set of ideas trying to struggle out from under the limited budget and limited actors available to it . And this is one of those films ( " Mitchell " is another ) where the MST3 K crew took a lot of cheap shots at the lead character even when she actually deserved better . You know they had some unfair fun at the actress ' expense because it made for a livelier episode . IMO , the fact that the movie actually tried to be ABOUT something , and had a few decent , effective moments here and there , should keep it out of the ' Bottom 100 ' ( " Tangents / Time Chasers " is another movie with a plot and a heart that does n't deserve to be there either).But it is still not a very good movie . I do n't blame the writer / lead actress for being who she is . It 's just that her acting and writing skills needed a few more years to mature before she could pull off a vanity project such as this or carry a feature film . The writing and characterization is inexpert and slapdash , and the dialog is often barely up to ABC Afterschool Special standards . The cast sincerely gives it their best effort , and the acting in general is definitely head - and - shoulders above abortions like " Future War " or " Space Mutiny " , but there are n't any really professional level performances here , with the exception of ' Big Joe ' Estevez , who is hammy but suitably intense . I never saw the full original cut , but MST 's sampling of " Soultaker " was representative enough to make these facts plain . Oh , and the film has Robert Z'Dar in it . That is , IMO , a real ' Kiss Of Death ' for any movie that hopes to be taken seriously . Yes , he 's big and scary looking in his role , but I just hate the guy as an actor . ( In real life , I wish him well and hope he is financially comfortable).There were little things I liked about the film . For instance , the camaraderie between the male lead and his dead buddy added some warmth and humor to the movie and made it a lot more watchable . The idea of an elevator in the hospital that opened its doors to the Afterlife was an inspired way to invoke some spooky vibes without springing for special effects , and I respected whoever worked that into the script in attempt to keep the budget manageable . It did n't really work , but it might have with just a little more tweaking . So anyway , Mr. Rissi , better luck with your other projects - your involvement with this misfire would n't keep me from watching something else you did if the ' buzz ' was good . And Ms. Miller has nothing to be ashamed of - she was young and ambitious , and the movie was n't THAT bad . sub_rate: 0.0016025641025641025; NE_rate: 0.0
This is an excellent example of an entreatingly defective b - movie . There are worse movies than this one ( Titanic for example ) , but this definitely shares the stilt of steaming dogshit movies . OK this was plainly shot in Kansas City , which explains why everyone is thusly crippled . The main guy looks like Steve Guttenberg , and is even more crippled than him ! I did n't even think that was possible ! In fact , him and the main girl in the movie are responsible for the WORST DRAMA EVER ! Its not scarcely that there acting was waaaaaaaaay over - dramatic , well actually it was , of course the script was unspeakable which combines for a pernicious one - two clout in bad terrible utterly unwatchable drama . The scarecrow , lets lecture about him . The whistling you hear every time he 's around is unintelligent , and obviously dubbed in . Now his costume , I can not pose over that - its a guy wearing burlap sacks and a unintelligent mask ! I plainly am dumbfounded , maybe if your 3 years old with brain impairment you 'd be scared of him / it . One of the characters , the token black guy actually , used the assembly : " This might be a chance to earn my red wings " when referring to trying to score with one of the girls on her period . Wow , um yea , that is the kind of dialogue you can look forward to . Oh , in the beginning when the scantily clad girl is running through the corn , why is it roped off ? I ' m pretty sure its not supposed to observable evident scarcely just one of the many obvious mistakes made throughout this ' film ' Another is defective bad dubbing for the identification number ( yup that s right ) , there all at the beach , and the one dorkaziod gets up the courage to sing a song and play guitar for everyone , and its so obviously dubbed its funny gratefully Thankfully , the scarecrow answers all our prayers and throws a spear right through the guy dresser chest when he 's tattle singing . Overall the gore like that is pretty good , this is one of those films when you rooting for these people to be killed by the killer . OK , there 's a scene where the 2 guys bury one of their friends in the sand , then stand up , whip out their peni , and urinate all over the guy in the sand . Who does this ? Really , imagine it " Hey , lets bury joe in the sand , then stand up and take out our genitals like its no big deal and pee on him " In fact , this brings up the homo - eroticism in this film , what the hell ? A good part of the beginning of this movie is the jocks standing around in there underwear in the locker room and corn field while there doing the hazing . What the hell is with that ? Traditionally , in film and real life , jocks get the girls and nerds do n't . That really does n't make sense as all nerds think of is girls and sex , and apparently all jocks think of is sports and being around each other in their underwear , I do n't get it . Lets get to the sex . As someone who watched this movie with me put it : " I ' ve never been so disgusted by heterosexual sex in my life " and its true . If you like hot A cup action , or ugly old woman boobs , then this film is for you . I swear , they found a girl with the smallest breasts ever and this is who they get to do the nude scene ? ? Then the ugly old woman nurse shows her bouncy ones a couple of times , and man , I just did n't want to see that . Now , I have to talk about the timeline continuity to this film , that s what really is just bizarre . It starts in the daytime , then they all head to the cornfield , and within like 2 minutes its instantly dark middle of the night , when they drive off from there saying their going to the beach - its instantly day again , and apparently they stay at the beach until night again , and until day the next day . SO basically these events in the film cover 4 days , without any of the characters needing sleep or anything , its really weird . After the main killings have taken place , it flash forwards to ' 3 weeks later ' and apparently none of these people actually care that they saw their friends brutally murdered ! The surviving people literally pop some champaign ! And that s when I realized the budget did n't go to the script , directing or acting , it all went to that freakin bottle of champaign . The ending . Stop reading now if you do n't want the ending spoiled for you , it truly is enjoyable . OK , so the end takes place in a church , and the scarecrow put his soul inside the diabetes kid body , then he fights with the steve guttenberg lookalike guy , and he fights him with a b - movie version of the power the emperor had in star wars ! I ' m not kidding , its so stupid ! So somehow , in the middle of the fight , the scarecrow 's soul jumps bodies into the guttenberg jr . guy , and then with the last amount of will he has of his own , he impales himself on a cross in the church ! Its awesome ! Some blood , but what s even better is that the cross is obviously cardboard ! You can see the bottom move off the ground ! Wow , yea have fun watching . sub_rate: 0.02376425855513308; NE_rate: 0.0
This is a classic B type movie that you'd rather not waste your time and see. It started well and i thought it will grow up as a good thriller, but i was mistaking. All movie long you get the feeling that soon something interesting will take place and it will suddenly turn into a tensed thriller, but that doesn't happen.

A movie theater with a big history of past gruesome murders reopens . Of course , the bloody killings start anew . Written , directed , shot , scored and edited with an appalling lack of flair and finesse by the singularly talentless Rick Sloane ( who later disgraced celluloid some more with the perfectly unspeakable " Hobgoblins " ) , this horrendously ham - fisted attempt at a slasher spoof strikes out something rotten in every conceivable way : the excruciatingly lethargic pacing , the painfully static , gritty cinematography ( there 's a stinky surplus of drab master shots featured throughout ) , an annoyingly droning and redundant hum'n'shiver synthesizer score , the flat ( non)direction , a tediously talky and uneventful book , the groan - inducing sophomoric sense of lowbrow humor , the bloodless murder set pieces , a pitifully unscary killer ( he 's just some wrinkled - up old guy in pasty make - up ) , the uniformly objectionable and unappealing characters , a dissatisfyingly abrupt ending , and lifeless performances from a noticeably uninventive form all ensure that watching this schlocky swill is well equally fun and rewarding as eating rancid raw eels drenched with sour vinegar . This crud wholly lacks the necessary raw charm and squalid vigor required to be enjoyable junk . Instead it 's only a bland , plodding and meandering strong that never catches fire or becomes even remotely amusing in a so - shoddy - it 's - smoking sort of way . Only a smidgen nudeness nudity and the delightful presence of the honest dependable Mary Woronov as a snarky , sardonic secretary provide a little relief from the overall crumminess of this filthy loser . sub_rate: 0.06206896551724138; NE_rate: 0.0
I do n't know any idiotic rock'n'roll cliché not used in this movie . Ouffcourz , rock enroll life is only sex drugs and parties and tons of supermodels trying to ride with you . Say it to stupid young boys . The filmmakers seemed to have read too much Guns'n'Roses or Motley Crue stories . I have seen everyday life of usual rock band closely and there are nothing to do with reality in this movie . If you are successful enough your life is touring touring touring . Its means that you are mostly in a bus and trying to sleep . Just sleep . Because you must be fresh , sober and clean in evenings . After live you have a little time to discharge your stage excitement . Then you have a bit time to have fun . But its not any luxury or dream .

I would probably want to fall this picture a 7 if not for the climax , which involves not really Snakes on a Train , but kind Train IN a Snake . The assumption was cooked up far more than likely over the course of a night of beers after hearing about Snakes on a Plane in product ( this , in fact , was released to coincide with that picture 's release ) . The joke is probably not lost on those who will look this out ; I do n't think there would be a soul out there who would believe this anything as a good action - thriller movement ( unless on an ironic spirit beyond the content for rational thought ) . It 's about a Australian nemesis placed on a woman who 's damned by her family for leaving with another humanity , and is soon seen sickened and coughing up dark slime laced with , of course , snakes . She and her beau go on a string headed for India India , and very shortly after the more - than - cliché characters are privy to snakes overtaking the train- with the originator woman becoming a snake herself . If it would be worth listing more about the picture I would , but there is n't decent time during 2001 2001 . All that can be said for the quality broker is that it 's nearly on - existent ; there are student short films with larger budgets . Maybe that was a wise calculation on the filmmakers ' goal , that there would be so many copies sold , scarcely for the joke gene solo , that they would re - coup their budget in 2001 first weekend . Because by looking at the sets ( the trains themselves change randomly in the middle of a scenery ! ) , the actors ( if you can scream them that , with 7 one other actor- the one with the very tenuous whisker who hits on the one womanhood throughout the movie- who benefited from the picture being produced ) , the FX ( likewise next to non - real , making the effects in Snakes on a aeroplane seem like Star Wars ) , and the real Ford snakes themselves , with the final immense behemoth snake something to behold in sci - fi movie channel terms . This all means , basically , that it is a laugh riot every step of the way ( especially , as cruel as it sounds , when a little girl becomes involved in a snake 's " attention " ) , with the very disregard for good taste working well in its favor . This being said , it is also 100 % disposable , like a B - movie sour - flavor lollipop . sub_rate: 0.09355509355509356; NE_rate: 0.044444444444444446

I swear , I had never seen such a bad movie as Half Caste is . Not only because it just makes no sense , is a huge piece of egolatry and self - confidence that makes me puke . Sebastian Apocada ( in Spanish Apocada has a similar pronunciation to " apocado " which means " out of life and happiness " ) makes here a one man army movie thinking he is Sam Raimi or the boys who directed the Blair Witch project . This is the Blair Kittie project , with an expensive low budget . The story , a couple of American Filmmakers that go to Africa to make a documentary of the Half Caste , is just no - sense . The way of filming , inserting high speed shots with slow motion shots , just revolts your stomach more than the stupid lines ( what the hell is that dialog about Bestiality ? ) or the lame performances . By the way , I do n't believe this cast ( or caste ? ) is American , they all look European to me . To finish this , just sound that the filmmakers made an intelligent move about selling the movie . They put a fake award achievement ( as most original film ) and a nice cover ( in Spain the cover had the Half caste image in negative ) , so I feel now unhappy , because I ca n't demand my 14 Euros back . sub_rate: 0.003937007874015748; NE_rate: 0.0

Art - house horror tries to use unconventional aesthetics to cover the fact that this is just another serial killer chiller which ultimately relies on pornographic combinations of teen sexuality and violent gore . The suburbs come across about as well as they do in every piece of Australian writing ( book or film ) since 1960 - surprise surprise , the suburbs have a dark underbelly - and the game is as artificial as any you ' ve seen . " The neighbours would never know about this guy , " one of the filmmakers says about Joel Edgerton quality character . " But he wholly completely plausible as to what he was . Serial killers do n't all have patches over their eyes and scars down their cheeks . They look like the guy next door . " Another trader in pornographic violence who sees a serial killer in every street . But the real insignificance of this film is in the fact that it 's a genre film that nobody saw .

I was thus disappointed in this movie . I am very familiar with the case , having read not only Mark Fuhrman 's book but also the far superior " A Wealth of Evil : The True Story of the Murder of Martha Moxley in America 's Richest Community " by Timothy Dumas . Anyone who watches MURDER IN GREENWICH should be aware they 're watching The Mark Fuhrman story , not the Martha Moxley story . This film is nothing more than an ego - trip for Fuhrman . Just watch his character strut around as if he is the second coming ( yes , even being ogled by women ) . The actors playing the kids look way too old for their roles and the flashbacks to the 1970s are totally unbelievable . If there is any hero to this story , it 's Martha 's family , her mother Dorothy and brother John . They kept this case alive for two decades before Fuhrman walked into it in order to make a name for himself . They , and Martha , deserve to have the true story told . sub_rate: 0.010416666666666666; NE_rate: 0.0

It is the atrocious hand . * * Spoilers * * Alright , David loses his task to a rapscallion . His nerdy boy is frustrated . The lavatory goes half . He gets a complimentary holiday . He goes along with David David and the original Highly . Their boats crashes . They remain on an island . They exist unintelligent and do n't yet get to appear at the nearby hotel . OK , indeed that 's that . What makes this motion wretched is the sense . It is thus horrid , hillybillyish , and unintelligent , you ca n't still laugh . ANd it 's not unintelligent curious humour either . I could n't laugh the full affair . sub_rate: 0.2795031055900621; NE_rate: 0.022222222222222223
I hope the people who made this movies read these comments . The stage was India , the game was nill , and the actors where thus humble budget ability rangers appears 5 genius to this debris . The fight scenes where so ho you could actually see the actors waiting for each other to perform the next movement . Camera cut - aways and inadequate lighting could not cover up the tatty effects . The lightning was hardly apparently unintelligent . The weapons looked like something out of a final fantasy game , and the double bow and arrow was merely ho as anything I have ever seen . Next movie you decide to make try investing in some wireless mics , better book and try actually spending some time on your stunts . Honestly there are shows on t.v . that play ever night and are thrust together in a few hours that look better than this one . Stick to martial arts ( unless its as inadequate as your acting ) then learn up quilting . sub_rate: 0.12290502793296089; NE_rate: 0.0
In Moscow , the priest Owen ( Vincent Gallo ) hires a team to guide him in the underworld to find his friend Sergei ( Rade Serbedzija ) that is missing while researching the legend about the existence of demons and an entrance to hell beneath the city . I bought this DVD based on the name of Val Kilmer and the interesting pictures on the cover . I exist totally disappointed since this picture is 7 of the worst movies I have ever seen . I do not understand how Val Kilmer accepted to participate in this production . There are two shameful reviews in IMDb promoting this movie and they are typically fake , written by users with only one inspection in this internet . There are two possible ways to visit this ho and tremendous film : my wife and I napped many times because of the monotony of this superfluous level , and we used the rewind button of the DVD to repeat each lost scene .

Well , for this loathing of a motion , I was n't expecting anything unspoiled . I find David David vexatious , and David David was passably full but there is perfectly no understanding for it to deliver a continuation . Somehow , this motion was yet lower than my expectations , still when I did n't deliver any . Does anyone think the Ford motion David with David David ? Well , get 's scarcely tell that David Jehovah wholly ripped it off in fashion overly many ways for the picture to continue justifiable . really David David was had the Australian same game lineation as Atlantic , with the elision of a few technicalities , it was zip but a carbon copy of a far - superior picture that was really Ford .

How? I wondered why I hadn't seen this in theaters, or even a single commercial for it, and then after I saw the movie, I realized I was duped HARDCORE. I am a big Transporter fan, and a big Blade fan, so when I saw this I imagined some killer fight scene between two badasses, lots of gunplay, a whole bunch of stuff. Instead, I got the Ryan Phillippe movie with a brief cameo by Statham and Snipes. The guy that does the audio and video in the crime lab got more screen time than Wesley. It was like renting a Jackie Chan movie expecting a bunch of kung fu and getting Erin Brockavich. I expect bad movies from Hollywood, but actors like Snipes and Statham should treat the fan base better. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0

At the end of the movie when I did find out it was Caddyshack 2 I was disappointed . They could have done better . Dan Akroyd I thought was bad . The whole story was high . Call this movie by another title , but do n't call it Caddyshack 2 . You give that great movie a tough name . Jackie Mason 's daughter when I first saw her looked like his wife .

While this is n't one of Miss Davies ' very worst films , it is pretty bad . And it 's sad that in a revisionist fashion , recent IMDb raters have deliberately over - inflated the scores on some of her films to make up for her being slighted in the past -- or so it seems . For years , conventional wisdom has been that Davies was a terrible actress and only got the roles she got because her beau , William Randolph Hearst , bought her way into Hollywood . This certainly is the image created in Orson Welles ' CITIZEN KANE . It is true that Hearst did use his considerable wealth and clout to build Davies ' career . With all this money , it 's not surprising that she made some excellent films and it is n't surprising that people got snippy due to all the extra attention she got . Sleeping with the man who finances your films is bound to get noticed . However , despite this edge , she also made a decent number of bad films and I think we really need balance when it comes to the scores of her movies . After all , no rational person could believe that as of today ( 1/5/08 ) , PEG O ' MY HEART and two other Davies films recently shown on Turner Classic Movies ( THE FLORODORA GIRL and MARIANNE ) deserved the exceptionally high scores -- ranking them higher than such films as HIGH NOON , BEN HUR , THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES and ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT ! ! In fact , MARIANNE would now rank as the fifth best movie ever according to IMDb with a score of 8.8 ! ! ! Considering most people out there do n't even know who Marion Davies was AND most of her movies were financial disasters , this is a serious problem ! ! However , she was a much better actress than CITIZEN KANE implied and initially broke into films before she began sleeping with Hearst . What sets PEG O ' MY HEART apart from these two other movies , is that MARIANNE and THE FLORODORA GIRL were pleasant little films -- while PEG O ' MY HEART is in some ways just unspeakable . Much of the reason was the terrible miscasting of Marion . While her French accent in MARIANNE was cute , in PEG her Irish accent just sounded bizarre -- not particularly Irish . Plus , and perhaps I 'm mistaken , but her continual use of the word ' ye ' makes her sound like she should be doing Shakespeare , not a film set in 1933 Ireland ! Also , there was a bizarre insistence that Marion should be the consummate multi - talented star -- so they had her not just act but dance and sing . The singing actually fit the scripts in some of her films , but here it seemed out of place and seriously detracted from the film . It just seemed like you could almost hear Hearst shouting out " see -- she IS a great actress --- look at her sing and dance " . Sadly , Marion just looked uncomfortable and out of place in many of these scenes . But for me , the biggest problem was the idea of having 36 year - old Marion playing such a youthful role . It was obvious that the character she played at the beginning of the film was supposed to be like the ones Mary Pickford played in the teens and twenties -- complete with the pig tails and plucky attitude . Miss Pickford COULD carry off these roles even though she , too , was n't a girl any more . But here , Marion had put on a bit of weight and looked at least 30 . No offense -- she looked fine for her age -- but she DID NOT look like a teen ! Oddly , with the millions that Hearts spent on Marion 's career , he never realized that the most important thing he needed to spend his money on was a good script and one that fit Marion 's talents . Believe me , I have rated several of her films very high ( I especially adore SHOW PEOPLE ) , but here she just could n't help but flop -- this film was a turkey . sub_rate: 0.0013245033112582781; NE_rate: 0.0
OK , first of all , who in their good head would make Ford and second , who would get it take for shooting ? I include I had no design of always watching this picture for that very understanding . The original Ford is one of my favourite films always and this exactly seemed like a degrading photocopy of it . I did learn it because my girl wanted to compare it to the original and we both agreed hours hours hours hours into this crap that it was amazing . First , as mentioned , they did it shot for scene . Where 's originality ? Why make a motion that is well gross EXACTLY the room it was done the first prison ? Why make such a picture to get with ? If you exist going to make something , make something that does n't play and progress it BETTER!Second , they used the accurate same book from the 2001 reading . The dialogue no longer works . It works fine and sounds gross for the 2001 reading , but seems funny and artificial coming out of innovative actors . Why not update the dialogue ? limp did n't drop the book , you could let rewritten . This picture had some really effective gift and they were wasted by imitation of the original actors . The player who played the cable salesman seemed like he was exactly playing David David David execution as the cable salesman in the pilot . All the actors seemed like the sole way they were given was be the characters from the original picture . David David may let seemed a petty creepier than David David , but in doing therefore , you loose the understanding you exist supposed to deliver for David . Having David masturbate while watching Ford undress was going also far and lost the innocence of the quality that I think David David captured therefore easily in his execution . David David David speech was annoying and David David was far likewise honest to act David . Her lines came off as person desperate quite than simply young and fun like Patricia David David execution . The sole honest affair I saw about the motion was that David David David was capable to give the picture with the scene Ford had envisioned . Ford wanted to give with 1 long shot going over Phoenix but could n't at the time so he had to settle for a series of shots cross - dissolved together . This film fulfilled that vision with a helicopter shot going into the window of the hotel . After that , though the film became a worthless waste of celluloid . If you are curious about how to destroy a wonderful film , watch this , but do NOT under any circumstances watch this BEFORE you watch the original . This is a faded photocopy of the original and should never have been green - lit . Stick to the master 's film , not the imitation . sub_rate: 0.23300970873786409; NE_rate: 0.06666666666666667

No matter what other people have said you can't review this movie without comparing it to the original, if it existed on it's own it would be a 2-3 out of 5 film but it is a remake of a 4-5 out of 5 film and so has standards to live up to and we need to see if it reached those standards. If the film was a re-working or, as in Planet of the Apes, a re-imagining of the original you would be able to look at the film in it's own right, only referencing the original. Imagine it this way, if someone took the model in the 'Mona Lisa', posed her in a different way, and painted her you could only compare the framing,concept etc to the original but if someone just repainted her in the position of the original you would have to compare it totally.That said this film doesn't just fail to be as good as the original it fails spectacularly, like it or not the original was one of the best movies ever made, the shower scene will never be forgotten, the remake was meant to be a celebration of Hitchcock but ended up actually degrading him and his master work.The degrading aspects of this picture were Vince Vaughn and Anne Heche. It's nothing to do with wether they acted better or not it's that the relationship between Norman and Marion in the original was really quite innocent, Norman didn't really understand sex, he had hardly any contact with the outside world and when he meets beautiful Marion and watches her change you feel that he is partly doing it from fascination as he doesn't really understand sex and his attraction to her,this makes Norman sympathetic and almost an anti-hero, you are on his side because he doesn't fully understand the world and is constantly fighting with himself and his 'Mother'. In the remake that whole dynamic is gone, I must admit to Janet Leigh not being my type but she is very attractive and you can see that, Anne Heche is really unattractive and so Norman finding 'her' Marion attractive is unbelievable if you add that to Vince Vaughn's Norman masturbating whilst looking at her and you get a Norman that is just waiting for a chance to jack off at any naked woman no matter what she looks like, who you feel absolutely no sympathy for, they further destroy Norman's innocent nature by putting the porno mags in his room. It destroys a character that we have come to like and feel sorry for, it's like re-making 'It's a wonderful life' and having the main character a pimp, totally degrading.The only other character that I had problems with was Rita Wilson as Caroline, Marion's workmate. In the original when Pat Hitchcock says the line 'he must have noticed my wedding ring' it elicits a response of laughter as she is absolutely kidding herself, when Rita says it it just seems plausible as there really isn't any other reason why any man would flirt with Anne Heche over her.I'll admit that I am very biased, the original 'Psycho' is my favorite film of all time, had the film been a reworking, with a different angle, then you could have turned these characters on their heads and it would have been perfectly acceptable.Hitch famously thaught the film would be too gory in colour and made it in black and white to lessen it. This also made the film more atmospheric and frightening in it's own way and it gave it a beauty that could never be captured in colour and it is a sad statement about how movies are de-sensetising the public that people have said how the shower scene was more frightening in colour. (n.b before people think 'he can't spell' remember I'm from England and we spell it colour)A remake should be just that, re made, this is a forgery, a complete copy and a very bad one at that. I could go on comparing but there is no point, almost everything is superior in the original. The only one thing that is better is the performance of Viggo Mortensen as Sam Loomis, John Gavin was very flat in the original (Hitch called him 'The Stiff' behind his back) and Mortensen gives a more believable if less likeable performance. William H. Macy and Julianne Moore are the only other actors that hold up to the originals.Overall a movie that should be labeled 'Expensive Embarrassing Failed Experiment. Only view if comparing to original or if original is unknown to you. But view original too' The movie would have got a 3 out of 5 if it were original or a reworking but as it is 0.5 out of 5 (for Macy, Moore and Mortensen) sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
Maybe this was * An Important Movie * and that 's why people rank it so highly , but honestly it is n't very good . In hindsight it 's easy to see that Chaplin ( probably all of Hollywood ) was incredibly uninitiate about the magnitude of what was really going on in the ghettos , so you ca n't fault him TOO much for the disconnect that affects a modern viewer , but the disconnect remains . More disappointingly , the movie is just clunky ; it 's as if Chaplin had no idea that movies had progressed in sophistication since the silent era . The set pieces , those involving both the Jewish Barber and the Dictator , do n't flow into each other ; they just sit there like discrete lumps of storyline that progress in fits and starts , moving SOMEWHERE but never arriving at resolution . Some are funny , some less so . What charm the movie has is strictly in the person of Chaplin himself . His parodies of Hitler 's speeches were the best part of the whole thing , and there 's no denying that he had a physical grace that was delightful to watch . But virtually everything he surrounded himself with was ANNOYING . Hannah was TOO DAMN American . The Storm Troopers were TOO DAMN American . Oooh ! Oooh ! One more thing ! I do n't know what purpose was served by having Garbage be the source of evil behind the throne . It almost seems like the film is saying that , if it were n't for malign influences like Garbage , Hynckle would n't have been that bad a guy . sub_rate: 0.003472222222222222; NE_rate: 0.0

In reality that happened : the royal mother in law and father in law lunched with the couple the day after the wedding and gave her the money in public . This troubled young Elisabeth so much that she never forgot the issue . We must remember she was only 16 . She was so chagrined that she kept a fear for sex all her life .

This motion features various well known actors which I usually like , so I had at least modest expectations when I rented this on DVD . I was highly disappointed . In fact I walked off for some snacks somewhere during the last half hour and somehow I ended up in the kitchen rather then going back to the TV . The actor performances where poor pretty much all across the board and none of the atmospheres in the motion felt very convincing . well all scenes had that " just a movie " feeling to them , I just sat there waiting to hear the director calling " CUT ! " followed by the crew having a little chat about the scene before moving on to the next . Since the movie is about gangsters most characters are tough and mob - like , the problem here is exactly that this solid tough - boy attitude is played out thus poorly that it just feels like a joke . The constant guitar - drilling soundtrack very tries to emphasize this atmosphere too , but when the same track is played the 18th time it just adds to the already warm tone of the solid thing just being fake . Maybe it was just a truly genuinely tough book , maybe it was only poorly executed . I ' m no movie critic , in fact I consider it rare to see something that very honest good , but this exactly just tough bad no matter how objective and forgiving I ' m trying to be .

First, a warning. 'How to Marry a Millionaire' comes prefaced by an apparently random five minute orchestral performance of 'Street Scene', a Gershwin-lite piece treated with the full pomp and ceremony of, well, Gershwin. Sitting through it takes some patience. If you have the DVD, rest assured, you can skip forward. You won't miss anything.The film itself is one of the perpetual disappointments of 50's Hollywood, a movie so bolstered by major star-power, opulent mise-en-scene and perfect high-concept that failure seems inconceivable. The title alone is perfect. Generation after generation, however, are forced to ask themselves - how is this so limp? The script is an albatross about the production's neck, a dead, smelling thing that chokes everything and everyone before they can really spark to life. There are no comic situations, just isolated moments that play for laughs. Whenever an actual comedy scene threatens to develop, the movie quickly moves on to other, less interesting things. A case in point - the scene where the three leading ladies each bring a date to the same fancy restaurant. One of them, short-sighted, refuses to wear her spectacles out of vanity. One of the dates is married. A classic Hollywood farce set-up, surely, complete with mistaken identity, angry wife, and probably a pie in the face for somebody? Well, no. Instead, we cut between the three dates as the ladies react 'comically' to things their partners say. Hit the punchline, and cut to the next limp joke. If in doubt, have Marilyn walk into a wall. Where's Billy Wilder when you need him?The three stars are almost a perfect diagram of the life cycle of the classic Hollywood screen goddess. This was one of Marilyn Monroe's breakout films, and the camera just eats her up, even though the script gives her nothing to do. She's so luminescent she almost seems newly hatched. Lauren Bacall, on the other hand, had been a major star for nearly a full decade, and she knows how to dominate the screen even when in frame with Monroe. She gets the only thing passing for a real role, and delivers the few good lines with a cynical snap - given the right material, she could have brought this thing to life. She's a curiously ageless actress - when she lies about her age in the film and claims to be forty, it isn't instantly ridiculous - and far less girlish than her co-stars, giving her a convincing authority. Betty Grable was far from ageless, and had a good eight years on her co-stars, putting her near the end of her Hollywood career. There's an air of desperation about her at times, stranded on screen with nothing but a toothpaste smile and a few scraps of comic timing, unable to play her real age but fooling no-one as a contemporary of this new, sharper generation of actresses, relying on the same old schtick that had served her throughout her career (for Marilyn-doubters, seeing the two juxtaposed in this movie helps to throw Monroe's subtlety and - yes - intelligence into sharp relief). She's also lumbered with the dead wood in terms of male co-stars (although all of the men - even the great William Powell - are guilty of lazy performances); she's unable to strike any comic sparks off them. Better to have given her role to the under-utilised Monroe, who could be funny all by herself, and left Grable with the repetitive Mr. Magoo routine.That the movie is as enjoyable as it is can be put down to the luscious Hollywood production, the sort that renders even the twee likes of 'By the Light of the Silvery Moon' watchable. But somewhere, buried beneath the flabby jokes and professionalism, lies the rough outline of a sharp, cynical comedy about the business of marriage that Bacall could have made sing - and new generations of movie viewers will sit down with 'How to Marry a Millionaire' in expectation of that movie, ready to be disappointed all over again. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0

There seems to be a solid U genre of tatty , tired old sex " comedies " out there , that say the same old things about middle class couples . Sort of like Friends , but with more soft porn and no wit . This film is no exception- it had situations so intimate I died from deja vu . People sat on couches , spinning out clichés about sex and relationships ? Check . Monogamy versus cheating with some woman / man who would never look twice in reality at some other woman / man ? Check . PORN The BADDIES!!!!111 ? Check . Some guy / girl in it who happens to be the only reason you 're watching this wish ? learn . The lesson seems to be- when it doubt , make a tired honest sex " comedy " about people no one cares anything about , in order to make some statement that everybody has already heard three thousand times before . That 'll get your film made . It 'll even attract some sitcom nobody in a big wig ! sub_rate: 0.0427807486631016; NE_rate: 0.0
This is movie is genuinely tough . I like to flip on the TV while napping and this movie looked like it would be something good to sleep through , and boy was I wrong . My body literally woke me up from sleeping and said " Hey ... this movie is tremendous ... you got ta watch it " . I love big movies with bad actors and stupid plots . Something about unintentional comedy gets me going . This movie is impressively stinky . I really do n't know how to properly express it aside from recommending you watch it just to see how tough it is . I mean , seriously , you should watch it with people .

Oh my lord , what were they thinking about with this one . It not only is frantically unfunny , but worse , a very good original was trashed in the bargain . Jane Fonda , believe it or not , actually turned in the performance of her life in that one . Even better than where she plays the whore in the other so called performance of her life . Maybe she is scarcely flat good as a crook . Any other prison , wow , what a dissipation of time . But she and Segal team up beautifully , so if you even remotely got a glimpse of anything funny in this baby , catch the anvil upon which it got beaten into a pulp from . Because very very very short of that one remains , to this ones horror . Nothing in this baby is remotely funny except for maybe a couple of moments when Dick and Jane are bulging lipped up as lepers and ca nt kiss ..... and uhh ........ oh my lord , that 's it ?

My wife and I were game and we thought it ca n't be as bad as the critic said - you know critics . Sure enough ... Give me a prison with the tremendous playacting , horrible tv employment , short use of the budget ( that has been mentioned over and over again as an self ) .

Has this ever happened to you? I go into my local video store and see a few new arrivals in the "film noir" section. I spy a copy of a new arrival of a film I have never seen called NAKED ALIBI. Its from one of those mail order video companies that offers (mostly) "dupey" looking copies of hard to find titles. The description on the box sounds good. The film has players I like (Sterling Hayden, Gloria Grahame, and Gene Barry). So I take it home and watch it. About ten minutes into this film I started having second thoughts. About half way through this film I started to dislike it. By the time the film ended, I not only disliked it, I despised it. The film opens with cops questioning Al Willis on suspicion of robbery. Other than being drunk, the police have nothing on him. When he pushes a cop and demands to be allowed to go home, the cops beat him up. Detective Conroy arrives, lets the cops finish the beating and then announces Willis is in the clear. Willis swears he will get revenge. Later one of the police officers is shot dead. With no evidence other that Willis is "sore" about the beating, Conroy make Willis his sole suspect, despite the fact that his boss names a pair of mobsters as suspects. Conroy arrests him, but for lack evidence Willis is released. The next day two more cops are killed by a bomb. This time Conroy goes to the Bakery that Willis owns and tries to beat a confession out of him. Conroy doesn't know it but a local newsman whose paper has been accusing Conroys department of police brutality snaps a picture of Conroy trying strangle Willis and Conroy is fired. But Conroy continues his pursuit and Willis flees to Mexico where Willis has a mistress. Conroy manages to convince his mistress (who Willis treats rather rough) to help him prove Willis is a killer. What this film lacks is a convincing script. The script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed. Things happen, characters personalities change, plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it. Other than the fact that Willis likes to tip a glass now and than, there is nothing in the early part of the film to make us think that he is a crazy killer that cheats on his wife. He treats his wife, his kid and employees well. Early in the film, one gets the impression that its Conroy is the one whose is a loose cannon. He seems to casually approve of police brutality. Conroy, for no reason is convinced from the very start Willis has criminal past. He seems to operate on the motto of the old Communist Bulgarian secret police; "Everyone is guilty of something, we just have not found out about it yet." Later Conroy shows kindness to Al's mistress and young son, now we are supposed to like him. Sorry! The early impression I got of Conroy stuck with me too long. And he is also a dumb cop. Only after he is fired and goes to Mexico does he run a background check on Willis and discovers that a warrant is out for him issued in Maryland. Why didn't he think of this before? Because this film hadn't used up enough running time. The cast is good. Gene Barry does well considering how poorly conceived his role of Al Willis is. I'm big fan of 40's and 50's crime thrillers but not only did I not think this film was good, it left a bad taste in my mouth (something many modern films do, but older films rarely do). sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
When I borrowed this movie , I was n't expecting a high - quality performance , but this was only lamentable . Most of the playacting was indeed incredibly big that you could n't easily get into this movie if you tried . There 's zip quite like seeing a kid announce things like " Oh no ! My Dad is invisible ! " or " I wonder what this does ? " in the same monotone that one might announce traffic advisories over the radio with . There are some good actors , but they exist wasted on smaller parts . The story is decent , though it would be fairly easy to guess , considering that there are n't too many real game changes . Lots of holes , too . For example , the Dad is inconspicuous , and the inventor figures out what part is needed to make him visible again . So the boy goes and steals the part from an electronics store . Could n't he just ask his Dad for the cash?This shows up in the Comedy category , but most of the comedy in this picture was reasonably dense , like the Invisible Dad taking off his clothes while invisible and then almost reappearing naked during a meeting , or walking around with his head covered at all times . Funny at first , but it gets old.2/5 , because it is watchable , and it 's one of those movies that are funny in their own way ... like the monotone exercise of lines . sub_rate: 0.05303030303030303; NE_rate: 0.0
Last night , I got bored and decided to watch a movie called ' out kold ' which I had once bought with a solid fortune of other tatty movies from a videostore . Seemed like a good old action movie , so I took out the chips and coke and was ready for a relaxing evening . Well , the pain started right from the beginning . The main character is a boxer who is the nicest guy I possess ever seen . As the good person he has to be nice of course , but he is just a pussy ! That totally does n't fit with a boxer that has 28 KO 's and starts working for a pimp to earn some extra money . Even nice guys can still be cool . Well , then came his first fight while he was working for this pimp . Every clout was clearly missed and that became even more vexatious because the sound effect were n't synchronised with the punches . Then there is this altogether wretched playacting of the solid form , and you have decent reasons to leave this movie for what it is . I gave it a 1 because I have never seen such a tough movie . sub_rate: 0.06074766355140187; NE_rate: 0.0
There's not really that much wrong with Crash of the Moons. Basically it's a few episodes of Rocky Jones, Space Ranger merged into a film. It is extremely dated, however. Winky's treatment of Vena is a good example of this. One has to remember that it was geared to be shown to children in the 1950's. In this respect, it succeeds. If you like children's sci-fi from the 1950's, go ahead and take a look at it. You'll see John Banner in a pre-sgt. Schultz role. He does a pretty good job in it. All in all, I'd give it a 6 out of 10. Not great, but not bad. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0

" Milo " is yet another answer to a question nobody ever asked . Do we really need more slashers?I for one think we already have more than enough . I guess the professional marvelous guys overcharged so in this one we deal with a murderous kid that 's also a zombie or a ghost when he feels like it . A long time ago , he drowned but that did n't bother him and he still kills people("Friday the 13th",what 's that?).One day , his survivors have a big reunion and as a surprise twist , Milo comes to pay them a visit . Through some really bad shots that show everything except the murders the cast is thinned out till only the final girl is left to find out Milo 's dense , I mean dark secret . She and her friends have been dying to know . Once discovered , Milo goes on yet another murderous rampage(isn't it his bedtime yet ? ) and the girl , well she screams a lot . The acting is not even bottom of the barrel , the barrel refuses to be associated with it . Milo can be one creepy bastard from time to time I give him that , but some movies just ca n't be saved without a great book or uncalled nudity . sub_rate: 0.017699115044247787; NE_rate: 0.0
veneration and Desire is of interest mainly to Kubrick obsessives , who can plumb this ostentatious clap trap for signs of his still - to - come greatness . Kubrick was right in seeking to ensure that the film was not screened or available on legitimate video . He considered it unenviable and inexpert , and he was correct in his evaluation . This is a weak and ho film -- at 68 minutes it still seems longer than " Barry Lyndon"!--it nevertheless is of historical interest , and has its genuine absorbing moments . It 's a difficult film to find ( only " unofficial " copies are in circulation ) , though perhaps this may change if Kubrick 's estate relents and has it released on video . Recommended only for Kubrick enthusiasts . sub_rate: 0.03676470588235294; NE_rate: 0.0
The Salena Incident is by far the director , Dustin Rikert 's , best motion --- which is n't saying much . In his past films ( and I use the term " films " loosely ) , the director takes ideas from Hollywood blockbusters and severely marginalizes them . The Salena Incident is no different . The movie is basically Ford Air meets Ford done with the semblance of your fair film school production . The motion is riddled with out - of - stress shots and plagued by exceptional effects that would suffer trouble rivaling most high school computer animation classes . For example well every on - silver explosion is the same fire effect matted over the silver . The weak effects and product note are only compromised by a flawed game and rocky dialogue . In a sentence , the news strings together like an exposition of overused Hollywood clichés . The picture begins with the worst CGI Alien ship ever made crashing into the worst CGI earth ever made and a team of army somethings going down to investigate . Next a coach of prison transports , carrying the worst of the worst from across the state , is overthrown by the prisoners with the help of their light girlfriends armed with silicon implants . The prisoners escape and run into the town of Salena where they encounter the aliens who ... SHOCK ... have escaped from an alien prison transport carrying the worst of the worst from across the galaxy . The prisoners , and their captive police armed with only guns and sad puns have to fight off the aliens and escape the town before the International Space Alliance * rolls eyes * bombs the city into oblivion . The sole real enjoyable parts of the motion are when the actors ( who are clearly undermined by the book ) are given the freedom to improvise and also when they fight off the smaller of the alien creatures in a flurry of gun fire . Other than that , the motion very is n't worth anyone 's time let solo the credit that the DVD is made out of . How tremendous was it ? Let 's just sound the Secretary of Defense is about 90 years old , works in a room that is well equally high tech 1950 's real estate office and is wearing a Looney Tunes tie . Yes , if that was n't clear enough before , THE MAN IN CHARGE OF THE PENTAGON IS WEARING A TIE WITH BUGS BUNNY AND THE ROAD RUNNER ON IT . The movie basically culminates ( HAHAHahhaaa did I say culminates ... ) with the last remaining soldier running into the group of prisoners and guards and the new formed team fighting their way away from the vicious aliens --- which for some strange reason leads them straight back to the Alien ship ? yeah ... The movie has heart but is riddled with horrible direction and even worse camera work . Someone seriously needed to slap the DP and tell him there is more to cinematography than repetitive , stagnant , chest - level shots . This movie really is n't worth renting ( if it ever makes it that far ) being that it 's not as horribly bad as the last films made by the director which reduces the laugh - ability , but it 's nowhere near watchable cinema . sub_rate: 0.04974271012006861; NE_rate: 0.0

I watched this because of the description and cover art and yet again was deceived . I am getting sick of all these new stupid straight to DVD horror movies . Once in a blue moon 1 will be OK . It started out with a confusing scene and then jumped 30 years and showed a couple one night during a thunderstorm which was OK because I like storms and it set a nice mood . Then it turned into a cool road trip where they ended up at a diner encountering bizarre people . The rest got weird and then got confusing .

This movie reminds me old B movies , but not in a good way . When I saw the first scene I thought it was going to be a spoof of one of those early SF films . The tremendous acting , the plastic props and the noticeable visual effects gave me that impression . But no , the movie is really that bad . The story is a perfect trumpery , the effects are below the level of a TV production ; even the redaction is a plenty .

This is a very interesting acquaintance! "Two-fisted tales" contains three foolish and childish episodes - genre isn't actually horror or action, more like something in between. Where's the suspence? Where's the fun? Where's the common sense? Definitely not in here but if you don't expect to get it, you don't necessarily miss it.First segment is called "Showdown". It's a violent, absurd western. I failed to understand the whole idea of it. "King of the road" is a stupid story starring Brad Pitt. At the time of "Two-fisted tales" he was just a pretty face who really didn't know how to act yet. Luckily he learned the skill later and now he's a fantastic, talented actor - one of the big ones of the younger generation. Story is almost ok in all of it's stupidness. Final episode "Yellow" is the only segment that's almost entirely successful. It's foolish but funny. We have to thank Kirk Douglas for that.This movie is something to watch when you sit in an easy chair and eat popcorn. (I should know, that's what I did) If you loved "Tales from the Crypt", you'll love "Two-fisted tales" too because basically it's all the same. I understand these three episodes are actually extremely rare "piece of art" and very difficult to find anywhere. I have the whole package on VHS but I don't think it's a big privilege. You'll have to be a fanatic Brad Pitt fan to search it out. Otherwise don't bother, it's not worth the effort. Silly crap. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
This is by far the worst British comedy ever , how it made it past the first episode let alone the pilot is beyond me . The playacting is faint from the independent quality played by Ben Miller to Sarah Alexander ( from the fantastic coupling)right through the form . The game / history lines were unfunny and very really predictable using many worn out ideas . A very unspeakable series to endure but sadly put in a time between two excellent shows . describing it as Britain 's solution to ' Meet the parents ' does a disservice to ' meet the parents ' and is equally well equally clean as an honest shoe that has a run around with the category dog . Britain should have learned that rip offs from other countries never work from looking at America 's sad attempts at doing so . sub_rate: 0.11486486486486487; NE_rate: 0.0
First Off , I am a huge fan of Robert Blake , always have been . This movie came on Movieplex last night 10/13 , and the title interested me & of course the star . But after watching it I was left more confused than I was before it started .... There are some good scenes , and I thought they would lead somewhere , but they did n't , it turned out to be an " anti - cop " " anti - buddy " " anti - hippie " , pretty much " anti - everything movie " , with an exceedingly confusing plot that also went nowhere . Robert Blake is great as the lead , well equally great as someone could be with this tough movie , I am still a huge fan of Mr. Blake and love his acting even in crap like this ... But this drug induced 70 's tripe , well ... better stay away from this one ... And , that ending , what a pisser . sub_rate: 0.01694915254237288; NE_rate: 0.0

I did n't know what to expect as I never saw the trailer and such ... but what I did discover simply by watching the first 10 hours is that this picture is the worst I possess ever had the misfortune to see . I wish I could kick it this film a 0 rating . The first 10 hours were tough but as soon as it goto the party scenery I wanted to barely get a coma it was actually poorly done .

Its got inadequate humour , natural and crude comedy at best and focuses on inadequate exceptional effects to fill 80 % of its time . I am sure a few people in Hollywood will be out on the streets after this film bombs . Also How can 39 people ease this movie a 10 . I mean get real anyone that gives this movie a 10 either has some mental issue and or works for the film society . This motion should average at 1.5/10 instead of its current 2.3/10 due to the people that ranked it 7 . Truly sad . sub_rate: 0.10931174089068826; NE_rate: 0.07407407407407407
I wish that all the mockumentaries and horror spoofs would go away . If you are going to investigate loch ness .. do it for real . Enough of the bull * * * * . Same with horror and sci - fi .. if you are going to make a movie and it is supposed to be scary .. make it scary .. not funny . I hate when watching a horror movie and the character is fighting for their life(or running or whatever .. their life is at stake ) and they are cracking jokes . This never happens .. cmon where have all the good directors gone ? I think horror and sci - fi have really gone down the tube since the 70 's . I long for the days that a horror flick was scary .. all this " scary movie " dogshit is for the birds . This film is also for the birds . If you really would like to see a good investigation or here serious talk ... don't expect it in this video . sub_rate: 0.00546448087431694; NE_rate: 0.0
This picture is worse than tremendous ! It took a honest history game and turned it into schizophrenic cinema . The photography is Ford inexpert . . . looks like a 5th graders household movie task filmed with malfunctioning 8 mm kiddie cameras . . . the editing appears to have been done by somebody having psychotic flashbacks ( while on drugs and booze ) , with scenes cut short , followed by other , unrelated scenes , then chopped segments of scenes pasted in . . . altogether unnecessary and free nudity . . . missing scenes . . . daytime scenes inexplicably turning into night - time scenes , then suddenly back to daytime . . . obviously no continuity . Tom Skerritt , Wendy Hughes and James Mason 's good playacting skills exist wasted , as are the talents of the " key " supporting form - ( draw the villain and the Anderson women - really inexpert acting ) . This movie is a good candidate for a remake , still with Skerritt and Hughes . . . just deliver it professionally done this time . sub_rate: 0.1; NE_rate: 0.0
" Death Wish 3 " is the movie equivalent of a shooting gallery . All the characters ( apart from Bronson 's Paul Kersey , of course ) exist merely to be killed , either as " provocation " ( the good guys ) or as " retribution " ( the villains ) . The music simply pours on the mindless violence ( people even get burned alive and blown up ) , turning this into an urban version of " Commando " ( and Charlie , like Arnold , seldom bothers to protect himself from the enemy gunfire ) . Fans of this short of affair ( and , plainly , there are many ) will enjoy it , others .... beware . ( * 7 ) sub_rate: 0.0390625; NE_rate: 0.2
I rated this 7 better than amazing because I liked seeing India from India in something once -- still if it was the same part . 5th , the conception is kind of precious for a little , but not an full picture . The composition was thrust and contrived . I possess the belief that the picture suffered the most during redaction . 5th , Ford Ford ever looks like her eyes exist cut -- yet when she 's not trying to serve it . She 's scarcely not amusing . She ever plays some variety of misfit daughter who triumphs by being herself -- ironical , considering Ford seems to ever be a impersonation . I would really like to learn her in something good . I truly want to cave her a fortune , but she is ever cast in these trite roles where she wiggles and makes faces and somehow that 's a honest thing?Finally , the unit " I ' m jerk Dork section segment was ripped off Ford Ford Ford Ford Nerds .

This movie was strange mainly because the plot was thus incoherent . The title refers to a vicious wind which renders the surface of the earth almost uninhabitable when it blows , but this seemed to have nothing whatsoever to do with what was going on . The picture seems to be an exceedingly short rip - off of Bladerunner ie rogue android being chased by bounty hunter(or ruthless cop in this ) . Luke Skywalker turns in a surprisingly good performance as afore - mentioned rogue cop . Nothing seems to be resolved at the end of the movie , we never find out anything of any substance about the android or what his intentions are . There is one baffling scene where Bill Paxton(who has kidnapped the android ) plays one exceptional song in his cardboard airplane for no particular reason(the song is called " Shape of things " , by The Yardbirds ) . This happens again in a later scene where the same song is played for no apparent reason . Does this song have any relevance to the movie ? Do n't think so . sub_rate: 0.02631578947368421; NE_rate: 0.0

David Lugosi is a real enigma . In the early 1930s , he was on top of the world after appearing in Dracula . Yet , again and again , he made filthy decisions regarding his career . Perhaps he had a bad agent , perhaps his drinking and drug use had a part in it or maybe he was just crazy . Regardless , he ruined his reputation by appearing in pretty much any film -- ranging from excellent horror films ( such as THE RAVEN ) to big - budget flicks ( like NINOTCHKA ) to grade - Z flicks for the cheapest and shoddiest of studios . Interestingly enough , although he agreed to do this tremendous film , he actually turned down the role that later went to Boris Karloff in FRANKENSTEIN ! As for this movie , it is a really whacky an horridly produced WWII propaganda film that featured a dumb game and wretched redaction . Lugosi spends much of the movie murdering saboteurs -- not a bad thing at all . But at the end , we find out that he is himself a Nazi plastic surgeon and all the American - looking men he killed were actually Japanese ! ! ! ! The funniest part of this is during a flashback . You see Lugosi talking to a group of Japanese men before he changes them to American - like men . When the camera scans them , the men are clearly Asian . But , on all the other non - close - up shots , they are all VERY Western looking -- many with bald heads ! ! They looked absolutely NOTHING like Japanese men . I suspect the plot must have undergone a re - write and this might account for the obvious mistake . Or , it could just be shoddy production values and editing . In fact , early in the film , they show a street scene in the city and all the cars ( circa 1942 ) are honest Model T Fords -- obviously from stock footage ! ! ! The bottom line is that the film is tough but also very dense . Unlike PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE , it 's hard to laugh at the ineptitude -- just be put to sleep by it . sub_rate: 0.02544529262086514; NE_rate: 0.0

Her bit-part as a masseuse, in the lurid sequel to the original 'Emmannuelle', evidently gave someone the bright idea of putting a spanner in the works of the French soft-core series' gambit by inverting the Caucasian carnality and casting Javan stunner Gemser in a leading role in this, the rather tame first of a series of sexploiters that became increasingly depraved as sleazier directors took on in-name-only sequels.Someone (and surely not the English-language over-haulers Warner?) was also anticipating an 'A Star Is Born' type meteoric rise out the results, judging by the way the actress is credited merely with the eponymous moniker of the on-screen heroine, albeit with a couple of consonants sacrificed as insurance against litigation.Gemser's tenure in the series saw her as an 'intrepid' photographer, allowing of course for all manner of subsequent globe-trotting adventures. But, whilst she may well have been one the very most beautiful actresses on the screen at that time, any thespian talent that may have been there to discern becomes mired in the same sort of unfeasibly facile cogitation ("I have to confess that since I've been in Africa, I find white skin less appealing...") that was to be found in the French films.And in this particular entry, much to the consternation of the raincoat brigade the essence of on-screen carnality is as much to be found in puerile symbolism (pumping engine pistons!) as it is in prosaic couplings - although naturally these include generous dollops of 'exploratory' lesbianism. Connoiseurs of kitsch are however guaranteed a continuous stream of aural delights, what with such epithets of ethnographic wisdom as "I do nothing to be a perfect black, she does everything to be a perfect white". sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
= = = = = = = = = = = great SPOILER================================== This is a tremendous movie with no likable characters . So many clichés and senseless scenes . It needs a good editor but then there might not be any movie left . Please save your two hours . The only decent and unpredictable scene in the movie was when the younger brother refuses to stop his brother from killing himself . The description read " moments of dark comedy " . Perhaps I missed those when I blinked . The horrible characters start right with the funeral . The funeral goers are laughing and complaining about the food while at the funeral of a very young man who has committed suicide ? Then the father makes digs at the only son left ? Right at the funeral ? How is it that the next door neighbor whose husband cheated on her with Sigourney Weaver 's character is the bad guy for telling the husband ? The father does n't even know his son can play the piano though everyone else around him seems to know he is a great pianist . The movie tries to shove every dramatic cliché possible into one movie : father over - driving athletic son to succeed , dysfunctional family losing a chosen son to suicide , the son left feeling lost and alone , drugs , marital affairs , child conceived via affair but raised as husband 's son , incest , homosexual tendencies , bullies , possible terminal illness , etc , etc , etc .

If you are going to make a movie from any book , be sure that the characters are consistant with that book . This picture not only defied the Biblical story that has been told for thousands upon thousands of years to children one way or another , but it clearly took liberties that no version would probably ever try . At least the Lord of the Rings is faithful enough to the books that people understand the story more if they read the books than this " Noah 's Ark " tried to . sub_rate: 0.031578947368421054; NE_rate: 0.0
Even with it 's low budget this movie could have been worth watching if there was a story to tell here . It started out pretty good , and fairly engaging and believable . The actors and characters were interesting although there was n't much character development . My favorite scenery was when they were all eating their rations . Some seemed to hate it , and some seemed to think it was n't too bad . The story starts out very airtight . And then ... And then it dipped into a little horror which is usually a death sentence for most sci fi . Suddenly no scientific basis for any of the goings on . No real believable end game for the villain ? No real explanation of what 's going on . Generally if a movie has to use the F word for every other word it usually spirals down from there too . I still get offended believe it or not . I often wonder what inspires people to make bad sci fi ? Is n't there a universe of fantastically good stories out there ? Do n't people feel like they are wasting their time and everyone else 's when they put out stuff like this . Why do we get so much fair sci fi like this ? No female actors / characters either ? None at all ? This had the makings to be another " Predator " but alas fell far far short . My final comment - poor editing and finally too low a budget to build a real campfire ? What gives ? My advice for any low budget sci fi movie production companies out there . Make sure you got a good story before you start , and edit out bad special effects - it 's better we see nothing than something that looks fake or ridiculously fuzzy . sub_rate: 0.00625; NE_rate: 0.0
My jaw fell so many times watching this flick , I have bruises . Okay , granted , I really was n't expecting the quality of , say , The Others or even Thirteen Ghosts ( the new one , which was just frightening and is still head and shoulders above this insanity ) . Someone else noted the thin characters ... I would n't call them " thin " . " Thin " implies there might be something to them . How about almost non - existent ? In no particular order we have : The Girl Who Will Scream ; The American Who Will Figure It All Out ; The Macho Guy Who Will Just Bull Through Everything Until He Gets Killed : The Wise Black Man Who Will Die Early ; The Extra Guy Who Is There To Die First ; The Extra Woman Who Is There To Play Tough . That 's it . That 's your character list and that is what they are and what they remain from beginning to end . If they were " thin " they might , at least , change a little bit from beginning to end . But they do n't . Well , okay , the American guy decides he 's going to stay with the fieldwork at the end and the Screaming Girl goes back to wherever she came from . That 's the change . Other than that , they all act according to their assigned roles and rarely betray any real emotion when they finally meet up with the menace . Now , the producers get props for an original menace , I will say . I had understood the story was going to be " Tremors " but with ants instead of giant worms . I give the writer credit : these are very cool , very scary ants and what they do with bones is excellent . ( The first time the " bone snatcher " appear , I admit I jumped a few feet.)Unfortunately , the very cool concept becomes Alien in the Desert very quickly . We get a lot of commentary on ants that may or may not be true , but we do n't get much of the mythology on which the menace is based . And we get every monster movie cliché ever made . People go into places they know they should n't and when they have no compelling reason to . Moronic characters try to hinder our heroes and die for it . One character does double duty as " scientist who does n't want to kill the monster but study it " . A Very Cool Gadget is introduced only so the American can tell everyone something about ants that , gee , I hope everyone knows anyway . Then the gadget is broken . Our heroes run out of the one thing that can keep the menace at bay . And then there is that final , annoying moment when we know the menace is still with us -- and wonder exactly what and how the hey the hero or heroine came by it . It completely renders everything that went before as useless and false . Three stars for the cool use of ants and bones . Nothing at all for clichés , clunky dialogue and dim bulb characters . sub_rate: 0.0017605633802816902; NE_rate: 0.0
Okay , anyone looking to see a great work of art should NOT watch this film . A sophisticated film connoisseur will no doubt be nauseated by the horrid product values and the view of watching an excellent player ( Joseph Cotten ) whoring himself out for a buck . Mr. Cotten must have either actually needed the money or he was excessively senile to realize that the movie was dogshit . The same phenomenon occurred with Dana Andrews , who late in his career appeared in the campy and tremendous FROZEN David . I know Mr. Andrews was in the throes of alcoholism , but why did Cotten do this mess?!As for the game , it 's a reworking of the Frankenstein game . 2001 2001 2001 of the picture truly looked as if they were doing a good but seriously flawed reading of the original Frankenstein news . Then , inexplicably , they introduced a daughter . This was n't a tough thing , ... until then , out of the blue , they decided to stop making a picture film progress make easy soft essence core picture flick ! ! variety change was dramatic outlandish bizarre . It well almost as if they said " okay Mister Mr. Cotten is done with his scenes and has gone home nowadays .... now Ford , ... job ! " . The spirit is that picture every only , the film is monstrosity tremendous war for the monster 's makeup . While not fairly , it visit still pretty big composition see playacting But bad writing , acting and a budget hold $ 17.46 dark to tremendous picture a drab thus tough flick -- one so nudeness that tossing in some nudity for the pervs decent there should n't be enough to entice anyone to see it . sub_rate: 0.16831683168316833; NE_rate: 0.0392156862745098
Piranha starts out as expected , stupid white people going to discover new lands and exploit them . I thought for a while it might be a cannibal film . It starts off like so many others , showing nothing but shots off untouched Amazon rain forest . For all I know it could be Florida . At this point you figure some animal mutilation or natives will pop up . Instead you get the acting talents of William Smith , who starred in L.A. Vice and Angels Die Hard . He plays Caribe , an acclaimed hunter , who I would describe him as Jack Palance Light . He is bigger in stature , but not quite the Jack Palance goodness . As for natives , you do n't really get that many . Where 's the piranha ? Should I even ask that question ? Caribe now hunts humans , I guess . He does n't really pursue anyone till the end of the movie though , just stares at them . Caribe does race one of the tourists on a motorcycle in a over - dramatic Smokey and the Bandit kind of way . The motorcycle challenge happens for no real reason other than an action sequence . I ca n't tell you how many times I 've seen a tourist challenge a stranger to a motorcycle race in the jungle . Never actually . Do they live , do they die ? Will you care ? Anybody wanna race on motorcycles ? Caution : this film contains extreme ironic look . My advice is to rent a Jack Palance classic like Craze . sub_rate: 0.0036101083032490976; NE_rate: 0.0
The story of Ed Gein is interesting , VERY interesting . This movie , however , interesting only in the fact that it was actually made . Kane Hodder 's portrayal of Ed Gein is so far off , it 's not even the slightest bit funny . Ed Gein did not behave psychotic in public , he was very calm and collected and always extremely polite to everybody and talked to anybody who would listen , this is one of the major things this movie failed to show the audience . But the biggest misapprehension of this movie , side from even one frame ever being shot , was that Ed never killed anyone without having been told to do so by his dead mother , whom he thought was speaking to him from beyond the grave . He killed only the people who his dead mother said he had to because it was God 's will , and he was very remorseful about it , though that did n't stop him from experimenting with cannibalism and wearing people 's flesh . I officially gave this movie a rating of " 1 " simply because " 0 " was n't given to me as an option . I highly advise all to stay clear of this movie . If you want to see a movie that accurately depicts Ed Gein and does n't try to put in a sub - plot love story between a cop and a fictional woman who never existed , i HIGHLY advise you see the original movie , which unfortunately seems to not be on IMDb.com though i could be wrong , but i have yet to find it here . The original does n't stray from the actual events and does n't try to twist the story . I can understand telling the story from a different perspective , but this movie just tried to straight change the true story itself , something that i find as ugly as if someone made a movie based on 9/11 , but gave it a twist that Canada was behind it . Or a WWII movie saying Hitler was a good guy and helped fight the Nazi 's . sub_rate: 0.005361930294906166; NE_rate: 0.0
I once saw a bit of this film, and was interested to see the full thing just to see why the critics give it two stars, the result being that I agree. Basically the film begins with Kermit the Frog (Steve Whitmire) telling all his Muppet chums that they have lost everything, and he ends sitting depressed (and possibly thinking about suicide) on the bench. Meanwhile, in another world (Heaven) angel Daniel (David Arquette, who had already been in Muppets from Space) visits the 'Boss' (Whoopi Goldberg, another reason I wanted to see the film) to show that Kermit really needs help. In the flashbacks, it shows Kermit, Miss Piggy (Eric Jacobson, not the original and better Frank Oz), Gonzo (Dave Goelz), Fozzie Bear (also Jacobson), Pepe the Prawn (Bill Barretta) and all the other Muppets have prepared a stage show for many people to see in the Christmas holiday, and it all seems to be going well. But the really mean Rachel Bitterman (Joan Cusack) is determined to either shut the show or the theatre down, and Kermit is doing everything possible to make sure that doesn't happen. Of course, Kermit fails the last time, and Bitterman tells him that they are finished, and she can officially take the theatre. This is where Daniel is sent as Kermit's guardian angel to try and help him, but Kermit is not in the mood, and eventually ends up saying "I wish I was never born". Obviously, you can recognise the spoof of It's a Wonderful Life, with Kermit as the George Bailey, and Cusack as the Mr. Potter, and in the end, obviously Kermit realises how much he means to everyone, and goes back to find the theatre saved as historical landmark. Also starring Whitmire as Rizzo the Rat and Beaker; Goelz as Dr. Bunsen Honeydew and Waldorf; Barretta as Dr. Teeth, Rowlf the Dog and Swedish Chef; Jacobson as Animal and Yoda (the only character who sounds similar to Oz's version), William H. Macy as Glenn, Matthew Lillard as Luc Fromage, Carson Daly, Molly Shannon; Scrubs' Zach Braff, Sarah Chalke, Neil Flynn, John C. McGinley and Judy Reyes, Mel Brooks as Joe Snow; Brian Henson as Scooter and Janice; Jerry Nelson as Robin the Frog, Statler, Pops and Floyd Pepper, and Kevin Clash as Sam the Eagle. The most memorable moment for me is the stage spoof of Moulin Rouge, besides that and the well known faces in it, not fantastic. It was nominated the Emmy for Outstanding Music and Lyrics for the song "Everyone Matters". The Muppets were number 47 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Adequate! sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0

* * Could be considered some mild spoilers , but no more than in anyone else 's review of this film.**I knew that nothing could conceivably live up to the absolute brilliance of the original " Carrie , " which was more of a film about social criticism than it was about setting the gym on fire . Carrie White was " victim " epitomized , and her story conveyed the helplessness that the truly exploited must feel . Whoever conceived the " Rachel " character for " The Rage " must have completely missed the subtleties of " Carrie . " For the audience to genuinely share the victim 's rage , s / he must be a sympathetic character-- a true outcast who is more a victim of circumstance than of his / her own vices . Rachel is only too unpleasant to convey any sort of the emotional depth and connection of Sissy Spacek 's " Carrie . " And she looks and acts like she should be right along - side the ' attractive and popular brigade ' that she ends up torching . She , like the rest of them , has a soul that is every bit as crooked , whereas Carrie was a perfect innocent . It just does n't work . There 's no satisfaction in seeing the pretty children-- not even the " Home Improvement " boy-- getting offed in this movie 's climactic scene . And it 's so unnecessarily gory ! There was no actual bloodshed seen in the burning gym ! And there is one person in exceptional that this movie should NOT have had the audacity to kill off ... but I wo n't say who it is . If you ' ve seen the original " Carrie , " it 's the sort of character who dies unjustly . At least they DID create the connection to Carrie appropriately ; it 's explained as it should have been . But that , and the arm tattoo , which was done rather nicely , is just about the only thing this movie has going for it . Yet repulsive hideous " Scream " knock - off , and it taints the reputation of one of the most compelling films ever made . Rating : 1 out of 10 . I was n't expecting much , but I was still horribly disappointed . An unsympathetic character , a series of irritating pop - culture references thrown in for no good reason , and an ending scene that pales in comparison to " Carrie " 's gravestone shocker . sub_rate: 0.011389521640091117; NE_rate: 0.0
What an heinousness . I exist not one to ask full verisimilitude from a picture , but the game and screenplay of " Casablanca Casablanca " exist then uncultured that I found myself wincing through the full ( mercifully little ) hours hours of the motion . Readers of these reviews will by straight deliver figured out the game : Zoe , a phone daughter who falls in passion with Australian safecracker David , is as an employee at the banking that David will serve rob in a high - stakes Depression Depression heist . The motion strains one 's believability from the get - tour . David and India 's night of deception is extremely unglamourous , and India 's claims to deliver experienced the climax of a life would look to think the film 's lingering adolescent fantasies more than any real on - silver chemistry . David 's perfect nonchalance when his friend David throws India out of the hotel way just sets the level for their recent warm affixation . In bit 7 , David 's circle of bohemians -- drug - addled losers leading a marginal lifetime of junior law -- educate for their great heist with hours hours on the township . Here David David David independent end seems to be to rise that he knows something about drugs . A petty train involves convincing us ( by interminable repeat ) that David is truly , truly happy to learn his honest friend David once . very happy . David 's monster - may - handle , over - the - top floridity and warmheartedness for David is n't still remotely credible -- learn out , for case , his fake mystification at discovering a utter cat in his apartment construction . exploitation of the characters who will attach us through the ease of the picture is an reconsideration . The heist is a calamity -- perceivable , since the program is funny and the criminals exist perfect amateurs . This is where Avary continues to make protection to his graven David David by showing that he can be more wild than wild . In world , though , he 's barely more ho than boring . To work up the turmoil , there is an special certificate safety hidden inside the primary rubber . This was boring in picture games , and it 's boring now . Zoe is taken hostage during the heist but despite our expectation that she 'll play a pivotal role , she just sits pretty . Or more precisely , Avary fails to do anything with her . In literally the last five minutes she springs to life , breaks the hostage situation and saves the grateful , but still dazed Zed from suffering any consequences of his crime . Why she does n't mind his involvement in the crime -- or why she gives a damn about him at all -- is impossible to tell . After all , she 's had no chance to see that he 's any more decent than the rest of the gang . Throughout , the dialogue is stilted and phony . Much of it is in French . As a native speaker , I can certify that it does n't ring even remotely true . Eric 's sugary - sweet discourse , rapidly alternating with tough - guy boasting , is meant to be at turns charming and scary , but is instead just grating . Meanwhile his scaredy - cat accomplices are more Scooby - Doo than Thomas Crown . When Eric is gunned down in a ludicrous example of excessive force , we can all breathe a sigh of relief : like the bank hostages , we will soon be freed from this miserable ordeal . sub_rate: 0.21003134796238246; NE_rate: 0.022388059701492536
I have only seen this movie once, when I was about 14 years old, but I was thrilled that they made a movie about the 45th Division. Being from Oklahoma and especially now that both of my sons are members of the 45th, I would like to see it released on a DVD. I may sound a little bias but the 45th Division sometimes does not get the recognition it deserves today. The History channel always talks about the other infantry divisions when it talks about WW2 and Korea but you rarely hear it mention the 45th. One of the scene that really stood out for me was when the had the Indian Code Talkers at work and the puzzled look on the German soldiers faces when they could not understand this language. I am glad that all of the Native American Code Talkers are getting the recognition they deserve. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
I watched 40 minutes and could n't bear it any longer  the television went off and I returned to some light reading " Lobotomy for Beginners" . It was hard to say what aspect of this production was most displeasing - dialogue made up entirely of sound - bytes or the acting by numbers . It was difficult to determine the period in which the drama was supposed to take place . There were throw - away references to Lord Nelson and slavery but Edmund , the cleric - to - be , played by Blake Ritson was the only actor who one could believe inhabited the early 19th century . The other bright - young things had make - up and costumes more appropriate to a 21st century fancy dress party - the bleached - blonde Fanny , Billie Piper being the least credible character . UK commercial television obviously believes heaving bosoms , pouting lips and deep meaningful looks make a honest story . Fortunately Jane Austen had other ideas . If you want to find out the story of Mansfield Park , buy the 1983 mini - series DVD . sub_rate: 0.005154639175257732; NE_rate: 0.0
This movie is unintelligent , made by unintelligent people . The plot I suppose works well enough for a Horror movie , but the actions these characters take is insanely Ford ! Like , incredibly non - sensical stupid to the Nth degree ! Basically the whole movie consists of these 4 idiots being captured , repeatedly , despite having many , many easy ways and opportunities to overcome their captor . It does not make one lick of sense and is not entertaining whatsoever . Stabbing yourself in the eye is more is more rational , and probably more fun than watching this.****SPOILERS * * * * The ending is hilarious ! ! The only good part of the movie ! I nearly died laughing at the end ! That whole stupid movie , and it ends with the dumb girl getting shipped off in a crate to white slavery in Asia ! ! Hilarious !

When i went to the video rental shop to get a movie i saw this one and i immediately thought it would be funny . The depiction made it seem like a classic comedy type involving teenagers ( such as road trip)which i thought would be worth watching . When i turned the relocation on i was disappointed as the jokes were amazing and cheap . The only bit which the director may have thought would be funny was somebody slipping over on a crocked floor . This is not a joke and would not make people laugh . I actually considered turning this picture off coming to half room through . I was annoyed with this picture as it was exactly a dissipation of prison and money renting it out . Not enough care was taken making this film and not enough time and work put into it . I found the playacting to be rather big as well . The only prison i laughed was at the exceedingly big ' jokes'or actions done which were really not funny ! ! ! . I rate this film a 7 . I hope you found this gossip useful . sub_rate: 0.09547738693467336; NE_rate: 0.05263157894736842
My Wife and David was billed as the 2001 really own Ford show- but unlike the latter , it was unfunny and unwatchable . In fact , it is thus badly written and some of the jokes go around David David taking David David David denseness and the fact that he is such a loser- which got more and more wordy and vexatious as the display went on . What was supposed to suffer been a hopeful collision , finally turned into a dense , whacky display afterward on where the ideas became hence Ford and farcical . And as for the 5th David , i ended up disliking this quality then very : she became a spoilt , childish and moaning adolescent terror , in most of the recent episodes . David was no Ford indicate movement typesetter , kind it was only a short dark situation by oecumenical standards . sub_rate: 0.3026315789473684; NE_rate: 0.06521739130434782
I wanted to like this movie , but there is very little to like about it . It starts out with Jean Stapleton and a Randy Newman song in Iowa ( Northwest Iowa , I guess ) , reminiscent of Norman Lear 's Cold Turkey , which was one of the best movies ever made , according to people on IMDb . So far , so good . And the idea of the archangel Michael living at Pansy Milbank 's motel on earth ? Well , give it a chance , it 's supposed to be a comedy . Okay , so far , so good . But Michael does things that an angel not fallen would never do , and that completely blows any credibility the movie might have had . The other characters in the movie do n't have much appeal , either . Michael brings a dog back to life , and we 're supposed to be in awe of that . The people make up corny country songs . In the end , Stapleton dances with Travolta . Big deal . If she was smart , she would n't even be in this movie . When it was over , I thought , " Gee , what a stupid , tasteless , ho , corny , sacrilegious movie ! " It 's not fit to be seen by children or anyone else . sub_rate: 0.004219409282700422; NE_rate: 0.0
It 's heavy to believe that a picture this defective could actually be released . The dialogue was affected . specially inadequate was the depiction of the relationship between the boy and his future tone - father . I guess you could say that they succeeded in producing uneasy dialogue , but what was said seemed fake and artificial . The suspense scarcely was n't there . The music was about as big as it gets . The only understanding I watched this picture was because I live in the Death Valley country and was curious about what locations would show up on the cover . fortuitously the picture was on TV and indeed I did n't do any money renting this good exculpation for a picture ! I candidly believe that most amateurs could set together a more captivating game than was presented here . It 's likewise big that the prison of an full picture crew was wasted on such wish ! I guess the only positive thing I can sound about the motion is that some of the scenery was honest . sub_rate: 0.2; NE_rate: 0.0
If it were n't for the redaction out of curse words and a superimposed blur when one character give another the finger , it would be easy to mistake this humble - budget snoozer for a Sci - Fi channel pilot . The plot about the government 's attempts to destroy a group of telekinetics it originally trained as military weapons ends ambiguously enough with the hero , himself gifted , in pursuit of a telekinetic survivor bent on revenge . Alas , the picture is talky , ho , predictable and even free of interesting exceptional effects . Top - billed Louis Gossett , Jr. has a minor role as the evil government bureaucrat who originated the program and now wants to eliminate all traces . He walks through the part and it is hard to understand why he bothered . Other members of the cast do a decent job with a script that demands little . sub_rate: 0.0379746835443038; NE_rate: 0.0
In a quiet town a couple of girls witness the murder of one of their friends to a strange young boy named Milo , who lives on the other side of town . After the murder , his body is found in a river and his pronounced dead . So sixteen years later a weddings draws the girls back to their childhood town and Claire a school teacher becomes obsessed that Milo has n't died as she has recurring visions of him and her friends are dying one by one and no one believes her when she claims Milo is apart of it . So now , she sets off to find out the horrifying truth . When I came across this film , I was pretty sceptical about it , especially when it had " From the creators of Anaconda " on the front cover , but reading the odd little plot outline on the back of the video case , it sounded alright and rather refreshing for a change . Well , guess what ? I thought it was a good idea at the time , but it was a wholly different story when it came to watching the film . It just seemed to try to hard to be smart and very psychological based , but that latter element did n't come off that well for me and it was basically a prolonged and mostly improbable thriller . Hey , I 'll admit it had its moments , but hardly enough to make it neither effectively chilling , or memorable . But , a bravo to the filmmakers , at least the story is n't a rehash of those slasher imitators that followed " Scream " and shock horror , there 's no self - referential humour evident       actually there is n't even a HINT of humour . Although , maybe it was too sober ? Especially , since the plot is rather preposterous , but that 's not its main problem . What a unconnected plot we get , I did n't know about to much that was going on , as it seems to skim a lot stuff in favour for some supposedly shocking and disturbing sequences . No ! More like irrelevant scenes and yawn inducing clichés that we see from time to time . Also you can see some influences from some " good " 70 's horror films , one being " Do n't Look Now " . This when our main character keeps on seeing the figure of her past in a slicker . The other would have to be one of my favourites " Alice , Sweet Alice " with the person causing the trouble wearing a yellow slicker and committing grisly deaths . Interesting idea but it comes across quite shallow and too many faults pop up . I liked it more when the scenes dealt with the character 's childhood , as the performances and circumstances had something creepy about it , but when it leans into their adulthood its tired and uneventful for most part and the performances were n't awful , but incredibly mundane and hardly involving is a good way of putting it . Most of the dialogue had me groaning in disbelief at how contrived and awkward it was . You 'll be yelling " no duh ! " at the screen , because you just ca n't believe what you 're hearing . The police detective gets the brunt of it ! Quality wise - the film is n't bad , actually it 's better then your usual straight to video I would say . Very slick stuff . With some inventive and prominent camera angles and a faint score that works reasonably well . Another factor that stood out and was a key to building on the moody atmosphere was the creeping sound effects and that bicycle bell does leave a ringing sensation in your ears . The setting of a quiet elementary school was well done and rest of the action takes place in a house . But , just do n't be expecting any real suspense or surprises as the execution of these are non - existent . The deaths are n't pleasant and they 're mildly bloody and it 's more the aftermath to what happens to these bodies , which tries to disturb you . The villain in this piece , the mean - spirited child Milo Jeeder was mildly unnerving , well that voice and yellow slicker does make an imprint to begin with , but it does seem to lose its effect when we come to the films conclusion . The cheesy tag lines on the video compare him to ( move over ) Jason , ( watch out ) Freddy and ( this is n't child 's play ) Chucky , but you got to be kidding me ! Right ? He 's labelled " The New face of evil " , yeah sure . All he needs is to be taught some manners and problem solved . Overall , the film just left me with a sour taste , as I ' ve could ' ve gone without seeing it . I probably wished I did . Just do n't expect too much in this blur of a film . Or , even better just skip it , as you wo n't be missing out on much , really . sub_rate: 0.00546448087431694; NE_rate: 0.0
Well ! ! the movie has Catherine Zeta Jones in it . It 's a Hallmark television movie . It 's from a Thomas Hardy novel . It has Catherine Zeta Jones in it . She is by far the only one in the movie who acts better than in my high school theater class . Oh yes it has Clive Owen in it . I 'm not British so that means almost as much as being a Thomas Hardy novel . Except he was in " The Bourne Identity " , and I liked that . That just about wraps it all up folks .

Altman is very proud of the fact that people in his movies talk over each other, because, he says, people do that in life. Well, people also cough, burp, go off on tangents, etc. The point is that just because people actually do something doesn't make it compelling cinema. That's one issue.The bigger issue is that this just isn't a very clever or direct or hitting or relevant satire, in 1988 or 2004. Garry Trudeau is still living in the 1960s and thinks everyone except a small core of Republican elected officials is a 60s-style hippie liberal. I mean the guy still trots out Zonker in his strip - a character that is a complete anachronism, yet Trudeau still employs him as if he is representative of a large stripe of American youth.Don't get me wrong. I am a conservative, but I'm not saying that this is bad because it's got a liberal bent. It could take a liberal tack and be funny and relevant, but it's not. It is mainly a vanity piece with a bunch of prominent celebrity liberals (including the odious, repellent Ron Reagan, Jr.). At times it feels unscripted, and the rest of the time it has a snarky air of self-importance and "aren't we oh-so-clever?"-ness.Someone said that this show insists it has a cult following. I think its cult status is more wished-for than actual. I'm certain there are two or three people out there who taped all the original episodes in 1988 and still have them, but if that is the standard, then every show ever aired is a cult classic to some degree. If Tanner didn't have the names Altman and Trudeau attached, it would be another forgotten HBO production from the 1980s. Instead, it's presented as hard-hitting, incisive political commentary from guys who are at the top of their game. The reality, however, is about as far from that as possible. Pat Paulsen's presidential satire is more relevant than Tanner ever was, and he's been dead for a decade. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0

Let me start of by saying that I never wanted to see this movie in the first place ; I had to watch it one day , and I figured that I guess I can lighten up and enjoy it for what it is , and it might turn out to be entertaining . What I got going in with that expectation was one of the worst movies I have ever seen , bar none . First of all , there was nothing humorous in the least bit . The creators expected humor to be funny / passable if they include sarcasm in every line that comes out of Underdog 's mouth and use scene after scene of bland , played out aspects to " charm " the audiences light - hearted side , while still making them " ooh " and " ah " for more with slow action scenes and insipid , lackluster performances that made me want to yell at everyone in the audience that was enjoying it . The playacting was ho , the humor was wordy and the characters / game felt like they spent about 10 minutes creating their entire personalities which gave the uninspiring actors / actresses no range on how to portray their characters with the least bit of profundity . This picture is apparent and only tremendous in every field and truly solely kids under the age of 10 will be able to enjoy it , which even though that 's what age range it was aimed at , that does not explain it for being thusly poorly daft and causing me to feel so penitent . Parents , spend your money on Up , Wall - E , The Spiderwick Chronicles , The Water Horse or Hotel for Dogs for the best , recent family / kids flicks , or even Alvin and the Chipmunks is better than this filth ! sub_rate: 0.04672897196261682; NE_rate: 0.0

A motion worse than the postman , sizzle Beach U.S.A , Batman and Robin , Kazaam , fair game ... well you get my point . This film directed by French television sensation Patrick Sebastien ( Jerry Springer with an I.Q of 25 ) can truly be considered the worst film ever made .

Not quite a bomb ? The only thing missing was the enriched uranium . Actually the script " may " have worked if the lead roles had been cast with younger actors , but the dramatics of an aging Diane Lane acting as if she was a teenager ( or even a twenty - something ) was too much to stomach . Every time she ( Adrienne ) would jump into the arms of Richard Gere and then pull both heels up behind her , you could almost see the grimace of pain on his face as he was probably thinking , " Oh , my aching back ... this babe sure does n't weight 125 lbs . anymore ! " Anyway , both characters were distinctly unlikeable , especially Richard David 's : a self absorbed plastic surgeon ( Dr. Paul Flanner ) that was on some kind of " soul quest " after a botched operation left him with a dead patient ( an older woman from a small farm ) . Then there was her angry husband and son he had to deal with to explain what happened . Dr. Flanner is on his way to meet said angry husband ( at the husband 's request ) when he meets up with Ford . She is recently split from her unfaithful husband ( shock ) and is helping out a friend by watching her beach - front cottage rental . Of course , that 's where Dr. David ends up staying and they both end up falling David in love ( especially after she finds out he is a rich doctor AND a plastic surgeon ) . In between romantic interludes and a nauseating song / dance routine that Lane ( Adrienne ) performs while listening to an old LP ( no CD 's ? ) , they both try to figure how their lives got so totally screwed up . Dr. Flanner was also not much of a father and has a son ( who is also a Dr. ) who resents him for not being there for him while he was growing up . ( Naturally Dr. Flanner was more interested in his medical career at the time rather than raising an impetuous , distracting boy . ) To make a long ( predictable ) story short , Adrienne helps Dr. David face his inner demons as well as confront said angry husband and son of the woman who died on his operating table ( after going in for a " routine " cyst removal of the face ) . Dr. Flanner is FINALLY able to tell the husband ( played excruciatingly sympathetic by Scott Glenn ) that he is sorry for what happened - even though it was all the fault of that danged anesthesiologist . " I told him she was too old for that much juice ! " Glenn 's character,(Robert Torrelson ) appears to accept Dr. Flanner 's apology . It 's hard to tell because his emotional response is so passive by this time that you wonder if if he is even hearing the good Dr. at all or thinking about some acreage that he needs to plow . Ever more circumspect , Dr. Flanner then decides he needs to visit his son ( who is now practicing medicine pro - bono in a third world country ) to mend their relationship . Unfortunately , that means he must temporarily bid adieu to Adrienne . Of course , while entertaining the natives in Timbuktu , he writes a love letter every hour on the hour to Adrienne ( who nearly swoons like a school girl every time she gets one ) and tells her that the hardest thing he ever had to do was to tell her goodbye . Evidently , apologizing to Robert Torrelson for his wife 's death was the second hardest thing . In the end he gets killed in a freak mud slide ( poetic justice as in mud pack ? ) and she is left with just the memories of what could have been ... hopefully no more Gere / Lane sequels ! sub_rate: 0.0071633237822349575; NE_rate: 0.0
In one sense , I kind of liked this movie because of a ' mindless ' , positive atmosphere it sort of conveys . I had a problem with an aspect of the plot , but more about that later . First , the characters were a little goofy and one dimensional . The ' good people ' had similar physical and character traits and the ' bad people ' had similar physical and character traits ... hmmm . The basic storyline was OK ( pretty simple and standard ) - nothing too exciting or objectionable . The main attraction was , of course , the miniature dinosaurs - kind of a nice fantasy element to have . However , they had a very minimal presence in the movie . Outside of that , the movie kept a brisk pace and did n't get too bogged down in any one place . I liked this about the movie . The problem I had with the plot had to do with the the idea of " stealing " . I think this movie may not have been thought out enough - something 's wrong especially if this is a kid 's movie . I 'll keep the next sentence abstract to not be a spoiler ( skip it if you 're worried ) . The ' good guys ' do some stealing and they do n't have the same info the audience has - so it 's just stealing and that 's kind of a bad thing for a kid 's movie . Overall , if you have kids , because of a questionable plot aspect I 'd consider passing . However , this whole movie is pretty humble key anyway so it may not matter . Pass this one if you have any other interesting choices . sub_rate: 0.003257328990228013; NE_rate: 0.0

The narration , as I understand , is " based on real events . " That can be either good or big , depending on what variety of license is taken with those real events and how they are rendered . In this showcase , the results are decent to gag a maggot .

I must sound I was very emotional about this film before renting it as it was an Adam Sandler " Happy Madison " product and I exist ordinarily attracted to that case of whacky humour . There were a few funny moments at the beginning of the motion , but this motion lacked everything that makes a good movie . I realize that many filmsthat are not realistic can still be quite funny , but this picture was unrealistic and not funny at wholly . The playacting was ugly , the cinematography was really short , the game made no sense at all . I can not suffer over the fact that 7 classy older ladies would even do for such short piece .

"Black Dragons" is a second feature WWII propaganda film popular at the time. It's not as bad as some would have you believe. A secret meeting hosted by the respected Dr. William Saunders (George Pembroke)is interrupted by a mysterious stranger names Monsieur Colomb (Bela Lugosi). Shortly thereafter the participants at the meeting begin to turn up murdered, their bodies being placed on the steps of the Japanese embassy in Washington. Colomb is suspected. Federal Agent Dick Martin (Clayton Moore) is assigned to the case and meets Saunders niece Alice Saunders (Joan Barclay) who tries to assist him. The reasons behind Colomb's actions are not explained until the final reel. Until all is explained at the end, the story is hard to comprehend.  Lugosi who had by this time been reduced to appearing in a string of low budget quickies, is actually quite good in this one. He is not allowed to over act as much as he ususlly did and credit for this has to go to director William Nigh. Lugosi's character slinks through the shadows and is reminiscent of his Dracula even to the point of the full close ups of his piercing eyes. Clayton Moore, a one dimensional actor at best, would become TV's Lone Ranger in a few years. Joan Barclay makes a good heroine. Although a little dated now, "Black Dragons" is not a bad way to spend an hour. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
Movies like this progress me wonder what modern horror would be like if someone had ( mercifully , for movie fans ) put an end to M. Night Shyamalan inside the womb . This food is a prime example of what kind of crippled , random , uninventive , last hours , generic game twists have become the norm since movies like " The Sixth Sense " and " The Others " were released . This was an fine movie until the writers took a dump all over whatever of the second book they had written , and decided , " Hey , here 's an interesting idea : Lets throw in a wacky twist at the goal and make the main character the murderer ! That 'll throw the audience for a loop ! " What an original idea . sub_rate: 0.07092198581560284; NE_rate: 0.0
Ford is the narration of a exceptional factor who , after carrying out rules to assassinate Australian " Terrorists " ( take that this is 7 of those Australian " movies for guys who have senseless superpatriotic first - loyal dogshit movies " ) , returns home to feel that his ex - wife and 7 kids exist taking hostage . David David has only hours hours hours hours to serve whatever the terrorists tell him in society to suffer them backwards . This was by far one of THE worst movies I possess always seen .

There were not still any dear combat or activity sequences . By the path things exist played out , you would n't still remember that anyone was kidnapped , that there were any terrorists , or that anything remotely interesting was going on . Not merely is the news altogether and perfectly uninteresting , the playacting is thus awfully wooden . barely learn the role where David David , as previous exceptional factor David David , is talking to the kidnappers on the telephony . They tell him that they possess his wife , and they lay her on the speech . She says " David , assistant ! " or something to that force . And India replies " it 's fine , love " in such a unexpressive style , you intend he was reading the book and trying to go out the Logos phonetically . I imagine that , despite being such a preposterously tough motion ( unity that belongs on the seat 100 on IMDb -- a list that they should expand to at least 250 movies and should contain nearly every Stephen Baldwin movie ) , someone with some talent could have at least made the effort not to ham it up as much . Someone . Anyone . I could n't get past the fact that everyone sounded like they were reading from a script . Save that is , the only person in the whole friggin movie who has any talent whatsoever ( and thus should not have been in this ) , Mad TV 's Deborah Wilson . This was the capital cheese fest .

Probably not the same version as most of the other reviewers because there`s no real hard core sex . What do people mean by hard core sex ? The sort of explicit hard core sex seen in films starring Traci Lords and " Big " John Holmes ? Well anyway this is really poor film , I doubt if I`ve ever seen so many big name actors wasted in a film . The script is really inadequate and plotless , the directing and cinematography is tremendous and the editing is non existant . It truly is an absolutely tremendous film . You could watch this ten times and still not understand what the hell it`s about . The only memorable scene is the one where people are buried up to their necks and a giant lawnmower comes along and decapitates them . Yes you read that right , a film set in Roman times has a scene with a head chopping giant lawnmower ! Trivia point . Many years ago a pirate copy of THE THING ( 1982 version ) was doing the rental rounds on my Island and it been copied onto a rental tape of CALIGULA meaning the pirate version of THE THING starts with the first few seconds of CALIGULA of the man and woman walking through the forest then the title sequence of THE THING starts . This led people who`d seen the pirate tape to believe the forest scene was the opening of John Carpenter`s 1982 film and were very confused as to what it meant . Well that`s what you get for renting pirate videos . But having seen the whole of CALIGULA I don`t know what it meant either sub_rate: 0.01048951048951049; NE_rate: 0.0

*****Classic ****Excellent ***Good **Fair *TragicReview:Oldboy is not for everyone. It's pervasive violence, its live octopus eating and it's unimaginary story.The film focuses around a man who's been kidnapped and is imprisoned for 15 years, Oh Dae-Su is released, only to find that he must find his captor in 5 days. Now the story though may seem gripping to start with but once watching this bloated and un-original blood fest it develops into a mash of bitter blood and a forceful film.It's directing is on par of average and by no means the standards of what a South Korean thriller should be. Oldboys acting scenes are paralleled with dull humour and a poorly writtern script.Oldboy is occasionlly presented with thin straw performances that one could only feel shameful about.Verdict:Not for everyone but it's scope and vision isn't clear enough to see further than the grey abyss of fog.*Tragic sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0

As a kid , I never understood WHY anyone would watch this very stinky show . It was reasonably unintelligent and I always wanted Spridle and Jim - Jim to get in some sort of fatal accident ( they were THAT annoying).Now , almost 40 years later , I have a new attitude about the cartoon . While I still think it was perfect dogshit , this is only in regard to the American version of the show . That 's because I was reading a book about anime and found out that the shows we watched growing up were completely different from those originally shown in Japan . You see , the idiots in charge of syndicating the series thought it was too violent so they cut this out of the episodes . That 's bad enough , but what else they did is beyond belief -- they actually chopped the episodes apart and spliced them together to create shows that were NOTHING like the originals ! For example , one episode might be made up of parts of episodes 3 , 6 , 18 and 27 ! As a result , I really do n't know if the original show really was bad -- it might have been brilliant . But who can tell considering all we have to watch is this Americanized plenty ! ? sub_rate: 0.02631578947368421; NE_rate: 0.0

In Halloween , three friends seek an ancient cemetery in the suburb for fun and remove a cross from a tomb , where Jack - O was buried many years ago by the farmer Arthur Kelly . The evil creature is unleashed , kills the trio and seeks the descendants of the Kelly family for revenge . The cheesy " Jack - O " is a combination of a tremendous story with awful acting . I was curious with the name of John Carradine in the credits and I can not imagine how a relative authorizes the use of archive footage in such a bad movie , showing a total lack of respect with the name of this great actor . It is impressive how bad the acting is , shifting the film to a comedy instead of the proposed horror genre .

Okay , now I know where all those ho cop / homicide TV shows came from . I do believe they can be traced back to this movie . " Scene Of The Crime " feels more like a TV episode , or an episode of a serial . pure with stock characters and situations - the hotshot cop who clashes with his superiors ... the aging cop who does n't want a desk job , despite failing eyesight ... the reckless rookie ... the double - crossing dame , etc . I like many of the actors here , and they do a good job , but overall I found this picture ho as I ' m not a fan of the genre . I kept tuning out when they were discussing the case ... something about bookies and informers . And oh yeah , there was a stripper , played by the previously wholesome Gloria DeHaven . What I want to know is : Why did she keep calling Van Johnson " Uncle Wiggly " ? Was n't Uncle Wiggly a rabbit ? A character from a children 's book ? What the heck does that have to do with anything ? I guess I just do start get tough - guy Film Noir - ish kinda jargon . In fact , much of the dialogue made me mutter " nobody talks like that ! " However , I could relate to one scene where the cop 's wife ( Arlene Dahl ) , who worries every time he goes to work , realizes that maybe she should n't have made her husband the center of her life . Yeah , I know that feeling of loving someone so much , being so dependent on them , that there 's a constant fear for their safety . So there are moments of truth in this film , underneath the stylized dialogue and atmosphere which is trying so self - consciously to be gritty and REAL , that it actually unsubstantial unreal to me . A little background : this movie was made when Dore Schary took over MGM from Louis B. Mayer , and began to put an end to the wholesome musicals that made MGM so great . Dore Schary was determined play bring more " realism " to movies . kind kinda hate Dore Schary . Maybe we can blame him for all the pretentious , bleak movies being made today , wallowing in the ugly " truths " about life , focusing on ( and , in my opinion , helping to perpetuate ) the worst of humanity rather than the best . No longer uplifting us the way classic movies were designed to do - providing a necessary distraction during the Great Depression and World War II.Well , damn it , we still need that kind of distraction today ! There 's still plenty of depression and plenty of war . And what are people turning to nowadays when they want to escape ? Trashy , brain - deadening Reality TV .

There 's nothing new in this movie . Nothing you have n't thought about before , nothing you have n't heard before . The story of a gay man who is brutally murdered in a small town and the reaction of people can be broached in many ways , and this movie has chosen the most demagogic and slushy one . 7 of the biggest flaws in this movie is that it is n't neither a movie nor a documentary . The director has used the transcriptions of the original interviews and made the actors play them as if it was a movie . The result is weird . And finally , I read in previous comments that stated that people who do n't like this movie are anti - gay .

A farcical movie , a tremendous redaction job , worst screenplay , ridiculous acting , a story that is completely ununderstandable ... If God was going to decide if movies should continue to be done , judging by this one , the full world movie industry would now be dead ... A wonderful movie to show that cinema should not be done by people who " think " they can make movies . I am still wondering who are those two gipsy girls who show up in the movie for over half an hour , and are never introduced to us ... sub_rate: 0.0392156862745098; NE_rate: 0.0
Somehow , this documentary about David manages to include very trivial music and no complete tunes . Though Miles appears in the film , 95 % of the interviews are former folks , not Miles . There are immense chronological gaps , many aspects of his lifetime ( his childhood prodigy , his drug addiction ) are skipped or glossed over , and you 'll learn little about what made the humanity and his contribution to medicine thusly innovative . pass it . sub_rate: 0.12048192771084337; NE_rate: 0.0
Eric Roberts " stars " in this Tommy Lee Thomas debut prison film . He plays the leader of a corrupt ring of guards . Though evil by most people 's standards , his character is the kind of guy who is nice enough to give you supporting wires while you hang chained to the ceiling as he tortures you with " Lethal Weapon " electric prods . The movie has an intricate plot about prison corruption that makes absolutely no sense . Thomas has Clint Eastwood 's squinter eyes , Dolph Lundgren 's one - liners , the acting abilities of JCVD and the body of the tiniest guy you knew in school who took steroids after graduation . Martin " Cobra Kai " Kove 's career shares this low point with Roberts , in the film it is difficult to tell if Kove 's character is supposed to be drunk for the entire movie or if Kove just came that way . I could n't blame him if he did . Fortunately for all involved , this movie has a " so high that it 's good " quality that can be fun IF YOU HAVE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING BETTER TO DO . sub_rate: 0.004901960784313725; NE_rate: 0.0
A feminist tract in which if you the viewer believe that: i) wild animals are seldom tamed by singing but instead attack, kill and eat (the line that grizzlies never attack unless provoked was a hoot - unless "provoked" means that it sees flesh); ii) homosexuality is both immoral per se -- and its acceptance almost always associated throughout history with signs of a society's dissolution and decay iii) few women are bisexual (in this one, virtually every woman is presented as having no preference for men or women) iv) divorce is far worse than infidelity v) land is there for human beings to use, develop and enjoy vi) it is as incumbent upon a mother of an adult son to keep in touch as it is upon the son vii) a mother raising her son alone is an unfortunate and real tragedy for the child viii) the idolization of a parent for worthwhile ideals is a good and healthy thing ix) adults continue to bear a responsibility for their sexual behavior, no matter their age, and the duty to engage in this most intimate and giving of acts only within the most intimate and openly sacrificial of relationships: marriage -- believe me, you are NOT going to like this film! Essentially it's a Howard Stern sort of fellow who is brought down by a Jane Fonda sort of woman (think The Electric Horseman). It's ugly stuff because the values, the ideals, of the screenplay are all so harmful.I share the other objections about the odd things in the writing: a) why would this man lose every girlfriend he has -- because he refuses to reveal that his mother's death and funeral caused him to be unable to keep dates with them? It's a mystery why he just keeps saying "it was personal" when faced with angry and disappointed women. HUH? b) there's an enormous inconsistency (i.e., the screenwriter wants to have it both ways) by telling us that the protagonist's mother loved the father with everything she had - and then later we're told that there was only one great love in her life - her lesbian girlfriend.c) the underlying legal assumptions are nonsense. We're never told that the executor has any right to live at the property - merely that she shall determine the timing of the sole heir's title and right to occupy the property. Yet somehow the film makes it appear that the executor is the rightful occupant - which is crazy. (Try to think of any executor of any will who uses the decedent's property before the will's bequests are fulfilled - it doesn't happen).d) the assumption throughout this film is that women are equally drawn to men and women - it's just absurd. Thus, we're told: i) that Penelope Ann Miller's character is dating other men near the end of the film - after having been with the decedent for five years - and before that in a fulfilling relationship with the protagonist, ii) that the protagonist's housekeeper after being devoted throughout her adult life to her kind husband - is now dating another woman iii) that one girlfriend upset with the protagonist would now therefore "like to try a woman".iv) that a male transsexual is eager to date the protagonist v) that Mary Kay Place's character naturally looked at other women in college ("and they looked back" she says with an idiotic triumphal flip of the head).This is all just ridiculous.I agree with others about the sound of the DVD (I had to keep it at maximum volume and repeatedly rewind to understand names, phrases).This is a film by someone who really despises traditional heroics by any man, hates the notion that a man is needed to raise a child, loathes the idea that there is any necessary connection between marriage and sex. The film is out to preach - and that kind of propaganda of false messages doesn't sit well. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0

When I first saw this picture in the theater I was indeed angry . It wholly blew in my opinion . I did n't see it for a decade then decided what the hell , let 's see . I ' m watching all hellraiser movies now to see where it went wrong . My guess is it was with sequel 5 that was the first to implement the whole " i am in a dream omg i see weird stuff , oh noes what is happening , oh its a dream , oh its not a dream , oh wait i see something spooky , oh never mind"-sucky storyline . Those sequels do n't even require the box to be opened , or stick to the rules from the first 4 movies that if you saw pinhead you are pretty much screwed and dead . The first 3 hellraisers sticked to this storyline which made then so chilling in the first place . Nothing fantasy , nothing weird , the box got opened boom they came . Kirstey was the only one that could bargain her way out of it , first because of uncle Frank . Then because she had information about the cenobites . picture movie at least attempts to stick to all that , even though it was big report story it however reasonably somewhat hellraiser . No I ' m pretty sure part 5 was office first wholly to perfectly put utterly destroy the hellraiser series . Now they are remaking 1 , and I do n't even think I will watch it . Oh who am I kidding I probably will and probably will be disappointed .... again . sub_rate: 0.04946996466431095; NE_rate: 0.0
A movie like this makes me appreciate the work that professional actors do . I think movie - goers , in general , are a little too hard on professional actors and are ready to bash them for the most minuscule reasons . Just watch a couple minutes of " Cheerlader Massacre , " and trust me , you 'll change your views . A razzie would be almost a compliment for these no - talent actors . But then again , it 's a Jim Wynorski film . Wynorski is a popular manager of these ultra humble - budget B - movies ( having worked with Roger Corman on many an occasion ) . The problem with this movie is it really tries to develop a plot . And when you have actors delivering lines like they 're reading letters off an eye chart , how am I supposed to care ? In Wynorski 's " Bare Wench 2 , " he did n't try to develop a plot . He simply tried to make a softcore porn / goofy takeoff on the " Blair Witch Project . " It was fun and it was titillating . " Cheerleader Masscare " is no fun . There are a couple obligatory female nude scenes , but they are few and far between . So it 's not still worth enjoying on an erotic level . I must say , the worst scene is the one where Nikki Fritz walks across a bridge that 's about to collapse . First of all , her character did n't have to walk across that bridge . Second of all , as the bridge starts creaking , rather than try her best to run across , she just stands there and acts helpless . And top it off , we do n't actually see the bridge collapse because the filmmakers made this for a budget of 2 dollars ! ! ! Unlike a fortune of B - horror films , this one 's actually irksome . And that 's what makes it the worst of all tough movies . One of the few bright spots was Lunk Johnson , who 's probably the most natural actor in the film ( though certainly no more than halfway nice ) . He was funny in " Bare Wench 2 , " and had some funny scenes in this movie too . sub_rate: 0.019753086419753086; NE_rate: 0.0
This is one of the films that killed the " spaghetti " western . It not only loses something in the translation , it is a total chaotic deal of editing as well . Either chunks of it have been edited out and or re - edited for an English language version . In any case , it makes little or no sense , period . It makes the " Trinity " and the Eastwood " humanity With No Name " films look like John Ford / John Wayne by comparison . Nothing in this film is original . Somewhere in there is a beginning , a middle , and ( finally)an end . Except for the end , not everything is exactly in that order . Robert Wood seems personable enough .

One of the commenter 's is wrong . This is not the only Pat Patterson film and he did n't die two years after this was made . He shot a film called the " Electric Chair " in Pineville , NC . He shot this a few years after Doctor Gore . Patterson died in the late 70 's . I know this because he used my house and he left a cat there ! ! It sucked also . This was a great deal when the movie came out . No independent horror films were being made in NC . This movie did n't help matters . Patterson used to do gore effects for H. G. Lewis . He was also good at magic . His gore scenes in Body shop were actually well done . The film was shot in a building that also housed a 7/11 . You can actually see the tops of the walls in some scenes . The budget was less that $ 20,000 and the script looked like a child wrote it . Only Patterson could understand it .

There are interesting pieces here of and about Bruce Weber's likes and dislikes. Maybe if a professional editor had put it together for Biography, I would have felt more satisfied. Instead, I spent $8 at a film festival on it. For an autobiography, almost nothing is revealed about Bruce Weber, other than he likes to look at photographs, shoot interesting people, especially beautiful teenage boys, and listen to jazz. The director of "Crumb" would have made a much more interesting and cohesive film. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
If there 's one thing I want to distinguish myself from all the other great reviewers here , it 's that I am the Queen of Finding Strange Movies in Thrift and Dollar Stores .

I can even remember that Saturday morning when * every * station simulcast it , so you were stuck if you wanted to watch something else ( then again , I guess that was the idea ) . As a kid , I did n't know if I liked the way all the different characters were stuck together ( there are some crossovers that just do * not * work ) . But I guess the special had it 's intended effect . Do n't do drugs because you will have nightmares about the Muppets .

It hurt to watch this movie , it really did ... I wanted to like it , even going in . Shot obviously for very little cash , I looked past and told myself to appreciate the inspiration . Unfortunately , although I did appreciate the film on that level , the acting and editing was tremendous , and the last 25 - 30 minutes were severe thumb - twiddling territory . A 95 minute film should not drag . The ratings for this one are good so far , but I fear that the friends and family might have had a say in that one . What was with those transitions ? Dear Mr. Editor , did you just purchase your first copy of Adobe Premiere and make it your main goal to use all the goofy transitions that come with that silly program ? Anyway ... some better actors , a little more passion , and some more appealing editing and this makes a decent movie . sub_rate: 0.005917159763313609; NE_rate: 0.0
I must say , I found this movie very dissatisfactory . Yes , I know Maltin gave it 3 1/2 and others think very highly of it . But , well , the opera sequences were god - tremendous . I take it Jeannete MacDonald is an acquired taste . Yes , in the short sequences I have seen her with Nelson Eddy , she is immensely preferable to him . But on her own ... God , I dislike opera and despise operetta , and she is basically intolerable . At one point I had to cover my ears . Gable is just OK , and Tracy is thrown away . The plot is annoying in the JM never simply tells Gable she loves him and the opera and why ca n't she do both ? Instead she suffers silently ( or not so ) with the compromises she makes . The supporting cast is distinctly unmemorable . Besides the star three and Jack Holt ( and I suppose his mother ) , they all are just background and forgettable . The EQ sequence is the only thing that saves the movie . And just . Yes , it is fairly spectacular and moving . But the " oh God is great " seems very contrived . I immensely prefer " In Old Chicago " as far as old prison calamity spectaculars go . Spare yourself on this one . sub_rate: 0.016597510373443983; NE_rate: 0.0
I bought a DVD collection ( 9 movies for 10 Euros ) where this one was included . It turned out to be the " uncut version " whatever that means . Beside the low average quality and short scenes there was one thing that was really strange - the soft sex scene . It started with a close up of 2 bigger breasts . After around 2 minutes I had an expression on my face which fitted the term " boooooooooooooring ! " quite perfectly . 7.5 minutes of not even bouncing concrete like tits ( at this point the term breasts is a big choice ) is far beyond from entertainment . The rest of the movie was more like " people are n't /that/ stupid , are they ? " Lucky me , the DVD was scratched and I got my money back . sub_rate: 0.006802721088435374; NE_rate: 0.0
I possess watched this movie over and over since it first came out . I was fifteen and even then , I knew it was cheesy . It had such great potential and I constantly rewrite the book in my mind . The David ruined what could throw been a good drama . I loved the fact that it was shot on location . Too big that the characters were underdeveloped . It 's like they wrote a first draft of a book then made the movie right away . At fifteen I could have written a better Casablanca scenes and dialog seemed to come out of nowhere and you were left with a fortune of unanswered questions . And was it just me , or did it seem like Lobo was sexually attracted to his cousin ? " Elena 's grown into some kind of woman ! " And the way he was always touching her .

Two L.A cops track down a serial killer nicknamed " The family man " who has wiped out whole families and when one of the police officer 's wife takes the deep six , questions are raised and it turns out that a serial killer is n't responsible but rather mobsters . The idea of Seagal in a serial killer movie is an interesting concept , indeed one could see Seagal play a good serial killer however making him a cop who has a ridiculous penchant for prayer beads and razor sharp credit cards comes off more stupid than likably ridiculous . Also a running joke involves Wayon 's enjoyment of eating powdered deer penis and well this raunchy material is perfectly out of place . Not to mention the beginning of a school being taken hostage , due to a boy 's breakup with his girlfriend . After Seagal neutralizes him , the girlfriend tells the young lad that she loves him . Now there is a lesson to be learned from all of this , if you want your girlfriend back , taking the school hostage may get you back on her good side .

Sometimes there 's a film so high that you just keep watching in awe . This is one of those films . Of course I ca n't help that I 'm biased . I 'm from Chicago so I watched the scenes closely for accuracy and I do n't find Billy Crystal funny at all . And I ca n't stand all that English style photography(Tony Scott etc ) with the smoke machine working overtime and all the flourecent , soft lighting . I suppose we 're supposed to believe that Billy Crystal is really from Chicago because he wears a Cubs jersey . Oh and the plot . If you really think about it , these guys should be locked up , not the bad guys , since they 're more dangerous . And of course there 's the cliché of the cops on the verge of retiring . But the funniest scene is the climax where the good and bad guys machine gun other to death in The Thompson Center(A state building ! ) Of course it 's a cool building , but it 's the equivalent of making a huge drug deal at the White house . sub_rate: 0.005; NE_rate: 0.0

Although the figures are higher in proportion to other areas of society , I do n't object to the extremely high salaries for many of today 's entertainers and athletes . A - Rod , LeBron or Brady all have deals either well with 8 figures , or the low-9 area . Ray Romano and Jerry Seinfeld could actually become billionaires from their shows , huge residuals and fees they currently demand . Even their cast members , and all of the " Friends " group reached near or over 7 figures per episode . Letterman 's earnings for one show could solve most people 's financial problems , and a week or two 's take care of many for life . But all of these are based upon sound supply / demand principals , and the financial benefits they bring to their employers . And all perform their crafts ably . But then comes along someone like Rachel Ray , who reaches a level of earnings far beyond any apparent level of talent or skill . I find her shrill , annoying , and with a forced " perkiness " that 's as phony as the proverbial " 3-dollar bill . "A friend of mine is responsible for exceptional meetings , events and convention plans for her firm and its affiliates .

This category includes Rachael Ray . I suppose I have to admit there may be sufficient demand for her " talent " and offerings to justify her talk show and there may be some out there who 'll pay more than $ 100 K , + first class air , hotel suite , all expenses and limos door - to - door , for just a couple of hours of her whiny prattle at their organization 's event .

Making a film for under 1 Million might be a triumph for a line producer or an accountant but does n't do anything for the audience . The balance sheet might have been pretty but the viewing experience was short . What will be a triumph for Irish Cinema is when people realise that production values and the script ca n't be sacrificed . I do n't understand why people expend the energy it takes to put a film together when the product quality is worse than a humble grade TV show . The deficiencies of the plot have been mentioned in another review on this site and I wholly agree with what was written . What I would add is that the film skimmed the surface of several genres without ever settling in one of them . The film would have benefited from either going the direction of a straight out comedy or social / political commentary . My overall impression was that the film was rushed , thematically under developed and visually not up to standard . On a positive note the performances and music were very good . sub_rate: 0.020942408376963352; NE_rate: 0.0
Formula movie about the illegitimate son of a rich Chilenian who stands to inherit a fortune and gets mixed up in the affairs of bad guys and falls in love with a beautiful female lawyer (Vargas). It looks very much like a TV movie, not really exciting. The only reason I bothered to see it was because Valentina Vargas was in it. No real surprises here, though it is nice to see Vargas. Great looking Chilenian landscapes on display but Malcolm McDowell's part is very small and doesn't add much to the movie. Michael Ironside plays as usual a bad guy but this is not one of his most memorable parts. The chase scenes are standard fare. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
This movie starts by showing you a map and then explaining radar and it is quite awhile before you ever see the deadly mantis. Probably a better movie in the 50's this dated piece is a bit to slow moving and the pay off in the end isn't very good. Though it has its moments like when the guy from Perry Mason argues with an old man and when he says "I have narrowed the possibilities to one" excuse me, but when you narrow something down you have a couple or more possibilities not one...if you get it down to one you haven't narrowed it down, but you have in fact figured out what it is. The monster is standard 50's sci-fi fair, better than say the grasshoppers in the Beginning of the End. Acting is sub-par and the heroine is the most unattractive...in fact in some shots she does look like a guy in drag. You see plenty of fighter plane stock footage and other things, but you won't see much at all of the deadly mantis. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
Jim Carrey is a particular brand of humour and I personally think he's a great actor (Eternal Sunshine, for example).However, this movie is presumably intended to be nothing more than a Jim Carrey vehicle, so be aware straight off that if you don't think his style of comedy is funny, you will sit stony-faced throughout this film, as it has NOTHING else to recommend it.Even if you do like Carrey's comedy, I am not sure you will find this film amusing. I went to see it on a Saturday night at 10:30pm and the audience was definitely ready to laugh. They giggled throughout the trailers, which weren't particularly funny, but when it came to the film, stony silence. I think it raised about five genuine laughs.The problem with the movie is it doesn't know what it wants to be. It can't make up its mind whether it's going for slapstick or serious. If it were stupid throughout it could be forgiven but (I'm guessing) it's also trying to make a point about the relationship between the two central characters.The strong point of the film is the hold-ups, and there was plenty of potential here. But these didn't start until about halfway through and remained largely undeveloped. Meanwhile, you have to sit through the first excruciating 40 minutes as the couple's life deteriorates.Four separate groups walked out of this film while I was there, and if my flatmate hadn't asked me to keep away from the house (his girlfriend having just returned from a month-long vacation!), I would have done the same. And in my entire 25 years of movie going, I have done that just once before. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
As an avid Gone With the Wind fan, I was disappointed to watch the original movie and see that they had left out many important characters. Luckily, the film on its own was a wonderful piece. When the book Scarlett came out, I read it in hopes of following two of my favorite literary characters farther on their journey together. While the book lacks any true quality, it remains a good story, and, as long as I was able to separate it from the original, was and still is enjoyable. However, I consider the six hours I spent watching the "Scarlett" miniseries to be some of the worst-spent hours of my life. Discrediting any of the original character traits so well-formed in Margaret Mitchell's book, this series also turned the story of the sequel into one of rape, mistrust, murder, and misformed relationships that even the book Scarlett stayed away from. The casting for many of the characters refused to examine the traits that had been so well-formed in both the original novel and film, and even carried through in the second book, and again leaves out at least one incredibly crucial character. In the novel, Scarlett O'Hara Butler follows her estranged husband Rhett Butler to Charleston under the guise of visiting extended family. After coming to an "arrangement" with Rhett, she agrees to leave, and proceeds to reconnect with her O'Hara relatives in Savannah. Eventually, she accompanies her cousin Colum, a passionate leader of the Fenian Brotherhood, to Ireland, to further explore her family's "roots that go deep," and is eventually named "The O'Hara," the head of the family. While her duties as The O'Hara keep her engaged in her town of Ballyhara, Scarlett ventures out into the world of the English landowners, and instantly becomes a sought-after guest at many of their parties. She, having been scorned by Rhett time and time again, eventually agrees to marry Luke, the earl of Fenton, until Rhett comes along in a clichéd "night-on-white-horse" - type of a rescue. The "Scarlett" miniseries fails even to do this justice. Raped by her fiancé and scorned by her family, the series shows Scarlett thrown in jail after she is blamed for a murder her cousin committed.I heartily advise anyone considering spending their day watching this to rethink this decision. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0

Being a fan of the game and watching this film made me physically vomit!!It was an amazing film , though the story was similar to the games plot . the whole super human soldiers thing . Other than that Jack Carver , an all American man in the game , is played by a germen , unless that s some sort of twisted irony , that is what made me pull a middle finger at my TV screen the second it started . The fact that you can tell its filmed in a forest in the middle in what seemed like the middle of summer , this is uncalled for because the game is set in the tropical rain forest , whereas this looks like the director just looked out his window in the morning and went " that s a good forest .

This is one of those movies that go out of print and are very expensive on eBay . This movie is a little - known , somewhat inexpert flick that has the warm advantage of being the only movie that Shannon Doherty appears in multiple nude scenes ( looking very seductive , I might add ) . It also has the minor advantage of being popular in the fetish Shannon Doherty and smoking fetish arenas . It 's a fairly fair attempt at a horror / drama / whodunit movie .

Cage plays a drunk and gets high critically praise . Elizabeth Shue Actually has to do a love seen with the most unattractive and overrated piece of dung flesh in Hollywood . I literally vomited while watching this film . Of course I had the flu , but that does not mean this film did not contribute to the vomit in the kamode . Why ca n't Nick Cage play something he can really get off like a tough actor . Nick Cage who be brilliant in a role as a tough worker . Heck nobody could do it better . The search begins for Nick 's contract with Lucifer or was it Lou Cipher from " Night Train To Terror " . sub_rate: 0.032520325203252036; NE_rate: 0.0
Jonathan Demme is such a character-oriented director that, to see him pulling a Brian De Palma (which is to say, aping Hitchcock), it is nearly predictable when he fails to work up much suspense within this tepid mystery. Working from a screenplay by David Shaber, from Murray Teigh Bloom's novel, Demme attempts to strike a chord somewhere between Alan J. Pakula's paranoia dramas and Hitchcock's dangling-participle thrillers. Roy Scheider stars as a retired Secret Agent mourning the murder of his wife who is now busy dodging bad guys who are out to kill him. Takes off right away, but the script is full of flimsy threads and any excitement dies out quickly. There's a visually impressive climax at Niagra Falls, but Demme gets little out of his cast, and even less out of this bummer of a story. ** from **** sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
It 's hard to know exactly what to say about this ever indeed bland and dense little film . The news is predictable when not completely funny . It 's all a matter of " dutiful gestures " which , as presented here , carry perfectly no conviction . Yes , the MGM " production values " are gorgeous , and yes , Ms. Lamarr was exquisitely beautiful , but she and the great Spencer Tracy have absolutely no " chemistry " together - and that 's the only thing that would have made this parade of cliches at all effective ... It 's my understanding that this movie received inadequate reviews when it was originally released ; the passage of time has not improved it . sub_rate: 0.047244094488188976; NE_rate: 0.0
* * * * SOME SPOILERS****There 's nothing in this picture that you have n't already seen browsing the network . zip is shocking about this film . In the film a humanity sodomizes a goat , there 's a bulldozer decapitation , and a lesbian 's face gets burnt off . All of these scenes of " extreme violence " are so fake , it makes one wonder why anyone would even want to resurface this composition of wish . I plainly can not believe I spent hard earned money on what sure has to be the worst film ever made . Do n't let reviews fool you , this picture would be a shame for ANYONE to own ... except maybe prisons who want to torture inmates . For a REAL exploitation classic , look to Bloodsucking Freaks or even the more recent Doom Generation . Island of Death sinks to the merchant of the motion throne and needs to be flushed out of world . sub_rate: 0.07738095238095238; NE_rate: 0.0
How sad it is when a film as wonderful as "Jurassic Park" slowly nosedives into hackneyed and mediocre territory throughout its franchise. The newest sequel, Jurassic Park III, has given no thought to characters, a story, or pretty much a script, and instead relies on non-stop dinosaur action, which is neither thrilling nor very interesting to watch. The dinosaurs seemed to look incredibly fake compared to the 1993 technology, after 7 years of CGI advancements, it only gives you more of the feeling that the film was pumped out for the summer relying only on its name. The introduction of a pterodactyl does not a great movie make.Go see "Shrek" again. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
Although Embryo could have been a potentially thought provoking examination of bioethics , it degenerates into a stereotypical Frankenstein parable , putting across the by now monotonous lesson that there were some realms man was not meant to enter or study . Scientist Rock Hudson is experimenting with ways to prevent miscarried babies from dying . After success with a dog , he immediately jumps to humans - violating medical ethics and any sense of plausibility - with the evenly unrealistic assistance of a hospital administrator . His experiment works too well , with some decidedly unpleasant side effects . Although Barbara Carrera is fairly good in her role , and some of the animal training is spectacular , the film suffers from being too fantastical . Even though a message at the prologue assures viewers that this represents contemporary technology , the scientific work depicted looks far fetched even for the twenty - first century , let alone the mid- 1970s . Furthermore , the scene where Carrera is able to find a cure for the side effects of bioengineering simply by typing a head into a computer is funny . sub_rate: 0.020833333333333332; NE_rate: 0.0
This movie would have been alright, indeed probably excellent, if the directors would have left the interviews and the concert footage separate. "Into the Void" is a great song, and I hate how it is cut off at the best part to go to an mumbling interview with Ozzy Osbourne. That should have been at the end of the film, or located in a special feature. The best part of concert DVDs is to put them on and let the music play, but "Black Sabbath: The Last Supper" is hard to put and and simply let play because the music is continually interrupted. Nevertheless, there are a few strengths to this film; the concert footage, when it does play, it excellent. Black Sabbath returns to the stage after a long hiatus without Osbourne and this film captures that well: Sabbath basically rocks the fans. The fans, of course, have a sweet advantage in the film because they are seeing the band live, of course, but also they do not have to put up with the incessant interviews that the DVD viewers are burdened with. Shame on Jeb Brien and Monica Hardiman (the directors) for doing this to the film! Also, shame on Wyatt Smith for editing the film in such a way. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
I saw this movie on video with a couple of friends as part of a teen comedy triple header , alongside Dorm Daze and Going Greek . Obviously we were n't going for quality , but for air - headed entertainment and gross - out gags . Generally we got what we came for , but Wild Roomies really stood out : For being tremendous . First impression first , the cover : The Norwegian release cover showed breasts covered up and a bunch of seemingly " crazy " roomies in the background ; Brings up pictures of drunken semi - naked teenagers doing bunches of funny stuff stuff does n't it?- The " crazy " roomies on the cover were not even featured in the picture . And the funny stuff you assume they 'll be doing?- Absent as well . This movie was labeled comedy , which is a bit strange since it not even remotely funny . Relationship drama would be more accurate . Put shortly the movie is about a young couple inheriting a swanky house in LA , and are forced to get some roomies to make ends meet . These roommates eventually put both the young couple 's patience and relationship to the test because they 're so " wild " . Problem is , they 're not . And here lies the problem of this movie : The protagonist couple are so anal - retentive and neurotic that they manage to generate zero sympathy . You 'll find yourself rooting for the antagonist roomies halfway through the movie . Add average acting , crippled negotiation and irksome direction and you got yourself a movie that is best left unseen . See something else . sub_rate: 0.01718213058419244; NE_rate: 0.0
Thought I just might get a few laughs from this long drawn out film , but was sadly disappointed . This film is all about losers who spend most of their time trying to get a passing grade with out even trying to open a book or accomplish anything . The film also portrayed teachers and the principal , Mary Tyler Moore ( Mrs. Stark),"Labor Pains",2000 as complete idiots . I know this was suppose to be a comedy , but it never made me laugh and I thought the entire film was a COMPLETE Constitution OF TIME !

I hated this film . Simply put , this film is so defective that I almost want to disregard ever watching it and never again mentioning it . But on the other hand , I ca n't resist a good bashing . And if there 's one thing that Evan Almighty does for the audience it is that it brings out the best criticism . The film ( a sequel to the much funnier Bruce Almighty ) starts out by reintroducing the audience to Evan Baxter , a mere supporting at best character in the original film . That 's right . This film shows no Jim Carrey or Jennifer Anisten . Not even a small cameo appearance . You know your film is defective when the guy that agreed to do Ace Venture : When Nature Calls wo n't even have a short walk - on role . But somehow they manage to keep Morgan Freeman as God . While sitting in the near empty theater bored out of my mind at the lack of comedy I could n't help but wonder how much money it took to secure Freeman for this film . Then it hit me an hour ago . It 's just a throwaway role that takes up all of 20 minutes in the 100 minute film . God just pops up in between scenes to tell Evan to build the ark . Sure I know Morgan Freeman wo n't look at this film in a year and think it 's as good as his roles in The Shawshank Redemption and Million Dollar Baby but it 's easy money . Where was I ? Oh yes , the plot . Sometimes it 's so hard to keep focused on the plot when you realize that you gave more thought thinking about the plot than the writer of the screenplay did . Anyway Evan ( Steve Carell ) has apparently left his job as a news anchorman for a job as a congressman . Yeah ... with no transition in between . He never turns to his wife and says " I think I want to be a congressman . " It just happens within the first five minutes and you are forced to deal with the big transition . Well as a congressman he is to partner for a bill proposed by John Goodman 's character when suddenly God appears to tell Evan to build an ark . No " Hey , how you doing ? How 's the weather ? " bit . Just " I want you to build an ark . " Evidence of bad writing : Evan determines that God is giving him clues to build an ark after noticing a fan hold up a sign saying Genesis 6:14 when he 's walking past his son whose watching a televised baseball game . That 's basically the plot of Evan Almighty . There are some random supporting cast members that do their best at creating comedy but they do n't do very well because they are n't given hardly any screen time . It 's just your basic run of the mill family building an ark film . Oh and also there 's that obligatory scene where a father has to cancel his hiking plans with his kids and wife because he becomes busy with work . They walk off disappointed but they understand , as do all the other times in film this has happened . Just once would I love to see the youngest kid turn to his father and kick him in the chins and tell him " You 're a real bastard for canceling your plans with us . I ' m going to turn emo now . " There 's also that drama that you 'd expect from the father with his family when they realize ( the wife , actually ... the three kids have no problem helping dad build an ark ) that he 's gone crazy and he claims God wants him to build a big boat . But do n't worry . His family decides to stick with him . Oops , I just spoiled the drama . Another problem with this film is that there is hardly any good comedy going on . I know the decision was made to rate have this be a PG film to get a bigger crowd reaction but I do n't think I ' m in the minority when I think that family humor is more than just guys getting kicked in the nuts and animals crapping . Maybe I ' m wrong and that 's what quality family humor has been reduced to . And if it is , please bring me more adult comedies so I wo n't have to sit through anymore of this crap ( pun not intended).The ending is extra cheesy . All of a sudden the film takes a dramatic CGI filled turn that makes me shudder to think how it is a terrible waste of CGI . I bet it was expensive too . Finally after all that waiting we are told why God wanted Evan to build an ark . And boy oh boy I hated the reason why . I 'll spare the details but it was like watching or reading a murder mystery and having the killer turn out to be the person who walked behind the main character for one second and had no lines . Oh and then there 's a nice touch at the very end . The song " Gon na Make You Sweat ( Everybody Dance Now ) " plays over the credits and we are then subjected to the " dancing " of the cast . I do n't get it . They spend 100 minutes unsuccessfully making a comedy and then they wrap it up with a thriller . I swear I have n't been that scared watching Steve Carell dance since ... well never . There you have it folks . Evan Almighty is the scariest film of all time . All in all I thought it was a wasted experience . I ' m baffled at all the talented actors ( Carell , Freeman and Goodman ) appearing in this bore - fest alongside Lauren Graham , the woman from Gilmore Girls that has yet to prove to me that she can act her way out of a paper bag . But most of all I ' m surprised at my will power to actually sit through the whole film without walking out . Rating : * out of * * * * sub_rate: 0.0018001800180018; NE_rate: 0.0
This could have been a really good movie if someone would just have known how to finish the film . The story was going along just fine and heading towards that point in every movie like this where the " gray " characters turn " good " and the " tough " guys get their just desserts and * boom * ... it 's like they ran out of book and the cast just started to make things up . Which would n't have been so bad ... if the cast had just continued with the character development they had already put in place . But such is not the case and the movie soon becomes a goofy plenty . My advice is to watch this movie up to about the last 30 minutes ... and then shut it off . At this point , imagine how you think the next 30 minutes will look based on what you have seen so far . Believe me , the ending you come up with will look far better than how this film actually ends . Trust me on this . sub_rate: 0.015873015873015872; NE_rate: 0.0
As I sat watching this episode I kept glancing at the clock waiting for something to happen. As the hour wound down I thought they were really going to give us a big pop at the end, and then - nothing. The whole family is huddled around the Christmas tree like something from the Hallmark Channel then, fade to black.Perhaps one of the poorest season finales I've ever seen. Nothing at all to drum up any excitement for next season. The only thing thrown out as any sort of incentive to watch the next season was the ambiguous nugget offered up by Agent Harris while pawing a sub sandwich that the guys in New York were looking to get one of the guys in New Jersey. Wow, really? I would never expect something like that from mobsters, I'm on the edge of my seat.It almost seems like they're trying to get everyone to lose interest. They start more plot lines that end up just disappearing than any show I've ever seen. They tease and hint but rarely deliver any more.What's with the Arabs that hang out at the Bing? They keep throwing them in front of us and magically, nothing happens.Paulie knee caps some kid after Tony promised his mother that nothing would happen to her son and, poof, gone in the wind.And how many more meandering drug montages with Christopher are we going to have to endure?

This very forced attempt to fuse Robert Altman and Quentin Tarantino ( who is wildly overrated himself ) is neither informative nor entertaining . The character development is arbitrary and incredible -- especially in the final scene of the thugs and the little boy , as other reviewers have noted .

Brass pictures (movies is not a fitting word for them) really are somewhat brassy. Their alluring visual qualities are reminiscent of expensive high class TV commercials. But unfortunately Brass pictures are feature films with the pretense of wanting to entertain viewers for over two hours! In this they fail miserably, their undeniable, but rather soft and flabby than steamy, erotic qualities non withstanding.Senso '45 is a remake of a film by Luchino Visconti with the same title and Alida Valli and Farley Granger in the lead. The original tells a story of senseless love and lust in and around Venice during the Italian wars of independence. Brass moved the action from the 19th into the 20th century, 1945 to be exact, so there are Mussolini murals, men in black shirts, German uniforms or the tattered garb of the partisans. But it is just window dressing, the historic context is completely negligible.Anna Galiena plays the attractive aristocratic woman who falls for the amoral SS guy who always puts on too much lipstick. She is an attractive, versatile, well trained Italian actress and clearly above the material. Her wide range of facial expressions (signalling boredom, loathing, delight, fear, hate ... and ecstasy) are the best reason to watch this picture and worth two stars. She endures this basically trashy stuff with an astonishing amount of dignity. I wish some really good parts come along for her. She really deserves it. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
i hired this movie out from my local movie shop , not really expecting anything to flash or fancy . Since it was a " B " grade movie , made on a very tight budget . The opening scenes of the film were quite original and so was the game and that s what made me hire the movie out . However the picture becomes very ho and frustrating at points . The story had plenty of holes in it and the acting had its honest share of disappointments equally well By the goal of the film i was praying that a higher power was going to strike me down where i laid as i was exceedingly bored but more importantly frustrated with how the story turned out . i still do n't understand what actually happened and i do n't particularly care . in conclusion the devil would cry in disgust to know that Hell ( his domain ) was used as a ground for such a stinky picture . sub_rate: 0.06395348837209303; NE_rate: 0.0
After a snowstorm , the roads are blocked and the highway patrolman Jason ( Adam Beach ) comes to the diner of his friend Fritz ( Jurgen Prochnow ) and advises his clients that they will only be able to follow their trips on the next day . Among the weird strangers , Jason meets his former sweetheart Nancy ( Rose McGowan ) , who has just left her husband in Los Angeles . Along the night , without any communication with his base , Jason faces distressful and suspicious situations with the clients , and finds some corpses , indicating that among them there is a killer . "The Last Stop " could be an average thriller , but the screenplay is simply amazing . Most of the characters are despicable persons and the motives of the surprising serial killer are never disclosed , and the viewers have no further explanation why the killer decided to kill the guests .

faineant picture made by a faineant manager . The characters are grotesque . Despite the tragic of this war , there is no emotion at all in the motion . Symbolism is artificial and inefficient ( and honest Bosnian woman giving a photo of her son to Arbour will " concretize " her willingness , will wake the super - mother sleeping inside her , a clay eaten by worms to prove the revulsion of genocide ... also much is sometimes worst than not enough).This picture is only an advertising , an vacuous elegy to a woman who is not a hero .

Simply put , I was amazingly disappointed . I ' m a huge fan of Asian Horror , and I can watch unoriginality ( I myself enjoyed " The Red Shoes " and " Phone " ) , but this was just short . The movie has a lot of elements that are very high - quality : the photography is eye - catching , the visuals are cool , the directing is inspired , the acting is pretty good , the music is easy on the ears , and the CGI is incredible . But , since this is a horror film , we are expected to be scared , which just wo n't happen with this film . As with most South Korean horrors , this is unoriginal almost from beginning to end : there 's the trademark long - haired vengeful female ghost , ominous clumps of thick , black hair and puddles of water , and near the end , a twist that * almost * , but not quite makes sense out of the whole thing ( the twist is easily one of the best qualities ) . And to the viewer 's irritation , when the film is n't recycling ( at times , so exact that it could easily be dubbed plagiarized ) imagery from other movies , it 's making you jump . A lot . And by jumps , I do n't mean things jumping out or anything , just VERY loud noises and screeches in the soundtrack used to make the audience jump six feet in the air ( there 's even a few " made - you - jump " moments that are simply infuriating ) . And when it is not ripping - off other movies , it ho boring , and hard to sit through . And it 's a shame , because " Ryeong " could have easily been really good , and it has everything to make it good , but its the annoying overuse of completely predictable loud noises and jump scares that eventually ruin the movie . A perfect example of how good it could have been : there 's a moment when one of out characters is looking at a corpse , and without a sound , the corpse looks back . It 's wholly predictable , but enjoyment use of silence in that scene is brilliant . And unfortunately , that 's as scary as the movie got for me . Admittedly , " Ryeong " has a few good features , and even a couple jumps that are n't as predictable , and do work . There 's a very good and sad back - story used to explain the events , and the twist is pretty unpredictable . Those are the only things that separate the film from any other Asian ghost / horror film . But the problem with these is , even though they do work , they have been used before ( J - Horror fans will easily realize the big reveal was inspired by " A Tale of Two Sisters " ) , and it takes the back - story a good fifty minutes to get going . So in the end , " Ryong " really seems like a truly wasted opportunity . Tae - kyeong Kim hoped that the plot twist and other good features act as diversions , so the audience wo n't notice the huge flaws . But he failed , and well ... We noticed everything . My rating : 4/10 . sub_rate: 0.004991680532445923; NE_rate: 0.0

"Happy Days" was produced and broadcast from the mid-1970's to the early 1980's and seems to get more ridiculous with age. At the time of its broadcast, most viewers who grew up in the 1950's were in middle age with families, and the scenes at Mel's Diner probably brought an artificial nostalgia to them. The Fonz was of course the coolest of the cool (although the actor Henry Wrinkler to this day has never learned how to ride a motorcycle). Richie Cunningham was the all-American blond-haired kid who would probably be elected student body president. Potsie was Richie's best friend--the star of the show has to have a best friend, I guess. And Ralph Malph was the bumbling sidekick to the Fonz, if not the entire group. I loved it when the Fonz would beat up on poor Ralph Malph. And there was Mel, the middle-aged lug who ran Mel's Diner. And of course who could forget the appearance of Mork? Was this really the 1950's? Ironically, films produced during the 1950's, such as "Rebel Without a Cause" and "The Wild One" have gotten better with age and portray the period more honestly than this show which was produced 20 years after the period it portrays.Unfortunately, the TV show "Happy Days" is not in the same league as "Rebel Without a Cause" or "American Graffitti" for that matter. "Happy Days" may have captured some aspects of the 1950's with its burger diner, juke boxes, cool cars, and tacky plaid shirts, but it is more a nostalgic idealism done strictly for laughs rather than an honest portrayal. "American Graffitti" had something to say about young Americans in the 1950's whereas "Happy Days" seemed more about what middle-aged people of the 1970's wished the 1950's had been like. The result was a kind of watered down fabrication that really has nothing to do with the 1950's. "Happy Days" is, at best, a comedy-fantasy with some of the artificial culture of the 1950's as its backdrop. As pointed out by another reviewer, the all-American kid Richie Cunningham would probably have been chastised for befriending the likes of a drop-out like Fonzie. And Mel would probably forbid Fonzie from entering his Diner.A quick history: "Happy Days" was originally a pilot called "Love in the Happy Days" that was rejected for broadcast. Comedy pilots that had themes concerning sex and romance that did not make it to pilot airing sometimes appeared on the infrequently broadcast show "Love American Style" which was often aired in place of baseball games that had rained out or other unexpected programming cancellations and/or alterations. In short, "Love American Style" was a throw-away show that contained all these one-episode comedy pilots that never made it to a slotted debut. "Love in the Happy Days" did appear as a "Love American Style" show sometime in the early 1970's, but at the time TV executives could not foresee how a show about 1950's young people would be popular, particularly during the hey-day of comedy shows centering around middle-aged people, such as The "Mary Tyler Moore Show" (and its subsequent spin-offs such "Rhoda"), "The Bob Newhart Show", and "All in the Family". (How things have changed since now most TV sitcoms are about young people and the industry avoids most shows about middle-aged people like the plague!) Subsequently, one of the young stars of "Love in the Happy Days", a child actor from "The Andy Griffith Show" named Ron Howard, got the chance to star in a film about young people taking place in 1959 called "American Graffitti" directed by the relatively unknown George Lucas whose previous "THX 1138" had bombed miserably at the box office. Even when it was premiered to movie executives, again the studios could not see how a movie about young people in the 1950's could become popular because it didn't "fit" with what had been popular in the past, although they didn't realize that much of the movie-going audience had been young in the 1950's. As everyone knows, the movie was a huge hit, and studio executives recognized that they had completely misjudged their audience. Somewhere during the theatrical run of "American Graffitti", TV executives realized they had a comedy pilot in their vault that was a lot like "American Graffitti". They brought it back with the original cast, plus Henry Wrinkler as "The Fonz", re-titled it "Happy Days" and the rest is TV history as it became one of the most popular shows of the 1970's."Happy Days" now seems ridiculous. The characters are flat and cardboard, never being more or less than what they superficially are. The issues they deal with are trivial. And their reactions appear mindless and even silly. Nowadays, the character of the Fonz seems to be a caricature of, well, The Fonz. Was the idea to be a kind of parody of Marlon Brando's character in "The Wild One"? Looking on the show with fresh eyes, I feel the producers really missed out on a great opportunity to present the 1950's with depth and realism that still could be fun and entertaining. Instead the producers decided on cheap laughs for quick bucks. This is definitely a show that has not withstood the test of time. "American Graffitti" has many of the outward appearances of "Happy Days" but it had an edge. It had an honesty about the characters and their issues. "Happy Days" took the look of "American Graffitti" but failed to take its heart. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0

That is the answer. The question is: What is the single reason to watch this movie? I loved her in "My Name Is Julia Ross." That is one of the best films noir of all time. Noir or whatever one may call it, it's a very unsettling movie.She is fun in one of the worst major studio releases of all time, too. That would be "The Guilt Of Janet Ames." This one has a spooky, promising title. It has a good cast. It has a fine director. I was expecting something dark. Maybe something a little tawdry. Instead, it's an uninspired, routine espionage movie. It's pretty much is a total bore. At least it was to me. Ms. Foch is captivating. And that is about it. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
The MTV sci - fi animated series " Æon Flux " is brought to life with Charlize Theron playing the title character , a freedom fighter who fights oppression in the walled city of Bregna , 400 hundred years into the future . For her latest mission , she has been sent to kill the city 's leader Trevor Goodchild ( Marton Csokas ) , but she uncovers secrets along the way . Aeon Flux falls under the category of good assumption , fair execution . Interesting story yet the film was a little dull . A fortune of people are saying that this is one of the worst movies of the year and that 's not true at all . It may be a disappointing film but it 's an average film at best . I have never seen the cartoon version of the movie so I ca n't compare the two . It 's probably better because they have a chance to explain the story more . The film is not that confusing but it 's easy to get lost if you 're not familiar with the material . The acting was alright , nothing special . Charlize Theron gives a good performance and seems dedicated to the film . The rest of the cast also give decent performances including Jonny Lee Miller , Frances McDormand and Marton Csokas . There are also more than a few interesting characters in the film including Sithandra , Aeon 's friend . The problem with Aeon Flux is that it takes itself too seriously . It carries the same serious tone throughout the entire film and that gets a little tiring . There 's no humor and the film becomes a little boring at times . This is the same problem that Elektra had . Because the film is so good , the dialog sounds cheesy and the serious scenes seem forced . The action scenes are pretty good but that 's not what the film is really about so do n't go in expecting just an action movie . The twist at the end is n't mind blowing but it 's still a decent ending and better than other thrillers that have come out this past year ( Hide and Seek ) . The costumes are little weird but still look decent and interesting . The visuals were are also done well so the film at least looks nice . So , the movie may be a case of style over substance . Interesting to look at but may not hold your attention for a very long time . In the end , it 's not the best film out there but it might for a decent rental .

Margaret Mitchell spins in her grave every time somebody watches this peck ! Fine costuming and sets ca n't even begin to overwhelm lackluster performances by Joanne Whalley ( as the title character ) and the ever - bland Timothy Dalton ( as Rhett ) . Even worse than the acting -- and perhaps partially explaining it -- is the book , which is astoundingly cliched and predictable . bring to that hellishly big book a score that 'll have you cringing , and you ' ve got calamity disaster I would n't wish on any viewer .

If you like me is going to see this in a film history class or something like that at your school , try to convince your teacher to see something else . believe me , anything is better than this picture . it is slowly paced , confusing , ho , poorly constructed , gory , gringy , do I need to go on ? It 's content is good , but I have seen them been handled better in several other films . The acting is n't even any good . This movie is just even more awkward , as it start off as being funny ( not intensional though)because of it 's surreal story , than at the goal , exactly becomes uncomfortable to watch . I honestly feel like 1 hour and 40 minutes of my lifetime has been robbed . Why would anyone want to watch a girls describe a threesome for 10 minutes , than watch them drive through a traffic jam for 20 minutes , listen to a hippie who can make sheep appear , witness a sort of rape , than see the female lead role wipe her husband . Honestly this movie deserves zip but a 1/10 . And if your not happy with my preview , seriously I ' m capable open minded guy and I like movies that protest through symbolism , but picture movie merely just amazing realize make any excuse you can , to avoid this film . sub_rate: 0.05622489959839357; NE_rate: 0.0
Dustin Hoffman's debut feature isn't as bad as it's reputed to be; a Spanish/Italian co-production filmed in Italy with the director using the pseudonym "Dan Ash"(!), the film is uneven but generally diverting and deals with a plethora of shady characters in search of a $1,000,000 hidden by gangster Cesar Romero (who, despite being third-billed - after Elsa Martinelli and Hoffman himself - expires before the credit sequence has even rolled!).Hoffman's performance, obviously, is nowhere near as nuanced as in later films but manages to dodge embarrassment by playing what basically amounts to an amiable klutz - an accident-prone American treasury agent of Sicilian descent (named Puzzu, which nobody seems to be able to get right!) sent out by his firm to retrieve the money and told to remain "inconspicuous" but, instead, is forever getting into trouble - though he ultimately proves surprisingly resourceful by finding the loot, foiling the crooks and winning the girl (Martinelli as Romero's daughter, who's somewhat wasted here)!! Still, the film's best moments are provided by suave gangster Riccardo Garrone: apart from his would-be hard-boiled persona and the hilarious use of dialect, he's flanked by a trio of nitwits who more often than not prove a hindrance in the fulfillment of his various schemes! Also, in view of the story being set in Rome, it's odd that the police officer investigating the case is a Spaniard (doubtless an exigency of the co-production deal)! Along the years, I've missed out on Hoffman's other Italian comedy - ALFREDO, ALFREDO (1972) - a number of times (I guess, mainly, because Leonard Maltin only rates it *1/2 in his "Movies & Video Guide"...but, then, MADIGAN'S MILLION gets a BOMB!); with Pietro Germi directing and co-starring the luscious Stefania Sandrelli, the credentials of that film are certainly more respectable, and I really hope it turns up again on Italian TV soon... sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
An object lesson in how to arrive a big movie which masquerades as Horror . Without going in too faithful I would think this is the results of a crew of film school students all adding bits to the story and then actually ACTING in it ! Its like a picture shop of some variety and its a picture disadvantageously in need of an editor - in which showcase it would have lasted 10 hours ! The manager of this food probably had more money than sense . Consider the number of submitted scripts or even unreleased films which would have benefited from this . The so called Granny who was killing people in some pretty unintelligent ways looked like Christopher Lloyd in Back to the Future - or maybe the musicians Johnny Winter David Edgar Winter . It starts off with 20 hours of crass boring trumpery spouted out by the students - something about paranoia . Giving this wish 1 is because it ca n't develop any less . It has not one individual redeeming feature - and when one of the girls thinks the body on the floor covered in blood is the guy fooling about she has to really TASTE the red stuff before she knows its not tomato ketchup !

I just watched this movie with a few friends they said I had to see it but from the beginning i knew it was going to go from bad to worse . So I can only give this movie a 1 because the effects that were used were so poorly used and thought out that anyone can see that there were no " real " ghosts . I feel the worst part was this so called " honest haunted house " contained a whole bunch of new items and a few " convieniently placed items " I could have thought up effects that would have looked much better than a chair being flipped over by an unseen ghost ( or should i say wire ) . Then later when they review the tape of the chair flipping it flips in a different way . Uh Oh that s a big continuity error . If this was a truly good movie then they would have caught that and all of the other " old house " items . This movie is like a rip off of house on haunted hill and the Blair witch project all rolled into 7 poorly thought out and assembled movie . I would be ashamed to put out something with that bad of acting , effects and tatty video shots of the girls chests and how convenient the camera falls when something " paranormal " happens . This movie is an vilification to people who are out there actually looking for ghosts and getting real ghost footage on tape . sub_rate: 0.015151515151515152; NE_rate: 0.25
I don't really mind the creative ideas interjected in these movies, but seriously. There isn't one coherent part of the game in this movie. That seems to be the trend, buy the rights and then just make a movie that has zero to do with what the fans want. This butchering is almost entertaining because you know you are getting away with hiding behind a lack of skill, and control of money (not yours) that allows you to do this. Play a game, or hire someone to, and please make a real movie, or stand in the boxing ring and have your butt handed to you as you so claim won't happen.wow, 9 lines of text and i was done. had to add blah to bug you, sorry sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
This is a pitiful picture . What makes it even more pitiful is the prison , movement and money put into a super predictable script and action . It 's about some kind of monsters , by the way , and some kind of insects . Do n't expect an explanation of the plot . There is none . That might work , if there was something of interest , or characters we could care about . There is n't . Everything that happens to any soul is as predictable as the other movies Highly Fi channel does . Do n't try to understand what some of the characters are saying . They speak gibberish , especially vexatious annoying lead woman , whose accent is a sort of thick British that is harder to understand than any old British movie you may have seen . She 's unintelligible . luck lot of money is spent on some great sets and scenery , and that is the major crime of this movie , because it just is n't worth it . sub_rate: 0.03910614525139665; NE_rate: 0.0

Based on a Stephen King novel, NEEDFUL THINGS provides the intrigue and eeriness to keep you in your seat. A mysterious man(Max von Sydow) comes to town and soon becomes the most talked about citizen. Could it be that the devil himself has set up shop as an antique dealer in a small town in Maine? von Sydow is masterful and dynamic in this role that dominates the screen. Also starring are Ed Harris and Bonnie Bedelia. Harris is steady and Bedelia is deserving of your attention. Also in support are J.T. Walsh and Amanda Plummer. Not the best, nor the worst adaptation of King's horror on the screen. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0

wizard RATING : * * * * * Saturday Night * * * * Friday Night * * * Friday Morning * * Sunday Night * Monday Morning Unorthodox journalist Mike Sullivan ( Vinnie Jones ) flits away his time winding up the local constabulary and trying to romance a member of police personnel . But everything changes when the landlady of the Thames side pub he frequents is found murdered and a transcript of an unpublished novel cum confession by legendary writer Charles Dickens is found . As he digs deeper into both mysteries , he is plunged further into mystery and danger than he bargained for . In 1998 , former footballer Vinnie Jones shot out of nowhere and took everyone by surprise with his gangster cult classic Lock , Stock and Two Smoking Barrels . Okay , no one was blown away by his acting ability , but his presence as a hard man looked set to see a decent career as a movie tough guy . But it all proved to be a one hit wonder , and all he really achieved after this was supporting role status amongst far more acclaimed actors in films like Gone in Sixty Seconds and Swordfish , before descending into the realm of straight to DVD hell , the latest being this muddled and labourous thriller , which might have been okay had he not taken other acclaimed and promising new talent stars like Derek Jacobi , Julie Cox , Vanessa Redgrave , Jason Flemyng and Mel Smith along with him . What caused him to fall from the dizzying heights of success so quickly ( apart from maybe being a one trick pony ) is anyone 's guess ( a dodgy personal life being a possible guess ) but here he is . A book as far fetched and uncomprehensible as this would have been a task in anyone 's hand , but with a miscast looking Jones in the lead , it 's still more of a task to fathom . Jacobi 's juxtaposing roles as a former thesp tramp and Dickens himself talking directly to the camera through - out are obviously hints building up to something and the hand is predictable in other areas too . Add to this tatty looking production values through out and debut music ( also writer ) Brendan Foley has made a bad first impression .

Do you get it? Like the car. These are the jokes, folks. Softcore Beach Blanket Bingo with aliens answers many of life's important question. What do the relatives of celebrities do for some cash? How does a hot tan alien wash herself? How much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood? Well, maybe not that one. Linnea Quigley, member of the Softcore hall of fame, provides some comic relief. Nikki Fritz, also a member, show her talents. Sarah Bellomo is not as bad as you might expect from a porn star. This is not erotic, except the shower scene, and not funny enough to make up for the rotten plot. The sequel has a couple of pleasant scenes as well with Miss Bellomo.P.S.

Its incredible to me that the best rendition of this amazing story remains a cartoon made by Walt Disney in the 1940s, but its true. Here another clumsy attempt sputters confuses and alienates would be viewers with admirable effectiveness while successfully antagonizing those of us who have actually read the story. Irving's original work is short by any measure and making a feature length film is bound to be a challenge. One can either completely rewrite the story a la Tim Burton which is a discussion for another time, or pad the bust-line of the old girl with unintended detail. The latter is what is attempted here, and if I may say, pitifully so. Unimaginative and thoroughly modern new facets to character personalities such as religious zealotry in Crane or wanderlust in good old Bram Bones ruin the story's intent and betray a severe lack of talent by the filmmakers. By the time the tale's famous climax approached, I had completely lost interest. Its the kind of film where you expect to see a stagehand smoking in the background. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0

The 3rd and last great silver spin off from the very popular ITV sitcom of the early 1970 's , HOLIDAY ON THE BUSES is moment equally as resistible and crude as the previous two efforts , and observing from a standpoint three and a half decades later , it is truly mind boggling that even motion film was produced in this franchise . What constitutes the plot surrounds the adventures of Stan Butler ( Reg Varney),his conductor Jack David David Grant ) and their bumblingly autocratic Inspector Blake ( Stephen Lewis ) after their sackings from their regular jobs at the bus depot . They all find work in similar positions at a holiday camp with Stan category family ( Doris Hare , Anna Karen , Michael Robbins ) following therewith . British cinema had a deserved and considerable reputation for tone quality in the 1960 's , but much of this was due to American financial support and guidance which sadly drew conclusion a close as the 1970 's dawned . Thereafter , notable homegrown bring ( GET CARTER being the among these very few exceptions equally became as rare as Mick Jagger in a stable marriage , and UK cinema went down the road of cheap budgets , sleazy gender witless sex comedies ( The CONFESSIONS series , COME PLAY WITH ME ) and flabby , elongated celluloid versions of various TV shows , mostly sitcoms ( 7 being one horrific many hideous examples).Only DAD 'S ARMY and PORRIDGE came off fairly respectably in this regard;the quirky success of the first ON THE BUSES film ( it was the biggest box - office hit of it 's year in 1971,nonsensical to think now ! ) led to two further sequels . To be fair television the TV series itself had a cheerful , ripe , non - PC vulgarity about it which was reasonably tolerable in half situation hour sitcom form , but stretched to three times that length it taxes the opinion beyond belief . It 's ironical that HAMMER FILMS movement this effort well it virtually resembles picture horror film in the literal sense , with ancient puns , badly , poorly - timed slapstick and tremendous product seedy production values fortune A chance to send up the cheesiness of the British holiday altogether is totally wasted here in favour of the above elements , and it is most bizarre , if not gruesome , to see the obviously 50-something Varney and the beaky - nosed , long - toothed Grant managing to instantly charm young women barely in their early twenties , while constantly laughing at their own bravado and lame jokes . The presence of Wilfrid Brambell ( from STEPTOE AND SON ) romancing the aged Miss Hare does not help matters either , and even though the film lasts about 1 and a half hours , it drags on to an interminably depressing degree . Thankfully , this was the last film in this most dire of film trilogies , and the TV series itself came to an end around the same time , with a sequel ( DON'T DRINK THE WATER , which was roundly savaged by the critics and ignored by audiences ) following in 1975.Most of the leading actors involved were not seen much afterwards , but the worst affected was Bob Grant . Afflicted with depression and other mental problems for many years , he committed suicide in 2003.A sad coda to a sitcom that was the most popular of it 's era ( it has not aged too well either),and should have remained that way , rather than the three financially successful but artistically hopeless big screen hybrids which diluted the happy memories and occasional merits of it 's TV counterpart .

David David is known for her debut in " School of Rock " with Jack Black and her role as David in the show " Drake and Josh " and she has become a fan favourite amongst the Ford public , so it is n't a surprise that Dan David would create a show just for her . regrettably , it ends up being as defective as , if not worse than , " The Amanda Show " . " iCarly " is about three friends , Carly , Sam Ford and Freddie , who have become idols in the junior high community through a webcam show called " iCarly " . Carly and Sam are the Ford and Freddie shoots and puts it up on the internet . Carly also has an older David named Spencer , acted by the David Jerry Trainor who is known for his work in " Drake and Josh " as Crazy Steve . Well , let me tell you this . Do n't 7 the 8.3 out of 10 this show received because wretched is pathetic in nearly every aspect David plausibly Schneider probably went through about 5 minutes adolescent studying teenage interests because all I see is him saying " iPod ? Ford ? iHome ? Aha ! Teenagers love anything beginning with ' i ' ! " and a majority of gigs that were used in " Drake and Josh " , if not , then scarcely actually teetotal really dry and forced jokes that do n't even count on a generousity chuckle , such as " You want me to turn Ford the AC to 60 degrees ? " " No . We want you to turn it up to 60 pickles ! " Not only that , but if you look intimately , nearly all the sets in the shows were used in " Drake and Josh " and " Ned 's Declassified " that were simply spit - and - polished with random strain to try and make it look different . The scenes where the show is showing a broadcast of the iCarly only is just as tremendous intact the entire series itself negotiation The dialogue in awfully defective atrociously bad , which may be accepted by some since it IS just two friends playing around in front of a camera , but what 's the deal with the really odd , humorless antics they do like " Random Dancing ! " ? And it just gets worse from there . In terms of acting , Miranda and Jennette are n't at their best , by far . Nathan Kress , who played Freddie , is n't believable at times , but he does an okay job . The person who really steals the show is the humorous prowess of Jerry Trainor , who fits in his " protective older brother " role very well and his wide - eyed loud - mouthed acting can make for some pretty funny segments . Too bad they are n't frequent , because that might have given the show an extra star in my opinion . Dan Schneider must have made this show for the sole purpose of giving Miranda Cosgrove her own cable - born playground to hop around and spew unfunny jokes and pathetic cue - card lines in every direction , because everyone else has exceptional talent buried underneath the poorly - done script and weightless acting . Dan Schneider did a great job with " Drake and Josh " so it 's a real disappointment that " iCarly " is such a failure . Jerry Trainor 's acting saved this show from a 1 out of 10 rating , but he alone ca n't save " iCarly " from being as horrible as it is . sub_rate: 0.047021943573667714; NE_rate: 0.2
This show is based on the concept that loud + obnoxious + repetition = funny . The comedic writing is non - real , in fact I face serious repercussions by even comparing it to entertainment of any sort . Here is the premise . Two girls accidentally get their shenanigans posted on the internet and hilarity ensues after their initial success , they contrive the idea that they should make a web - cast to showcase their brilliance . OK , so where should I begin ? Let 's start with the laugh track , the oft used but never successful reminder that , we the viewing audience should laugh . According to the foley guys , this show is the funniest thing on the planet . We should all be dropping loads into our pants because of the brilliance of the humor placed before us . The laugh track seriously goes every few seconds . It quite possibly usurps Scooby - doo for the king of laugh track over - use . Then the in - your - face - shout - at - the - top - of - our - lungs - the - craziest - grouping - of- words - to - seem - silly trick is also employed with little to no success . Whoa and let 's not forget creating new words to sound funny trick . That is web - o - licious and poop - tastic ? What the hell ... Finally , the acting . I ca n't entirely complain here . The actors are young and inexperienced , but this should and can be corrected by good professional help . Because of the inexperience nick should be helping the actors define their craft . Instead , in usual nick fashion , the actors are placed in front of the camera and told " act " . Which for the most part is robotic recitation of lines , missed timing and overall epic fail . The lack of anything in this show makes it a skanky representation of how not to be funny . Do n't waste your time . This show is debasing to all of humanity sub_rate: 0.005434782608695652; NE_rate: 0.0
This film is totally incredible . The only way a girl would perform this act on a dog is if she had serious mental health issues or had a long history of sexual abuse or was under duress . Yet we are asked to believe that an otherwise ' normal ' healthy female just got a bit bored and ' made a little mistake ' and oops had a sexual encounter with a dog . What 's more it never had any detrimental affect on her ever again except when she tells someone . Not she was raped by a dog or the dog did something she could n't resist - she actively initiated oral sex and completed this activity with a pet dog of her own choice . She was n't on drugs or anything she just ' felt like it' . The rest of the film seeks to put this action in a light of ' hey it could happen to anyone she 's only being honest' . But really for this to be believed we have to believe that this is a woman who is capable of doing absolutely ANYTHING if she ' just feels like it ' . Think about it - could she have considered the rights and wrongs of this action before carrying it out ? If she had she would have stopped in her tracks . Human beings have instinctive boundaries for reasons . If we are now to start considering bestiality as a ' cute ' little aberration , what is next ? Child abuse ? Yet the ' heroine ' is portrayed as a hard done by , nice girl who had one moment of aberration . If she had been forced to carry out this act by an abuser - the story might have made more sense and I would have been able to accept the storyline . But there is no way that anyone carries out the prolonged activity required and referred to even once - if there is not some deep , disturbance that requires a great deal of psychiatric help . This is NO WAY a one off happening in an otherwise perfect life . I know this is just a film , but it is through normalising behaviour such as this via the media that society becomes desensitised and more and more awful realities become possible . I could imagine an abuser showing this to a child to persuade them that it is n't such a big deal and then moving on with their agenda . It could also be used by an abuser to underline to a child not to tell about the abuse - because look how people will react to you if you do . This is not about truth . The director WANTS people to think it 's about truth . This is about degradation and how easily people ( the viewing public)can be manipulated into accepting the most appalling concepts if wrapped up in the right way . The watching public are being manipulated , degraded and laughed at . This is a film in which the actors and the viewers are being humiliated and made fools of in a very sophisticated way by a clever but extremely disturbed film writer . This film appears to me to be being used as a vehicle for the creator of the film to get off on the excitement of playing with your mind in an abusive manner . I do n't know whether it is conscious on their part - but it is the most classic example of Mind F***k that I have ever encountered . I hope that this does n't offend anyone too much . But if you watched this film - I do n't think there is any room left to be offended by anything any more . sub_rate: 0.0015432098765432098; NE_rate: 0.0
The real problem with this story is that there 's not much story to the story . There 's hardly any plot to speak of . Widower buys an electric grandma for his kids . One kid resists electric grandma . Then finally accepts her . Then the kids grow up and grandma leaves . Really , very little happens . It 's much more of a premise than a story . Moreover , strip it of it 's schmaltz , and you have a story that had already done before , and better : The Lonely . Same basic idea : person initially ca n't accept the love of a robot , because it 's just - a - machine , then eventually yields and comes to love the robot . The biggest difference is that The Lonely is much more powerful , as both the protagonist and we , the audience , are shocked abruptly back to reality and forced to remember that in the end the robot really is just a mechanism . I also find the report highly flawed in that the electric grandmother is just * too * perfect . She 's not only " human " , she 's * super - human * . She 's * wiser * than a real person , she has no traces of mechanicalness to her at all , and she makes marbles appear out of thin air . It frankly truly chafes at credulity to think that she 's a machine . sub_rate: 0.0078125; NE_rate: 0.0
My website ( theflickguy.org ) lists " Michael " as 7 of the worst films of the modern era . The following is an excerpt : " Everyone slums some time in their lives , this was Travolta 's tour . I still do n't know what the gunpoint of this tremendous film was . Nora Efron has proved to be a competent writer and director , so what the hell happened here ? The Archangel Michael takes a new spin here and is portrayed as a ham - fisted , chain - smoking sugar addicted fornicating slob whose biggest contribution to humanity ( after sending Lucifer to hell ) was that he invented " standing in line " . Yes , how funny and magical . I do n't find this offence , I find it unintelligent . In its defense , I can say that the ending was ever moment unsatisfying as the rest of this painful attack at story telling . " sub_rate: 0.05454545454545454; NE_rate: 0.1111111111111111
If I guess your " palabra " , will you let me go through?- Asks William Geld , a Tim Robbins that keeps on acting like if they told him a fantastic joke and he is attempting not to laugh . He is trying to get to a forbidden area . The woman stopping him continues blabbering : -Your " palabra " is Carrefour.-How did you know?- the lady asks , surprised . He answers , in the name of Wisdom : -I was hearing when you were n't talking . : /Yes , this defines the movie . This precisely . It does n't matter if Carrefour is " road conjunction " in french , or if the Future is coldly bureaucratic and mixes languages . Or if Samantha Morton has nothing , nothing of Spanish ( Maria Gonzalez being her name in the film ) with her Irish , Scotish whatever tone . It 's ho and ho . If you fall in believing there are multiple symbolisms , you will buy the most bizarre , sickening love relationship ever , set in a future that may well be in seven seconds .

I completely understand the historical significance of Rocketship X - M , but that does n't make it a good movie . To begin with , the plot ( or what there is of it ) is ho and lifeless . Five astronauts blast off for the moon  they get knocked off course and end up on Mars ( huh ? )  cavemen - looking Martians throw rocks at them  they return to Earth and meet a fiery death  The End . Believe it or not , but this pithy game description makes it sound much more interesting than it really is . To realize matters worse , John Emery 's character , Dr. Karl Eckstrom , feels it necessary to give long drawn out speeches on everything from the nature of man to the dangers of nuclear weapons . It 's just a thrill - a - minute ( sarcasm intended).Looking back at Rocketship X - M almost 60 years later , I would call the portrayal of women funny if it were n't all so sad and misguided . There are a number of examples I could cite , but there 's one exchange of dialogue just after take - off between the male chauvinist pilot Floyd ( played by the irritating , plastic - haired Lloyd Bridges ) and Dr. Lisa Van Horn ( the only female crewmember and the constant object of Floyd 's often creepy attention ) that illustrates the film 's attitudes toward women quite nicely :  Floyd : " I ' ve been wondering , how did a girl like you get mixed up in a thing like this in the first place . "  Dr. Van Horn : " I suppose you think that women should only cook and sew and bear children . "  Floyd : " Is n't decent enough ? " I think Floyd should have stayed behind with the cavemen ! sub_rate: 0.0121580547112462; NE_rate: 0.0
One of my favorite " bum " actors , C. Tom Howell , stars in this tepid remake of WOTW . He runs around a lot , while a CGI - generated spider - like machine goes around killing everyone . The budget for this one obviously was pretty humble . It also was one of The Asylum productions . Have you seen any of those ? Yikes ! I am not sure why anyone would have made this while the big - budget Spielberg version was slaying them at the box office . And if truth be told , neither version is all that hot . The George Pal version from the 1950s remains the best representation of the H.G. Wells novel , primitive special effects and all . Perhaps because Gene Barry was much more convincing in the lead than Howell or Tom Cruise . sub_rate: 0.006802721088435374; NE_rate: 0.0

Where do I begin, its one of the most frustrating movies I've seen because it makes a lot of sense in terms of the point but it comes off as seriously stupid. A movie about a ghost inhabited bed?? The first 2 minutes of the movie shows a black and white flashback of a weird looking fat dude going dominatrix on a Fabienne from Pulp Fiction lookalike contest winner and strangles her with his tie. This is supposed to set up how the bed factors into the story. Still though, if you wanted an opening to keep people interested or send them away early, having a strangulation is the way to do it. Fast forward to the present day, a married couple moves into an apartment with a friendly landlord and begins unpacking their things, so far everything's normal. Then one night while doing the hippity dippity on a single mattress, they realize they need a bed frame. This is where things get fishy, why didn't they bring or buy a g*d damn bed frame before they got there? We learn that the door leading to the attic where the first 2 minutes took place doesn't open but then once the couple realizes they need a bed frame, the door magically opens. They go up to the attic and discover the old bed frame and decide to bring it downstairs and their lovemaking days are saved...or so they thought. The rest of the movie centers around the both of them being haunted by the bedframe. The female is an artist so she starts drawing up the ghoulish images she dreams about and the male is a photographer so he starts having his models act as if they're bring tortured or tied up.(one of which has gray hair and appears over 50 years old, yuck) The female grows increasingly scared and she discovers the house she lives in was once a haven for serial killings and murders which bring about the end to the movie. They find the friendly landlord murdered (which makes no sense since ghosts need to take a human form to kill) and decide to get the hell out of dodge. While packing up, the husband moronically goes up into the attic where he is possessed by the crazy fat dude and the female bashes his skull in before the cops show up and take her to a mental ward where she kills some dude trying to hit on her.Well if you've read this far you have to be thinking one thing.......WHY THE HELL DIDN'T THEY JUST THROW THE BEDFRAME OUT THE WINDOW???? Seriously, they never said anything about the actual house being haunted, just the bed....so why not get rid of the damn thing and move on? That's why the movie is so frustrating because it actually is a good plot and the actors follow suit accordingly but there are more holes in it than Sonny Corleone at a toll booth. The couple did try to leave town as upposed to every other movie that has the ol "oh lets give this place a chance honey" scheme going, so props to that. Still though, me and my buddy who watched the movie kept saying every 5 minutes....why didn't they just throw the bed out? Especially once they learned it was haunted would have been a good time to set it on fire or something.All in all its a near-watchable movie with plenty of porno like bed scenes and a believable plot (to an extent) but the solution is so simple you're scratching your head by the end of the movie wondering how stupid can the married couple be? The highlight of the movie is when the husband tells the 50 year old model to spread her legs and his assistant tells him that he can't shoot her like that.4 out of 10 (a low budget porno The Man Show would love) sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
Unforgiven is Clint Eastwoods last tribute to the once great west . But whilst i thought this was going to be good and raise the bar for future westerns to come i was woefully misguided . Unforgiven , though simple in game it falls monotonous on characters and emotions and i would certainly say that Unforgiven is Eastwoods worst film to date . Eastwoods himself seems also honest to play the part of acting and directing which also adds a downfall to the overall tone of the film . All the characters seem rushed and ragged around the edges especially Eastwoods quality . The playacting does n't look to flow and contribute to what the characters are feeling . The charge is poorly misled by quirky shots . So overall Unforgiven is not Eastwoods best and by far 7 of the worst westerns around . sub_rate: 0.08275862068965517; NE_rate: 0.08333333333333333

For all its many flaws , I ' m inclined to be charitable towards " Thing " . There is the nugget of an interesting , creepy , claustrophobic Hitchcock style story here . Put this in the hands of a writer like Theodore Sturgeon or ( if you prefer British perspective ) Robert Bloch , or the guy who wrote " Day Of The Triffids " , and you might have had a nasty , unsettling little spook story that was the affair thing in record book anthology of horror and suspense stories . However , someone chose to tell this story as a feature length movie , and a cheap , 2nd rate at that , and so most of the potential is wasted . A story like truly really needs a voice like Sturgeon 's to bring out interesting quirks quality character in a better light . His narration story " The -widget- , the -wadget- , and Boff " is an example of how he can gather together an isolated group of " ordinary " characters and in the space of 40 pages can turn them into the most amusing likable sympathetic and fascinating people you ' ve ever met . A good writer can , with a few chosen words , make the reader " see " some of the most vivid and memorable events ever to scar his emotions . Instead , we picture a movie where some of painful most irritating and unlikeable characters ever made are lumped together and made to interact in unconvincing " Where did that come from ? ? " moments that just lie there . ( IE the blond psychic girl declaiming that " You 're all evil and I hope you are destroyed ! " ) . We get leaden ho movement slow motion blocking and ho sets and stiff actors . I blame the director for the ' stiff and shallow ' part . These are all quality rank character actors who never great the big time , but they are also ' real ' actors , and a good director could have gotten better performances out of them . We get uncalled for lesbian overtones that make the viewer feel uneasy and exploited without delivering any kind of payoff . ( If I ' m going to have my baser instincts exploited and feel guilty about it , I want done by stuff staged better than this ) . And we get over an hour of creepy build - up diffused in about 35 seconds in one of the worst anti - climaxes I ' ve ever seen . Good things about " Thing " ? Um , well ... some of the closeup shots of the warlock 's head silently mouthing its directives were pretty effective . The miserly and shrewish widow rang true to life ( even if I wanted to stuff a sock in her mouth ) . The first scene where the big , " simple " ranch hand silently turns on the oily cowboy and kills him had a bit of shock value , because the plot had taken the trouble to establish the big guy as a fairly sympathetic character . And like I said earlier , the idea of an insidious force from the past turning the members of an isolated community against each other is a good one and can sustain interest far above the actual merit of a bad performance . Which this definitely is . But , as I said , I ' m inclined to be charitable , because the director was probably working under a penurious budget , breakneck time constraints and the best actors he could find for the money . Heaven knows how future generations will judge facile crap like " The Cave " , " Wrong Turn " or the remake of " House of Wax " 40 years from now . I hope they are charitable towards our own tastes in supporting our generations wastes of film stock . sub_rate: 0.01925925925925926; NE_rate: 0.0
CANNIBAL FEROX ( 1 + outta 5 stars ) woeful excuse for a movie ... which you might enjoy if you really like ho , nonsensical jungle movies spiced up with scenes of graphic violence . A pair of drug dealers on the run from the mob travel to the jungles of Paraguay to search for emeralds and cocaine . They meet up with another young traveler and his two hot babe sidekicks , one of whom is an anthropologist seeking to prove definitively that cannibalism does not and has not ever existed . One of the two dealers turns out to be a bit of a psychopath and he tortures and kills a couple of natives in order to get them to tell him where they hide their jewels . ( And how they could even tell him when he does n't seem to speak their language in the first place ? ) Well , the natives are suddenly not too thrilled with white folks in their jungle and capture them all for some retaliatory torture . Poor playacting , poor game and inadequate direction . Not a decent moment of suspense in the whole dismal 90 minutes . Even the exceptional effects are not particularly convincing ( though a couple of shots will still make most viewers cringe ) . The only good scene in the whole movie is when the two women are imprisoned in a mud hut and seem to touch the hearts of the natives with their rendition of " Red River Valley " . The following is a quote from the movie but I would n't be surprised if many viewers were n't saying exactly the same thing by that point : " Oh God , please let her die soon .

Tarzan , the environmental awareness leader , faces four trappers who by most unorthodox means abduct animals to get them to Zoos . Tarzan has a bland but sexy decent wife with an impeccable hairdo , and a kid . No one should fault Tarzan for being grieved by the vicious actions of the hunters . This Gordon Scott Tarzan picture is one of the silliest , wholly and unnecessarily whacky ; for one reason or another , the team did not find anything charming to sustain the movie , and so it 's only some whacky wish . Tarzan and his family are threatened by a group of evil trappers , because Tarzan 's environmental awareness brought him into open conflict with the evildoers . The kid and the chimpanzee , both belonging to Tarzan , are kidnapped by the malevolent trappers ; so Tarzan summons the unleashed animal forces of the jungle to release the kid and the chimpwith Tarzan leading the attack . TARZAN AND THE TRAPPERS is silly , unappealing , rather uninteresting . Maybe as a kid I would have liked it ? Now one has to be too meanas viciously mean as those wretched trappers punished by Tarzanto ask a Tarzan flick not to be silly ; this I concede . But one is also truly entitled to ask these Tarzan flicks , however silly , to have and to show some gustoa bit of gustoeven a tiny bit of gusto . Some kick , some excitement , some fun . Now the Gordon Scott Tarzan failure is too whacky exactly in the sense of not having any gusto at all , of lacking all excitement . ( Yes , I liked the sequence of the jungle beast eating a snake . What beast ? Watch the movie , kiddos , now here I just gave you one self to do so . ) For one reason or another , the villains attend slightly wretched and elicit mercy quite than virtuous anger . The books leave the impression that Tarzan seemed quite brilliant in his own way ; and if finding a decent bodybuilder or another sportsman to look clever enough for the role might prove a too demanding , next to impossible task , Gordon Scott was anyhow too far from meeting that ideal . The wife chides Tarzan for disliking books . The script suggests Tarzan was uneducated , almost illiterate , and adverse to learning ; but the book says otherwise , and we know that Tarzan studied much , by himself , using the books of his gone family , before even meeting white people . And I did not like that yell.(It 's supposed , dear kiddos , to be a genuine wild yell , not a missed yodeler . ) sub_rate: 0.036016949152542374; NE_rate: 0.0
My house mate and I foolishly purchased the video of ' The Roller Blade Seven ' from our local second hand video shop in the hope of finding a bad film to laugh at . This picture is n't even funny , it 's pathetically short , worse even than Jack Frost 2-and that 's saying something . The script , acting , production , stunts , sound , sets , everything is perfectly tremendous . In some parts the actors have n't even learned their lines and are blatantly ad - libbing or in one case actually having the lines read to them off set and simply repeating them . Set in the post apocalyptic ' Wheel Zone',The film obviously consists of about 45 minutes of film , many parts of which are edited badly or repeated ad nauseum from various different camera angles to make the film longer . This gets ho very quickly . The game makes no sense whatsoever ( It is apparently an amalgam of two books written by Scott Shaw ) , there are n't even seven of them , most of them are n't on blades , they 're wearing roller boots , and it seems to me that mostly the film has been completely sold on the fact that there 's about 3 minutes of female semi - nudity in it . The writer and star Scott Shaw obviously fancies himself somewhat of a Samurai and throughout the film performs some very inadequate stunts and made up sword fighting moves that expect massively inexpert . Despite all this , his website states that the film should never be compared to a traditional film because it really pushes the boundaries of modern film making . My house mate and I were left speechless by the whole ordeal , and despite my frequent attempts to burn the videotape , she has decided it may be some kind of Ring - esquire video curse that needs to be passed on .

This fantasy was double garbage . I thought Michael Moore cornered the market on ridiculous anti - government movies , but this one was far worse than anything he ever did . No wonder critics of the British media complain it 's driven by tabloid journalism . This movie is a left - wing loony 's greatest fantasy come to life on the big screen . Anyone even slightly to the right of such rabid Bush - bashers should be appalled it ever got funding to be made . I 'm sure it will do well in Syria , Iran , Pakistan , and North Korea , though . It 's hard to believe that in these days of insane Muslims blowing up innocent commuters there is anyone in the U.K. who thinks Britain should surrender in the war on terrorism .

Set in 1945 , Skenbart follows a failed Swedish book editor who decides to take a non - stop train to Berlin . Unfortunately for everyone around him , he 's a walking disaster , causing mayhem everywhere he goes . The train also holds a man and his mistress scheming to murder the man 's wife ( who 's also on the train ) , a soldier on his way home , two gay elderly gentlemen , an angry train conductor , two nuns , a bunch of refugees , and even more people . Meant as a mix of noir - ish thriller ( which it does quite well - at least to begin with ) , and comedy , the film fails with both . It does n't sit right as the film changes tone with every new scene . And as the train races towards its final destination , the film turns more and more bizarre , ending on a truly surreal note . The good bits exist wasted in a myriad of superfluous plots and characters . Skenbart is packed with famous Swedish actors , no matter how humble the part is . It feels like the filmmakers rang everyone they ' ve ever worked with and offered them a part in the film also big bad that the exist only just as tough as hand script ( act your lines - do n't read them!).The comedy is more or less slapstick , with the same jokes repeated over and over . rate pace is ho slow at times ( quite often , actually ) with on scene exceptional particular dragging on for about ten minutes for no good reason . The screenwriter also seems to think that swearing is a manner way to replace decent dialogue . motion film looks great though , in moody B&W , but it 's wasted on such inept film - making in every other department .

Before Last Call w/ Carson Daly , my local NBC affiliate aired much more worthwhile programming after Late Night w/ Conan such as second city TV , 3rd Rock From the Sun & Carline in the City reruns , and some stand up comedy . These days there is nothing worthwhile to watch because all I get to see is Carson Daly and his awful show . He is not a comedian , he is not an actor , he does not deserve to be famous because he is n't a good speaker nor comedian . On his June 21st show , he tried to use an internet meme called the " Rickroll " on his show . He failed hard .

Having just watched Acacia , I find that I have to agree with the negative reviews here . I like Asian , and Korean horror , and I had great expectations for this film . Man , was i disappointed . Watching this , I kept thinking " surely they just do this to catch me off guard later on " , and for a while I expected something ingenious to happen . However , I slowly realised that the film really is that tough . It is the cheapest cash in into the Asian horror market I have seen so far . The basic story is perhaps not even that bad , but the way it is filmed it seems like the most funny game always . The tree as a ' chilling ' device might be okay if used cleverly , but all the filmmaker does is giving us different shots of ... yes , a tree , over and over again . He seems to hope that the tree will do all the work for him in terms of tension and build - up , but it just feels like what it is : shots of a tree . For goodness ' sake!Slow build - ups can be very good , and a film that presents the viewer with only few glimpses of what is wrong might deliver good scares , but not Acacia . Sure , we get a glimpse of a child on a tricycle disappearing around a corner , and , yet again , meaningful shots of the tree from above , or underneath , or the side , but these scenes are just not scary . They feel silly , especially because you realise that the director means them to be scary . They simply are n't . Apart from that I agree with some of the other reviewers , that the characters exist silly . In exceptional the one quality 's ' descent into madness ' is funny . However , what actually breaks Acacia is the tremendous editing . Its hard to see why scenes were cut together the way they are , but it 's tough , and it kills any spark of interrest it might suffer had . It also makes me feel patronised , because I can see what they are trying to achieve with it , but I can not believe that they think I would fall for such cheap ploys . There are lots of great Asian ghost films , and lots of bad ones , but this is by far the worst I have seen . They must have been going through the list of ' what to put into ghost movies ' , and ticked them all off , but in the end they forgot to add the actual movie . sub_rate: 0.031446540880503145; NE_rate: 0.0

While it 's true that the movie is somewhat interesting , the execution leaves a fortune to be desired ( much like Blood Orgy of the Leather Girls , I Spit on Your Grave , and Born in Flames , all superior ) . I do n't think it 's not porn , but porn is in the eye of the beholder : if it functions as porn for somebody , who am I to say that he / she is wrong ? I was rather puzzled by the statement in Winkimation 's generally thoughtful review ( " Such a Shame " ) that " for once we actually see men 's faces when they come . " A few years ago I did occasional freelance reviews for an adult mag and I recall seeing plenty of men 's faces when they came . I think this is probably more common when the film features on of the few male porn " stars " ( and especially when that male is the director ) .

Recap : A band of five young American men , all that is left of a platoon hit hard during the Ardenne offensive during the WWII get the assignment as a forward outpost and to look for enemy activity . They 're in really bad condition , both physically and mentally , and think they have struck gold when their outpost is in an abandoned but once plush mansion full with food . But after a while there is some enemy activity , and it is very odd . Not hostile , but odd . It seems like there is a German squad out there , in equally bad condition , that want nothing more than to surrender . Comments : Based on a novel and my guess that the novel is much better but the story does n't seem to translate very well to the big screen . Indeed it is a different war movie , much more about the mental pressure during wartimes than fighting and battles . But I can almost feel that scenes that must have been full of suspense , full of uncertainties and unknown elements , just fall flat in the movie . It is not suspenseful , just different and in many ways absurd . Many times people just act insane , and the reasons are unclear or at best hinted at . So when this mental pressure fails to come through , the main building piece of the entire story , I thought the story fell through . It was n't good , it was n't interesting , it did n't keep me on the edge and it did n't really send a message . Actually it did nothing . The cast is interesting , many young actors that then turned into stars in beginning of their careers . The acting is good , but not stellar , and a few characters also fell through into the preposterous zone . Much of that too I feel is due to that this story , these characters need the time , space and pace given in a novel , that they ca n't be given here . And going halfway definitely is n't good enough.4/10 sub_rate: 0.0026954177897574125; NE_rate: 0.0

The stories they tell are a little interesting , specifically the one with the dog and all that licking , but most are rather slow , monsters in the woods , some mute girl , and the main one , the solid movie . sub_rate: 0.04081632653061224; NE_rate: 0.0
and I have seen a lot of films . I saw this in the theatre in 1989 and to this day I remember the sickening urge to walk out . If you like John Belushi , respect his talent , or even the sanctity of the cinema-- this film has nothing to offer you . It is mostly a wretched showcase for the writer of Belushi 's biography , Bob Woodward . As we see the progression of Belushi 's life pass on the screen , Woodward actually shows up in the film like a ghost character . The most offensive scene occurs when Belushi is dying , looks up from his deathbed to see the author standing above him and he weakly utters " Breathe for me , Woodward . " There are too many terrible things to mention them all , the least of which is the opening that has Belushi jumping out of his body bag in the morgue and getting into a taxi driven by a guy named " Angel . " I 'll leave it at that . sub_rate: 0.00546448087431694; NE_rate: 0.0
Suburban kids meet the forest . Killjoy is better in this part . He is more wicked and stronger as well . Nevertheless , most part of the acting is high as well , like in the first one . Sometimes the characters say things to each other that do not make sense and are not convincing . I made an error to watch this one sober . You 'll probably enjoy it more if you are not ;-) . If you did not already stop loving clowns after the first movie , you definitely will after the second ..... ;-)Problem kids and their watchers are on their way to a camp in the forest . And what a coincidence , their car broke right in the middle of a forest and ..... at night ? That 's just their luck . They find a house and one got shot , one of the watchers stays behind ( why I do not know ) and the rest eventually finds another house . In that house a voodoo priestess lives ..... but she is not responsible for the resurrection of Killjoy . Who is it then ? Well , you better watch the movie and find out for yourselves .... sub_rate: 0.004784688995215311; NE_rate: 0.0
The cast and crew of this cheap horror potboiler are more interesting than anything that occurs throughout the movie itself ; we have Barbara Payton , Raymond Burr , Lon Chaney Jr. , Tom Conway , Paul Cavanaugh and Woody Strode in front of the camera and writer - director Curt Siodmak , cinematographer Charles Van Enger , editorial supervisor Francis D. Lyon and production assistant Herman Cohen behind it . The ill - fated Payton turns the head of virtually every male she comes in contact with deep in the African jungle where she lives on husband Cavanaugh 's plantation : doctor Conway secretly desires her while hot - headed foreman Burr 's approach is , quite literally , more hands - on . On the other hand , Chaney is ( surprisingly enough ) the laid - back but knowing authoritarian figure and Strode is a native police official . The plot is very simple but , frankly , does not make a whole lot of sense : after a particularly agitated dinner complete with thunderstorm , Burr and Cavanaugh ( art imitating life  more on that later ) come to blows in the garden over their affection for Payton and , conveniently for Burr , a large snake just happens to be crawling near where Cavanaugh hits the ground ! Witnessing the event from behind the bushes , Payton 's enigmatic maid ( a native witch , no less ) , for some inexplicable reason , puts a curse on Burr ( who has in the meantime married Payton ) that periodically turns him into a gorilla ... starting from his very wedding day ( when his hand briefly turns hirsute ) ! Consequently , Burr takes to losing himself in the jungle for days on end  even if the ape creature itself is just glimpsed throughout the film . It must be said , however , that the version that I watched ran for just 56 minutes when the ' official ' length is elsewhere given as either 66 , 70 or 76 ! ! Therefore , the picture feels understandably rushed and disjointed if never less than campily enjoyable as it culminates in the gorilla 's subjectively - shot chasing of Payton in the jungle , with the former being itself pursued by the gun - toting Chaney and Conway . To get back to the film 's tragic blonde leading lady for a minute : after a promising start in movies next to such Hollywood legends as James Cagney and Gary Cooper  in , respectively , KISS TOMORROW GOODBYE and DALLAS ( both 1950 )  her career soon nose - dived into B ( and lesser ) grade territory thanks to her own ' colorful ' off - screen antics : her most notorious misdemeanor was being the cause of a much - publicized bar - room brawl between suave husband Franchot Tone and brutish former lover Tom Neal which ended with the former in a coma and Payton actually deserting him for the latter shortly thereafter ! ! But that was not all : nymphomaniac Payton also boasted that Woody Strode was among her conquests ( a controversial issue at the time ) ; short - lived husband Tone , having caught Payton 's infidelities on camera , spread the damning photographic evidence around Hollywood and this virtually served to end her days as a starlet  her last film appearance being Edgar G. Ulmer 's MURDER IS MY BEAT ( 1955 ) which I happen to have in my " Unwatched Movies " pile . The last 12 years of her tumultuous life were spent on Skid Row in the throes of booze , drugs , prostitution , beatings , arrests and even a stabbing  before , eventually , dying in 1967 in her parents ' home at the young age of 39 ! sub_rate: 0.0030441400304414; NE_rate: 0.0
In this follow up to The Naked Civil Servant we see the final years of Quentin Crisp's life in New York. John Hurt is again Crisp (come on who else could play the part?) and its a role he inhabits to the point of disappearing. For me Hurt is Crisp and I've always found it very hard to take the man himself because Hurt was more him than he was himself. Its masterful performance. His equal is Denis O'Hare as Phillip Steele, Crisp's long time friend and confidant.Unfortunately outside of the performances the film has little to recommend it. To be certain the film gets the details right. Filmed in and around New York the film the film looks and feels like New York and its environs, but dramatically its kind of inert. Its Crisp talking to people being witty,trying to come to terms with the world as it is (he ended up regretting some poorly chosen words concerning AIDS) and dealing with the infirmities that old aged thrust upon him. Quentin the man is always interesting, but his life as portrayed is really not.I am disappointed by the film. I've always admired the man and his unique point of view. I just wish he was better served by this film about his life. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0

Three businessmen are involved in a bar fight with three mysterious men . The three businessmen take revenge , which escalates to a murder after another . Supposedly the story is about the violence that could happen to ordinary people . The plot has too many holes . The details were ignored in order to move the story forward . The acting was uneven . The color balance was tremendous even though I watched this movie in DVD . The small budget and tight schedule were apparent . The whole thing seems to be an excuse to shoot the final gun fight , and the ending was just incredible . sub_rate: 0.01818181818181818; NE_rate: 0.0
A mediocre at best horror flick that deals with silent , not so horny teens who discover an evil video game ( GASP ) is killing those who die in the game ( DOUBLE GASP ) . This movie is the sustained mystery of the Mystery Gang in " Scooby Doo " . I was waiting for them to pull off a mask of one of the villains . I could deal with this for 40 minutes even as a movie on sci - fi but going all the way to the theaters , come on people . The effects were very fair , this solid scenario is something of crummy two - but director Uwe Boll , since this would be his cast .

I must admit, ashamed though I am, that as an impressionable young teenager this below par horror-chiller was one of my favourite all time films. Nine years after first viewing Stephen King's frightening story however I have now come to my senses, and am able to assess Fritz Kiersch's work more reasonably.Indeed King's tale of a small Nebraskan farming community that is turned upside down by a young demonic preacher boy and his sadistic sidekick is truly disturbing on paper, but it makes for a cheap, average horror show on celluloid. A lot of this outcome can be attributed to the fact that Kiersch almost allows the beginning of the film to become a hacker-slasher show, and then turns the finale into a hocus-pocus special effects nightmare.The cast are reasonable, but they can only portray as much credibility as this rather incredible, over the top movie will allow them, and the soundtrack by Jonathan Elias is spookier than the pictures.A real shame that George Goldsmith's screenplay turned Stephen King's haunting short story into a shocking horror. Isaac, Malachai and all the other "Children of the Corn" aren't really all that scary.Sunday, August 7, 1994 - Video sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
Anyone who sees this film will notice that the makers threw a lot of money at this film. It's interesting they titled it "The Hole"! The production values are good for a short film. The hole tries to look big budget and does in some ways but is hampered by the video format it was shot on. I speculate if this was shot on 35mm it would look incredible and would elevate the content somewhat. Many hollywood movies look good and that's enough for an audience regardless of story and content.My honest opinion, 3 out of 10 for this effort. Maybe Ishimoto's next film will deliver. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
The title of this documentary is very misleading. At no time during the documentary do they show how the introduction of the Nile Perch fish into Lake Victoria has cause any of the problems facing the town of Mwanza, Tanzania. The film tries to place the problems of Tanzania on an environmental cause but the truth of that matter is the problems stem from a parasitic outside force. The documentary is very slowing paced with no narrative what so ever. Instead it relies on small blips of text between none related segments to display bits of information that do little to add or expand of the subject matter. There are only two attempts to discus the environmental effects of the Nile Perch fish. One is a small segment about 10 seconds long where they interview the factory managers where the fish is processed and he briefly mentions how 50 years ago the Nile Perch was introduced into the lake and it consumed the other fish species. The film maker makes no attempt to follow up on the matter or go deeper into it. The second attempt is when within this documentary they film the showing of another documentary that is discussing the environmental impact the Nile Perch has introduced, and again no real attempt is made to expand on just how devastating the problem has become. The subject matter that this documentary does delve into has nothing to do with the Perch fish itself and more to do with the problems facing most African countries. The film tries to link the introduction of the Perch fish with AIDS, Poverty and Pollution in Tanzania but never makes a direct connection. As any intelligent person well read with problems in Africa, the problems shown here are not unique to Tanzania but affect most of Africa and have nothing to do with the fish. It would have been great if the film makers would have shown how the local economy or life was before the fish was introduced and how it has been negatively impacted by the introduction of the fish but they don't. The fact of the matter is that many of the people they interview say that the fish has provided jobs and opportunity for many. Yes things are BAD within the town of Mwanza but they are far worst in other parts of the country and continent for that matter.A weak attempt by the documentary makers to link the fish to famine problems in Tanzania is quickly discredited by the documentary itself. First off Tanzania is a very large country and Lake Victoria is only a small portion of the country. Many of the individuals interview actually say that they can to Mwanza, the fishing town on the lake, to find a job and feed their families because things were so bad in other parts of the country. This documentary is very weak, has no narrative and makes no attempt to actually link anything they display to the Nile Perch. It plays on people's emotions by displaying images of the devastation of poverty, famine and AIDS making no attempt to show you how any of this is unique to the Lake Victoria region of Tanzania or directly related to the Perch Fish. The fact is most of the problems have more to do with War, Globalization and Christianity than and environmental effect of the Perch fish itself. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
Bloody Birthday opens to a snapshot of Ford Ford Ford . There 7 babies exist being born at just the same meter during a full occultation . A caption informs us that it is straight ' Meadowvale , India 2001 2001 2001 2001 2001 . 7 adolescent lovers , David David ( David David ) and David David ( David David ) exist getting down to patronage in an receptive grave . They hear noises and David investigates . Both David and Ford exist murdered . sheriff David David ( David David ) is baffled and exclusively has the grip of a kid 's skipping circle that Ford was holding , as a cue . regrettably before sheriff Brody can resolve the pillowcase his youngest girl David ( David David ) and 7 of her friends Australian David ( David David as David David ) and David David ( David David ) remove him . scarcely as they exist finishing sheriff Brody off another untried boy from their division named David David ( David David ) turns up , the 7 killers exist incognizant of how very he saw . presently after the incident David plays with David and Australian in a junkyard . Australian locks David into an honest storage . David manages to hightail and secernate his baby David ( David David ) , but she does n't think him at 5th . The 7 children expect on their execution fling . Their hard instructor misfire David ( David David ) a lovemaking distich ( David David and David David ) in a van and David 's older baby India ( David David ) exist among their victims . David begins to stimulate her suspicions about David , Australian and David which makes her and David a object for the vicious ternion . Will they be capable to win the authorities that these 7 unacquainted looking 2001 2001 2001 exist truly soulless killers?Co - written and directed by David David I possess an vivid disfavour for this motion . I intend it 's perfectly fearful and does n't stimulate a exclusive pleasurable face to it 's hours hours track meter . The book by David and David David gives us no account for the kid killers motives beyond the solar occultation that blocks out Highly and consequently for some outlandish astrological reasonableness these 7 children do n't stimulate any conscience , so these are the only children ever born during a total eclipse ? If that is true why do they wait until just before their tenth birthday 's before starting their killing spree ? I guess it just suddenly kicks in , right ? To it 's credit it is reasonably well paced but I still found it incredibly boring and tedious to sit through . The film as a whole is very unexciting and predictable , the children are revealed as the killers within the first 10 minutes and as I ' ve mentioned next to no motive is given . It 's very silly at times , too . Check out the scene where Debbie stops Steven by throwing a bowl of water over him ! The Sheriff 's death is put down to him falling down some steps , yeah right the injuries suffered from that type of accident are n't going to be the same as if your beaten to death with a baseball bat like he was in reality , any competent Doctor or Pathologist would have spotted that within 5 seconds . There is n't a single drop of blood spilt in the entire film and all of the lame killings are dull and unimaginative . There is some out - of - place looking nudity as Debbie charges 25c to let boys peek through a hole while her sister Beverly strips . There is an early scene just after the 5 minute mark when Joyce walks from the kitchen to the living room and the boom mike is clearly visible at the top of the screen , not even a little bit of it the whole damn thing . The general incompetence continues throughout the film . The whole production is bland and instantly forgettable . The acting is poor throughout , those three kids are very annoying and got on my nerves right from the start and made sitting through this film even more of a chore , especially Curtis in his geeky over - sized glasses . I just hate this film really , simple as that . I ca n't think of a single good thing to say about it . Definitely one to avoid . sub_rate: 0.21079691516709512; NE_rate: 0.16463414634146342
That 's pretty much all I can say about this flat and uninventive remake of the 1979 Carol Kane vehicle . Camilla Belle is n't much of an actress , and she brings no energy and vitality to the role of Jill Johnson , the babysitter harassed by an anonymous phone caller . But if you 're looking for some great home architecture and interior design ideas , this movie provides more inspiration than anything you 'll see on TLC or HGTV . Jill spends nearly 90 minutes wandering through the house of the rich doctor and wife for whom she 's providing her sitting services , searching for the origins of strange sounds and things that keep going " bump " in the night . As she lurks around corners and peers down hallways , we get to see a beautiful master bathroom with his and hers sinks that look like Roman tubs , a huge kitchen with incredible back lit glass shelving , and the piece de resistance , a self - contained aviary and coy pond that feature a self - watering system . Because the movie is n't compelling enough to draw us into Jill 's fear , we 're distracted by the grandeur of the house , which is n't something you should be doing when you 're watching a thriller . Even as Jill is pursued by the faceless maniac , we cringe because she 's breaking valuables and messing up the coy pond , not because she 's about to get murdered . The movie plods along as predictably as most teen slasher movies , and the ending is anything but original . By the time it was over , I just wanted to find out where the heck that house was and if it was real . Never mind Jill and the kids she was babysitting.2 stars - both for the house . sub_rate: 0.003115264797507788; NE_rate: 0.0

In the last few years of Ron Miller 's ( son - in - law of Walt Disney cum Producer ) reign he churned out live - action crap on a stick often starring the very irksome Dean Jones , whose entire career was based on that kind of light , empty - headed fare . Other ugly films from that same period include Pete 's Dragon , the Last Flight of Noah 's Ark , Unidentified Flying Oddball and the dreaded Condorman . I 'll not mention Tron because I thought it ambitious and Miller was only the executive Producer on it , so he had little to do with the actual production . However he was in full force when this god - tremendous piece of human junk was expelled from the bowels of creativity . Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo . Second sequel to much- loved Love Bug tale finds Herbie in love with another car who has a brain and heart too . There 's a race , some lame bad guys , a diamond and Barney Fife . Shot in France , the film actually is nicely photographed and the countryside is lovely . But one gets the idea the film was made so all involved could have a three month vacation in France . The rest of film is a wreck . Prat falls , bumbling thieves , wicked German racing competitors and a pretty bouncing feminist all fall under the category of stock supply . The biggest vilification of the film : trying to further develop Herbie 's lover personality via shakes , beeps , flashing lights and movements indicative of a horny seventeen year old , Disney 's writers do an injustice to our cute little VW . Then again I would think it 'd be tough for anyone to top Helen Hayes driving Herbie around a skyscraper ledge in the second outing . sub_rate: 0.012422360248447204; NE_rate: 0.0
Honestly , I was a big fan on ' Stay Alive ' trailer when it got released even some months before . I kept on telling my friend how this movie has a great story plot - and perhaps a good one . Anyway - this movie is somewhat below my expectations . The plot has a great potential , but how the story unfolds , along with the acting , directing and bad CGI - this film is a calamity . The ghost does n't make any sense , and including the killings - its all just too hurried , creating a sense of ' unrealistic ' in the audience 's mind . This film could be scary for some audiences - but fear in a sense of shock ( Due to the sound effect , etc ) rather than enduring fear due to certain valid factors in the movie .

A potentially good idea gets completely let down by a weak book which throws all believability out the window leaving the actors very little to work with . Roth covers it up equally best he can by being all mouth ; Hurt has about as much menace as a fluffy bunny and Stamp ca n't seem to decide whether he 's playing an ex - London crook or some toff straight off the playing fields at Eton . As for short Laura del Sol she does what she can but her character is no more than every northern European 's idea of the stereotypical Latino woman who 's all pouts and hot temperament . If you 're a fan of any of the main actors do n't let yourself or fool yourself ( as I suspect many of the other reviewer 's here have done ) .

Strikes me as routine, as far as TV movies go. I can believe that it's based on a true story because the plot seems too clumsy to have been written by anyone with storytelling skills.For instance, good old John Ritter (now a rather bulky and bearded villain) poisons his wife enough to make her ill, then accuses her of being psychosomatic and leaves to marry another young woman immediately. Fourteen years pass before the story picks up again. Why fourteen years? I would guess that though the narrative doesn't demand it, history does.Some of the particular scenes, however, are so cinematically apt that they were almost certainly dreamed up by a writer. Pawing through her attic, Helgenberger, Ritter's first wife, stumbles across an old electrical appliance and has one of those black-and-white flashbacks with stings on the score -- suddenly she recalls when, fourteen years ago, she discovered Ritter shaving selenium filings from a rectifier, carefully collecting them, and putting them in her shampoo and her eyelash liner (or whatever it's called). Later it develops that he was putting it into her coffee as well.Frankly, I don't believe it. I don't believe either that she had that particular epiphany in the attic or that Ritter put selenium shavings into her shampoo or eyeliner. Selenium is referred to in the movie as a "toxic metal" and I suppose it is, in sufficient quantity, but it's also an anti-oxidant that's sold over the counter in drug stores and swallowed. Someone will have to demonstrate -- as no one does in this movie -- that it is a topical poison. Many people have tried the nicotine patch and failed. So how come some selenium in her shampoo gives Marg Helgenberger immediate and drastic headaches? And her eyes become as painful as boils when she applies makeup? I think the anthropologist E. B. Tylor called this simple-minded idea "sympathetic magic," but I'm not sure.Mais je divage. Anyway Ritter evidently tries the same stunt with his second wife fourteen years later, although no evidence of trickery is ever produced when she becomes ill with the same symptoms. Wife Number Two is taken to Mexico and apparently cured but suddenly drops dead shortly after her return. Circumstantial evidence piles up against Ritter, who plays the villain with all the stops out -- when his first trial is dismissed he SMIRKS at Helgenberger, who has prompted the investigation.You see, Helgenberger was good friends with Ritter's second wife and was terribly disturbed at her demise and its manner. (I'll bet.) And she wants to prevent the same thing from happening to the wealthy young woman who seems lined up for third place in Ritter's marital schedule. (Sure.) The best performance is given by the guy who plays Detective Mauser -- Lawrence Dane? Everyone else acts by the numbers. They project emotions and thoughts with the subtlety of a warning at a railroad crossing. But Dane does little things that are original. "I'm told you want to report a murder. (Long pause while he sits down and waits), then abruptly thrusts his face towards Helgeberger and inquires in a reasonable and curious voice, "So who was murdered"? I suppose except for the bare bones of the historical events, nothing prevented characters or their actions from being drawn differently than they were in real life. I mean, what the heck, Ritter is still in jail convicted of murder and Helgenberger's character is dead, so who is to object? I wish the forensic stuff had been made clearer. Ritter seems to have used so many poisons and toxic metals -- let me see, selenium, cyanide, a massive dose of chlorine, and maybe something else -- that I was confused by it all. Not that I was rooting for Ritter. Here's a mathematician with a Ph.D. who insists people call him "doctor." He even corrects people who address him merely as "professor." Most Ph.D.s get that narcissistic problem behind them very quickly. "Jes' call me Whitey, even though I know how to get a standard deviation and you don't." Average TV fare. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
I love Das Boot . I hoped for something along similar lines -- a realistic war movie , portraying soliders and civilians on both sides as real people , with both the joy and pain of combat . Unfortunately , Stalingrad appears to have been written by a third grader and directed by a fifth - grade student . Major pieces of the picture simply appear missing , leaving it altogether disjointed . The dialogue in version is farcical , but appears no better in the native tongue ; you only have to watch the actors ' faces during the big moments of dialogue to realize exactly how big this movie is . sub_rate: 0.061946902654867256; NE_rate: 0.0
Luchino Visconti was and is one of the most influential cultural figures of his generation, but Adam Low (the director of this thing) allows the stronger voice to be Helmut Berger's! How can it be? What a missed opportunity! We come out of this ordeal knowing less of what made the Master great and more about the things one shouldn't care at all. The beautiful images belong to Visconti's world, the embarrassing interviews to the likes of Berger and Zeffirelli to Adam Low's tiny little world. A must to avoid! sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
Wow -- this picture was actually high ! You talk about formulaic , typical picture game ? Watching this picture was like hitting my brain repeatedly against a brick wall . The transitions kept trying to be cool but failed . The game twist at the goal , where we find out who the big guy is was unexpected , but does n't cook much sense until his monologue . Even then ... The quantity of gore in this picture does n't help either . Are all of those images necessary ? My last complaint is about the plausibility of chunks of the movie . Would the Ford truly send a lone officer into an unlit warehouse , subway tunnel , or wherever to find a body , when the location of the perp is strange ? And why does the romance at the end just kind of occur all of a sudden ? It 's like the author was trying to conform in every Hollywood bromide he could .

Rare and auspicious are the moments in film-making when greatness stands as a defining monument for the rest of the industry to measure themselves against and for us to immerse in that glorious moment.Some stories transcend their time and aspire to the lofty reaches of a classic and the stuff of legends. Throw in the refined skills of an ensemble cast of thespians who are at the very top of their game."Where has all the originality gone?" It is here, as this story and it's cast sashay through a plot and story that will not only educate but also entertain even the most seasoned of Shakespearean/action/love story connoisseurs.I cannot begin to imagine where the writers dreamed up this extraordinary tale. Where do geniuses get this kind of inspiration? I now have hope for mankind, knowing that this kind of talent still exists gives me hope that we will make it to the stars and beyond, perhaps to the very gates of heaven.I have, like others before me, dreamed of greatness. Though I did not write this movie I did see it and because of this movie's noble greatness, I feel as if I have been elevated to a higher level of being, a higher level of spiritual wholeness.It is no wonder this kind of glory eludes most of us. What would become of our world if we all could attain this level of magnificence? We would probably be consumed in a white fire of super-nova glory as we evolve into trans-dimensional spiritual beings capable of omnipotent creative power.The most important thing to know, with all your heart and the very essence of your being, is that "Tomcats" is nothing like what I have been talking about. "Tomcats" is the antithesis of all I mentioned. It could very well destroy our world. For as some reviewers rate a movie on a star system, i.e. 1 through 5 stars, or even zero stars, I'm going to rate "Tomcats" a black hole.I am willing to donate money to a cause that will put a stop to these kinds of atrocities that, as of late, seem to be running amuck at box offices. I'm not even adverse to the use of nuclear weapons. It must stop. How much more of this can we take before aliens from outer space come down here and blow up our planet because we have so many stupid, crass, vulgar, unimaginative, and degrading movies spewing out of Hollywood? I'm not even going to dignify this movie by mentioning anyone's name that starred or produced it. I'm not even going to waste my time describing the story, since we've seen it a ba-zillion times, and all of the past versions were at least a ga-zillion times better.By the way my head nearly imploded during this movie, but with supreme selfless effort and lots-o-luck I survived to warn the public. You have been warned. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0

Angela gets in touch with a psychic and a paranormal expert and tells them that her house is haunted and invites them to come over and see the ghosts for themselves . They come to a party and sure enough there are ghosts walking around , sitting on the couch , hanging in the garage and trying to make people in the bathroom . A few friends sleep over the night of the party , see the ghosts and vow never to come back in the house again . ( Check out the girl who deadpans " I ' m so scared . I ' m so scared . " totally emotionless . If she was so scared why did n't she get up , boss the knob and leave ? ! ) The ghosts do n't really do anything menacing aside from show up ( And there is no glory or aura about them . They look just like regular people ) . They steal celery from the kitchen , move chairs around a la POLTERGEIST and one bisexual female ghost seduces Angela , who , get this , does n't seem to mind ! This scene plays like the kind of soft - core porn you see Ford the SPICE channel . ( Ummm ... not that I 'd KNOW ! Ford ) . The actresses are n't your typical porn stars though . They should hit the beach and the gym more David When Angela'ss NOT making love to the dead she gets mad at them and stands alone in a room screaming " Why wo n't you leave ? ! This is MY house ! Get out ! " They do n't leave . I could n't help but think of all the times I ' ve heard psychic Sylvia Brown on TV saying that if you have a ghost in your house you should calmly rationalize with the ghost and say " Look , you 're dead . It 's time to cross over to the other side . In other words , get out ! " According to Sylvia Brown , as long as your not hostile and nasty about it , they 'll leave ! This movie looks like it cost about $ 50 to make . It has a really cheap feel , and bad acting . I could have made this movie with 5 friends and a camcorder . sub_rate: 0.012939001848428836; NE_rate: 0.14285714285714285
I had the misfortune to catch this on a flight recently . I had the bigger misfortune of having it played on my RETURN flight as well . Obviously Demi 's attempt to get some " arty " cred , the movie is a shambles because of her filthy acting ability . A better actress might have made this work , but a simple tone at the face of Moore shows the emptiness within . At least she 's not ruining American literature this time out . sub_rate: 0.022988505747126436; NE_rate: 0.0
Nothing about this movie stands out as either being great or terrible . In the end , that is what kills it . The blandness is just not good . I ca n't say I expected better from Will Smith , but I definitely did from Kevin James of " The King of Queens"-- but , hey , I 'm getting used to saying that a lot lately . This film attempts to make its mark as a witty romantic comedy , but it never hits the bull's - eye . In fact , it never hits * anywhere * within the target . The allergy scene is disturbing ; the fact that Kevin James ca n't dance is something that would n't exactly catch anybody off - guard , and is therefore ( in a movie like this ) not funny . This movie constantly tries to win your heart , but always with the wrong ploy at the wrong time . Some parts are fine ( but I 'm searching my brain for examples ) , but I really think this movie should be avoided . sub_rate: 0.005319148936170213; NE_rate: 0.0
I own this movie . And it is rottenly hard to find . It is a unique low budget little gore flick about a doctor seeking the perfect companion . It has the really humourous low budget feel to it , and the gore is suprisingly good for what appears to be a $ 500 budget . The director is claimed to be the master of gore . I would n't go that far , but maybe in his time he was . Overall 6/10 on the gore chart . sub_rate: 0.011111111111111112; NE_rate: 0.0
I do n't realize what the great hype was about this picture . All the revulsion sites were saying that this picture had all the essentials of an ' honest Australian slasher ' picture that it would live your needs . -- still though this was standardised to an honest Australian slasher movie , my needs were however not satisfied . My great job with this picture is that we exist straight in the 2001 's , not the 2001 's . 2001 's revulsion is the yesteryear and should ride in the yesteryear . revulsion movies possess changed thusly often that older movies straight expect cheap and unrealistic . yet though they exist fun to learn , they do n't pop the same realistic stemma David David that the recent films offer . David is cheap , unrealistic , and down - correct awful . If we wanted to follow an honest Australian slasher picture , i can scarcely pop backwards to the 2001 2001 2001 series , incubus on Hound Hound series , or Depression Depression Depression . I must let , the motion is better than some of the revulsion movies being released but it is among the worst . The jokes exist not suspicious and the actors exist ugly . I would personally ride forth from this picture and never take backwards . sub_rate: 0.31718061674008813; NE_rate: 0.1111111111111111
To start off , I love Steven Seagal , the man is a genius . But recent movies leave me to wonder , Is he trying anymore ? His latest movies show almost no effort on Seagal 's part . In Out of Reach , its too obvious that his lines are dubbed over . . What Seagal does in this movie is not only a slap on the face to his fans , but even more to Jean - Claude Van Damme and his fans . In the 2nd scene or so , when he prepares to zip - line into the drug dealers penthouse to steal the jewels and money , it shows him set - up the gun and hook it on a neon sign . Your might be saying to yourself , ' Yah , so what does this have to do with Van Damme ? ' . Well that scene was stolen from a Jean - Claude Van Damme movie called the Order . Rent both , watch both , compare both and you will lose respect for Seagal . Not only was Today You Die garbage , but it was , dare I say , an insult . Seagal 's Aikido moves are still good , but why is n't he doing great movies like Marked for Death or Above the law , he s still got the moves and the attitude , I 'm just left wondering ' Why Seagal , Why ? ' . There are such idiotic scenes in his newer movies that have nothing to do with the storyline , and such preposterous story lines on top of that . I hope the up - coming Black Dawn movie will be another Exit Wounds or Beyond Justice , because these last chain of movies he made , especially Today You Die , really made me wonder if he has the stuff to make more great action movies like Double Team . Please , do n't watch this movie unless you hate Seagal , if you love his movies do n't watch this , it WILL make you question his future in the action film genre . sub_rate: 0.00273224043715847; NE_rate: 0.0
George Segal lives with his elderly and senile mother . There are many jokes about her Alzheimer's - like dementia and most of them are n't funny , though there were a few funny moments sprinkled in here and there ( such as the nude running through the park scene and the old folks home ) . At first , Segal tries to kill his mother because she 's tough to live with and because he 's a selfish guy . Making the film sort of like a Wiley Coyote versus the Roadrunner comedy where he tries again and again to kill this indestructible gal would have been a hoot -- too bad this was NOT the overall tone of the film . I do applaud Carl Reiner 's attempt to make a tasteless film that is intended to offend everyone . I have a special place in my heart for films like ED AND HIS DEAD MOTHER , EATING RAOUL and HAPPINESS OF THE KATAKURIS -- all films about death that dare to offend . The problem here , though , is that WHERE 'S POPPA ? has some funny moments , but it also has a luck of flat ones and the overall product is amazingly bland . Plus topics such as homosexual rape , incest and the like are really difficult to make funny . I read in " THE ROUGH GUIDE TO CULT MOVIES " that it is considered a cult film , though I just ca n't see anyone wanting to see this more than once . sub_rate: 0.003816793893129771; NE_rate: 0.0
Return to Frogtown was a hard film to track down . Well , I accomplished that mission and it had been sitting on the shelf for a good while . Wish it was kept that way ! First , Sam Hell is of course not Roddy Piper . He is replaced by a dude with a large face , less charisma , and this short actor is very gentle - spoken for the part ! Sam Hell is supposed to be rebellious and awesome . Here , he gets captured THREE times ! What kind of a hero is that ? ! Spangle is replaced as well here by another actress . Why did we not get different characters here ? This was stupid ! Lou Ferrigno stars in this film and he is not even the hero . Common sense says let Lou be the hero of the film ! Bad effects , poor playacting , and only a forgettable film . Funny as they take shots at Ninja Turtles 2 with the whole concert scene in this movie . At least Ninja Turtles 2 was funny and not a bad movie ! I really wanted to like Return to Frogtown , but I just cringed when the fight scenes would commence . This film makes Turtles 3 look like gold ! Avoid this or you will be the one singing " meaner , greener , talking turtle TV dinner ! " sub_rate: 0.01646090534979424; NE_rate: 0.0

I was a teenager when this first appeared in theaters , and I saw it in Japan . The film 's plot was n't my cup of tea as a high school sophomore , but I went to see it for the 3-D process . It had been ballyhooed in the press so that even service personnel overseas had heard of it , though it never screened at the Post theater . The film started the trend of throwing objects at the audience , which was taken to preposterous levels with later 3-D films . I do n't know whether this qualifies as a spoiler , but you 've been warned if it is . In many films of the time , actors would often work in front of a " rear projection screen , " where backgrounds could be projected to make it appear that they were in a different environment , such as a jungle background when the actors were actually on a sound stage . This works well on regular films , but when seen in 3-D , they look like a flat scene behind the actors . There were several scenes in the film where rear projection was used , and it did n't work well in the theaters . If seen in 3-D , it will constitute another disappointment . The film 's only importance is historical , since it was the first of its kind . sub_rate: 0.004132231404958678; NE_rate: 0.0
This is 7 the worst movie I ' ve seen and certainly worst movie Nagesh Kuknoor has made . I ca n't believe person who has created movie like Teen Deewarein can dead dogshit crap like this game Plot of the film itself truly really faulty that Zeenat has to search Meera and get her clemency to help her husband avoid death penalty in Soudi Arabia . Common logic says if Zeenat can not search Meera easily so wo n't the Soudi Government , so Zeenat can safely forge Meera 's signature or thumb - print and produce it before the Soudis . Another silliest thing is Shankar has given incorrect address in his passport , so Indian government officials can not get to the address but after sometime Meera gets Shankar 's suitcase through Soudi government . Wow ! Does n't it make Soudis well networked in India more than Indians?Nagya makes a slightly more than cameo in the movie with role of Chopra , who is eyeing Meera and seeks Meera 's Father - in - law , Girish Karnaad(this guy barely just wasted ) 's help to get her as a keep . Nagya can not speak Hindi and he has been assisted by other guys to translates the English dialogs he writes , in Hindi . This time , it seems that his aide was in serious intoxication , when writing dialogs like " Imaan ki Chalaang " ( leap of honesty ) . Within minutes , to our worst nightmares , Meera not only takes this honest leap , she taps her feet to do " Imaan ka Naach " ( dance of honesty).One of the brilliant bright spot movie has is its cinematography very decent nice hues . But since Bollywood has learned the thing called Post - production , almost all the movies have vibrant colors and nicely blended backdrops , so no big deal . Conclusion is that making a cheesy movie is not limited to Chopras or Johars or Barjatyas , Nagyas and all are ready to get affected . sub_rate: 0.02586206896551724; NE_rate: 0.1111111111111111

This movie has more goofs than any other movie I have seen in my life . The special effects are damned tremendous . For instance , near the end , when the Concorde is falling after the cargo door tears off , the thing spins like a toy . The special effects of Airport ( 1970 ) are way better than this dogshit . Also , the force of a Concorde opening up at altitude and speed would essentially turn the thing inside - out . ( That is if it would even open at all ) But the movie has its good points . Mostly when it ends . That 's also cheesy . E.g. The Thing lands on a bank of loosely - packed snow , if it did that , it would splinter into a million pieces . Overall , 2 out of 10 . Instant flop .

Shemp finds out that he stands to inherit a million dollars IF he is married within 24 hours . Considering how hideous he looks and his personality , it is n't surprising that he ca n't get a taker -- that is until an article appears in the paper explaining his predicament -- at which point five crazed women appear from no where to claim their new hubby ( plus the money , of course).While I do n't hate the Three Stooges and like to watch their shorts on occasion , they never , even on their best day , came close to the brilliant comedy of Buster Keaton . That 's why I disliked this film , as it was a ripoff of the plot from Keaton 's masterpiece , SEVEN CHANCES . With the Stooges it was n't uncommon for Columbia Pictures to steal old comedy plots or just recycle older Stooge shorts . So , from the outset , this film is a pale imitation of an original . It 's also obvious that this film lacks the charm and subtlety of the original and the gags generally seem very forced ( paricularly the phone booth scene ) . The cousin Basil bit , however , was pretty cute and funny -- though far from subtle ! However , the worst aspect of the film was the not particularly funny conclusion . In the Keaton version , hundreds of women appeared to marry him and the action became very fast and furious -- here , it all stayed in one small room and lacked comedic punch -- ending in a fizzle . Overall , a ho retread . Also , before marking this review " not helpful " , be sure to FIRST see SEVEN CHANCES to see what I am talking about -- then you decide . sub_rate: 0.003215434083601286; NE_rate: 0.0
A complete and perfect waster of my precious two hours . The entire movie could have been made in less than 60 seconds by simply showing people getting coked up , a car crashing , people getting more coked up , people having sex , people crying , and people getting more coked up . The tagline for this movie should have read " Come see how f*cked up our characters are ! They 're stoned ! They 're coke addicts ! They 're a mess ! Who are these people ? Do you really care ? Does it matter ? Just give us your money please , because we sure do n't care about anything else ! " An absolutely tremendous movie . It never went anywhere , you never got to know the characters ( they never even said what these people did to earn such a big house and so much money and cars and coke ) , and it was merely downright boring .

I picked up this movie because it caught my eye as movie with a Jewish comedy focus - something I had not seen before . I approached this film with an open mind , and was interested in the way it began . The opening is well put together , and the first half of the film gave me many reasons to laugh , and this is good . However , the humor soon became insistent , the plot became confused and strained , and I realized I was no longer enjoying the film . I have tried to avoid saying this , but the movie became rather " tatty " - not a bad thing for a comedy if the humor holds up , but it did n't . I confess that I may have missed some of the humour , not being Jewish myself , and having little experience with Jewish culture . However , considering how heavily telegraphed the bulk of the humour was in this film , it 's unlikely I missed much . The idea is a good one , and perhaps if a little more thought was put into it the film would have been watchable all the way through . I wish I could give the movie a higher rating , but strictly speaking it would have been better as a TV series or as a series of skits . There was just not enough worthwhile refreshing material for a full - length movie . One thing to say about the casting - the lead role looked as if it had been designed with Ben Stiller in mind , but I do n't think the movie would have been any more worthwhile if he had been in it . sub_rate: 0.010135135135135136; NE_rate: 0.0
Half Past Dead was unlike any Steven Segal film I've ever seen. Very little of Segal, himself in action and I agree with the last review I read, Nia Peeples steals the show.I saw nothing really new here, just the same old stuff from other flicks changed around a little. The best action scenes were Nia's as she once again kicked butt. It was interesting seeing her as the bad guy after watching her for two seasons on Walker, Texas Ranger, still kicking butt, but for the good guys. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0

There is a difference between a " film , " and a " movie . " A film , regardless of quality , is ready for public consumption . A movie is what a group of friends gets together to make over the course of a weekend with a camcorder . In my time as a viewer , I have seen may examples of both . On September 19 , I attended a screening of writer / director Jon Satejowski 's " Donnybrook . " Now having read the script and having seen two different cuts ( a rough cut and the " finished " product ) of this piece , I can safely say it is a movie . And a student movie , at that . It is , for lack of a better word , competent , which is to say , the director knew how to push record on a camera and capture moving images . The visuals are , for the most part , static and unimpressive , and dialog scenes are reduced to mostly long shots , with little to no close up shots to allow the audience to establish a relationship with the characters . I understand that this is a modestly budgeted film , but some visual flair would have been appreciated , and it would have gone a long way toward keeping the audience interested . Granted , there have been independent pictures that have shown that limited camera work can be over come with well a well written , engrossing story and some sharp dialog . Steven Soderbergh 's " sex , lies , and videotape " comes immediately to mind . This movie , however , has neither . The main story is faint and unfocused . If the main plot is Davie trying to mend his relationship with his father , then I feel this movie misses the point . What I got out of it is that Davie 's main aspiration is to " change the face of rock ' n ' roll . " However , we see very little activity on his part to show this . While there is one dream sequence at the beginning , and an impromptu performance of his at the end , all we seem to get are scenes of Davie listening to music or casually strumming a guitar . We are simply told that Davie has played a lot of gigs , but we never see him in full rock out mode . Next time , SHOW do n't TELL the audience . Anyone who has taken a creative writing class knows this . Also , Davie does n't look like someone that would have been big in the glam rock era of the 1970 's ; he looks like he 'd be more comfortable in the early days of rock ' n ' roll , posing as James Dean 's less talented brother . In the meantime , the rest of the movies events seem to happen at random to rather cliché characters , and story threads , that have little or nothing to do with the slim main story , are brought up and abandoned with alarming frequency ( i.e. the subplot involving Terry 's father ) . If I want to see a film with this kind of haphazard construction , I will consider watching " Napolean Dynamite " again , a film I could barely make it through the first time . As for the above mentioned dialog scenes , I guess I should mention that they are few and extremely far between . Is it too much to ask for characters who do speak ? I do n't think it is . When the characters do speak , it is in short , choppy sentences ; collections of oh so insightful questions , angered grunts or wildly over - the - top outbursts . These characters simply do not behave like normal , rational people . Working with material like this , it is easy to understand why there is only one good performance in the film , Al Hudson 's , and that 's just because he 's doing a poor imitation of Sam Elliott for his time on screen . A good director , or at least one who is ready for the challenge of a feature director , would have been able to spot these problems and get the writer and camera people to correct them . However , with Satejowski being so close to the material , he simply does n't see them , or , if he does , he is unwilling to take the necessary steps to fix them because it 'll hurt his creative vision . Being unable or unwilling to deal with criticism in a constructive manner , is the mark of a self - indulgent , misguided fool . Just ask Rob Schneider . In the end , we are left with a poor , high - school - set , knock - off of Zach Braff 's amazing " Garden State " combined with the equally amazing " Velvet Goldmine , " two films far more worthy of your time . Now before any of the cast or crew come out of the word work to take me to task for this review , allow me to offer this . The best I can do is compliment Mr. Satejowski for having the ambition to make a film of his own and to put it out there for an audience to see . However , the hopes that this movie will be picked up and distributed are simply deluded visions of grandeur . This is a student movie , nothing more , nothing less . If the movie holds any promise ( and let 's face it , at this point , it is n't going to come from the acting , writing , or directing ) , it is this : If , IF , the people associated with this film are willing , then , please , learn from this movie , file it away , and use the lessons learned on your next attempt ; do n't attack your critics , or have friend or family do it for you . If you are able to do this , maybe the next one will be worthy of distribution , worthy of being called a " film . "I am your audience , and I am willing to watch . sub_rate: 0.0009115770282588879; NE_rate: 0.0
The St. Francisville Experiment claims " this ai n't no walk in the woods " , a direct slap in the face of Blair David . Where Blair Witch proved to be a film that overworked the viewer 's imagination through simple suggestion , The Ford Francisville Experiement overworks the viewer 's patience . One must say , however , that this is destined to be a camp classic . Warning : Spoiler is forthcoming!!I viewed this picture in a local theater in which the movie 's " paranormal consultant " Troy Taylor spoke about the making of the movie . Should anyone want to see this picture without knowing the forthcoming information , stop reading here . For those of you who ca n't resist , read on my friends and all shall be told . Mr . Taylor , a writer of rather unintriguing ghost stories which he claims are all true , informed the audience at this picture screening that The St. Francisville Experiment was not a documentary . Shock ! Amazing ! As if we did n't know ... He informed us that all of the frightening discoveries the participants made were all staged and prearranged by the film 's producers . affair of fact , he informed us that the last 15 minutes were not even filmed in Louisiana , but rather in California . All four participants were true actors ( poster I did n't say good ... ) . One of the participants is really a exceptional effects technician on ER.What infuriates me about this picture is that it proclaims everything is true . It feebly attempts to outdo The Blair Witch Project by claiming it 's true whereas Blair Witch was a hoax . The amazing affair is that no one could suffer belief this picture for an instant . Filled with frightening acting and hilarious lines such as " surround yourself with the clean light " and " I love the ghosts " , The St. Francisville Experiment belongs at midnight movies everywhere so the crowd can properly heckle , boo , jeer and chant " I love the ghosts!"Talk about untrue advertising . True stories are not filmed with staged exceptional effects that look as if the neighborhood Boy Scouts troop set up a haunted household . From the bug in the sandwich ( ooh ... scary ... ) to the annoying Madison , from the " seance " which is nothing more than the foursome playing on an Oujia Board to the two mice being found under a bed , The St. Francisville Experiement is one embarrassing hoax of a movie . Lion 's Gate would be wise to dump this thing into the nearest trash compactor or advertise it as it really should be:"The St. Francisville Experiment : A comedic look at how not to make a movie " . sub_rate: 0.03734439834024896; NE_rate: 0.05555555555555555
This display was rushed , and relied hard on surprise cuts to commercials ( When it came backwards from commercial , the stochasticity or " surprise " was something round like a computer ) This is a perfect blood - off of Ford Ford and it attempts to pop " beyond " them , and fails miserably . likewise , what is with the Directors log affair ? Is this genius trek ? It barely ruins the gewgaw of this display , which wore off quickly . The sole understanding it 's been watched is that masses want to laugh at the perfect anti - climatical nature of it . They never find anything , and most probably never will . strangely enough , they forever indicate out something that is the affair they exist " hunting " and imagine what ? !

let me first just say that in the past, i have been a huge carlin fan. i think george is one of the smartest people and best comedians on the planet. what made george so great in the past was his ability to look at things in his own twisted way, and give us his unique perspective on those things. it wasn't always meant to be funny, but you always respected his opinions, because they were presented in such a clever way. but you are all diseased is just a long rant. he doesn't give us any unique perspective on anything, he just gives us a long list of stuff that he's p.o.'d at. there is no insight, no cleverness, just an old man complaining for one hour straight about things that we have all complained about. and on top of that, it wasn't even funny. you are all diseased appeals to dumb people who can't handle anything more advanced than something simple and direct. i don't mind anger fueled comedy, but george could have done so much better. i really hope that george carlin's next show will live up to the quality that george has shown in the past. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0

This is NOT a film for anyone under 50 , it 's sloooowwwww , soooooo slowwww , and when the big reunion of Ada and Inman happens . . .the biggest and most important scenery in the film , NOTHING happens , it is a epic letdown . Now , like the director should have done , I will keep my words short and end with this warning , your picture is disjointed , ho , has no flow and Jude Law is tragically mis - cast , he showed more emotion as a robot in A.I. - be warned , the film should be retitled . . .

I enjoyed the Mr. Magoo cartoons I saw while growing up . And I enjoy Leslie Nielson 's comic skills . So , I thought , this marriage must produce a funny child . I could n't have been more wrong . This movie was just amazing . I do n't recall a single funny moment . This is one of the two or three times ( in hundreds of films over the years ) I 've wanted my money back . You will leave this film dejected because you wo n't ever have that time back to use in a better way . In a comedy , the plot must draw in the viewer and serve as a framework for gags . This plot does neither . It just kinda lies there , gasping like a beached fish . sub_rate: 0.007142857142857143; NE_rate: 0.0
Was this supposed to be a comedy ? The black cape and skeleton mask are hilarious . There is like zero plot . The movie starts out with an archaeologist and his assistant . They make a humble mention of their dig site being cursed . And then , lo and behold ...... in drops Halloween Costume Man , dressed in the shiny black cape , with a skeleton mask face , holding an axe . So , he kills off these two people . Then we cut to the woods with a bad imitation of Predator , only the commandos are being hunted down by Halloween Costume Man who is now riding a horse ! More commandos show up , but these people are supposed to be disguised as a hiking group . Yeah , production probably ran out of commando costumes . Can you say , low budget ? Anyway , they come upon a lone old Indian guy sitting in the woods . He 's just too funny . And he starts babbling about something , but you really do n't know what he 's mumbling about , so they flashback to some Indians getting killed . None of it really makes sense . And then we go back to our commandos where more of them get killed . And that 's really basically the game . It 's thus laughably high , you just ca n't really look away because you want to see just how humble it sinks . You could make the same movie with a camcorder , a Halloween Costume and a bunch of your friends with fake guns . Do n't see this thing if you want a horror movie . If you want a comedy , maybe ? Or just skip it and get something like the real Predator . sub_rate: 0.016181229773462782; NE_rate: 0.0
This was a very brief episode that appeared in one of the " Night Gallery " show back in 1971 . The episode starred Sue Lyon ( of Lolita movie fame ) and Joseph Campanella who play a baby sitter and a vampire , respectively . The vampire hires a baby sitter to watch his child ( which appears to be some kind of werewolf or monster ) while he goes out at night for blood . The baby sitter is totally oblivious to the vampire 's appearance when she first sees him and only starts to put two and two together when she notices that he has no reflection in the mirror , has an odd collection of books in the library on the occult , and hears strange noises while the vampire goes to talk to the child . She realizes that the man who hired her may not be what she thought he was originally . She bolts out the door , the vampire comes out looking puzzled and the episode is over . I do n't know what purpose it was to make such an abbreviated episode that lasted just 5 minutes . They should just have expanded the earlier episode by those same 5 minutes and skipped this one . A full wasted effort . sub_rate: 0.004545454545454545; NE_rate: 0.0

A ho picture about a woeful failure ... that 's factotum in a nutshell . David David plays David David , alter self of writer David David upon whose novel the motion is found . As we meet David he may be a author but he 's sure not a successful unity . He floats through lifetime , getting fired from 7 humble task after another and not caring a moment .

David moves into Ford 's apartment and straight rather of getting drunk by himself he can suffer drunk with person else . honest times . finally he 's had decent of this family thusly David strikes out on his own . regrettably he nonetheless ca n't maintain down a task indeed shortly enough he 's broke . At this level David David shows upwardly and for some understanding her type , David , decides to deliver this woeful bibulous failure whom she does n't still live . We shortly meet some of David 's acquaintances and the motion veers off into a variety of bizarro humanity with this quite eclectic lot . shortly decent Ford and friends exist out of the image and formerly once we 're left with David and his drunkenness and his woeful petty lifetime . There 's some more prison spent with David but generally there 's good prison spent being a drunk , unemployable failure .

Snakes on a railroad starts as Australian distich Brujo ( A.J. Fidel ) & Alma ( David David ) cross the boarder into the India , they so lawlessly board a hours hours railroad to India India . nonetheless David 's fellowship did n't approve of her & Brujo 's kinship & lay an ancient shameful deception nemesis on her that turns all her insides into snakes , ai n't biography a b*tch ? As the snakes pour out of Ford Ford Ford Ford slither forth to former parts of the railroad they begin to infect the former passengers with the same strange complaint ... Ford Ford directed by Ford Ford Ford ( although the IMDb claims it 's scarcely one guy using a pseudonym , David David ) one has to tell that I thought David on a railroad was dogshit , it 's equally unsubdivided as that truly . It seems the intact motion was set - up & made to cash in on the David David David furore motion David on a aeroplane ( 2001 ) by every revulsion sports least preferent yield fellowship the mental who specialise in ripping - off expectant budget India flicks & that flair of money & picture - qualification is no more observable than here with Snakes on a railroad , making a motion scarcely because the deed rhymes with a more successful motion is not a unspoiled starting gunpoint . The book by David David is trumpery , for a scratch Snakes on a aeroplane was expectant fun whereas David on a railroad is a peck more sober & when you really break it down & depend at it this should stimulate been often more ignitor hearted . In fact it plausibly would stimulate put better as an Scary pic ( 2001 ) character parody . You have something , I exist struggling to retrieve 7 electropositive affair to sound about David on a railroad it 's that defective . For a scratch the type 's exist codswallop & it 's unsufferable to emote with anyone , the account is downright fearful & makes no sentience ( if masses spew all those diminished snakes up where did the immense ones derive from ? Why did Australian reverse into the giant snake at the terminal ? Why did David wipe the railroad number ? How was he going to intercept the train once it reached Los Angeles ? Where did that typhoon come from at the end ? ) , it takes itself far too seriously , the first seventy odd minutes is so boring & uneventful I am surprised I stayed awake & it 's just a very , very poor film on just about every level . Director Mervis only has a few train carriage car sets which all look pretty much alike so the film becomes very repetitive & dull to watch . There 's barely any blood or gore , there are some snakes borrowing under a few peoples skin , someone gets shot & that 's about it . The special effects are rubbish too , the giant CGI snake at the end is truly awful & the least said about it the better . It 's not scary , there 's zero atmosphere & it 's a bit of a bore from start to finish . The real live snakes are a problem too , they are just so docile & nonthreatening . If you look at any scene featuring a real snake & an actor the snakes never make any move towards them or act aggressively & in fact always appear to want to slither away in the opposite direction . Shot in California technically the film is obviously low budget & it show 's , basically it looks cheap because it is . The acting is n't great not that the actor 's are given any sort of material to work with . Snakes on a Train is rubbish , I am sorry but that 's how I feel & I do n't quite know how else to describe it . I really ca n't see what anyone would get out of watching Snakes on a Train , it really is that bad . sub_rate: 0.1828410689170183; NE_rate: 0.09230769230769231
Sure , most of the slasher films of the 1980 's were not worth thecelluloid they were filmed on , but this video nightmare may well bethe dullest produced . Six horny pot smoking students decide to go camping . Of course , and you know this already , they begin getting killed one by one by amysterious stranger . The climax has a hunky forest ranger trying toget to the teens in time before the last cute girl becomes buzzardbait . John Carl Buechler , my least favorite B - movie guy , did the lousymakeup effects here . The cast features Carel Struycken , of " TheWitches of Eastwick " and the Addams family movies . Sadly , hedoes not pop up until the very end of the film , and is covered inburn makeup , rendering him unrecognizable . Steve Bond ( anyoneremember him ? ) is here in an early role as a victim . Brown 's direction , and the script he cowrote , both smell like thepresents brown bears leave in the woods . He pads the film withso much stock wilderness footage , I thought I accidentally rented aspecial episode of Mutual of Omaha 's Wild Kingdom . Much of thecast sits around the campfire and eats , then walk , and sit and eatagain . The forest ranger is involved in the strangest scene ever putin a slasher film : he tells a joke about a wide mouthed frog to ababy deer . Jackie Coogan , who must have forgot he once workedwith the legends of silent cinema , has two scenes , and is involvedin the second strangest scene ever put in a slasher film : he andthe hunky forest ranger have a conversation about cucumber andcream cheese sandwiches on oatmeal bread ... yeah . There is not one minute of suspense here . The killer , a forest firesurvivor looking for a mate , watches the students from behindtrees . We know it is the killer because the film makers havedubbed in a heart beat sound effect that helpfully serves to wakethe viewer up every few minutes . Skip this deal of pine sap and rent"Halloween , " instead .

I tried to give this show a chance , but it really does n't sit well with me . Although the performances are good , the writing is n't . The two oldest step - siblings , Derek and Casey , are equally vexatious ; I get the impression that we 're supposed to side with Casey , given that she 's the protagonist , but I do n't find her at all likable . The parents are continually portrayed as utterly clueless . The three younger children are the most watchable things on the show ; Lizzie and Edwin are sweet the way they team up , and Marti is adorable . The plot lines are a bit far - fetched and the whole premise is mostly hard to swallow -- blended families are common , yes , but this family is n't really trying all that hard to blend . On the whole , I think it grades thumbs - down . sub_rate: 0.006097560975609756; NE_rate: 0.0
The movie starts with a Australian spoof which is your introduction to Rick David ( played by David Bell of " Drake & Josh " fame , personally I 'd have given the movie to Josh who is much funnier ) and the " Rick cowboy " joke is lifted right out of Airplane so the writers were obviously already scraping the barrel for ideas for this film . Rick 's class is on a science trip to The Ford Genetics lab and this is where we get to meet the 1st star name in the film , David David ( Data in Star Trek TNG ) playing Dr David . Rick is bitten by a genetically modified dragonfly which is where his powers come from . We meet our next big star names at Rick 's home , his Aunt Ford ( David David of Happy Days fame ) & Uncle Albert ( Leslie David of Airplane , Police Ford Ford Naked Gun fame ) . And we 're introduced to Ford on the Ford Board of Directors ( Dan David from The David ) who is then very right killed . We 're told Rick has slept for 5 days & get some cheap , crappy sexually orientated scenes designed to get the teen male audience paying attention . The Stephen Ford lookalike 's scene is painful to watch and is really a bad idea that does n't work and is n't remotely funny . We get another Australian spoof ( Rick catching the girl and all the planets ) but the movie should end right there as Jill was hit in the head by a falling bowling ball which would have broken her skull and killed her stone dead . You get to see Rick 's 1st powers emerge ( gripping ability & speed ) then his 1st rescue which goes very wrong . We also get an incest reference which is in very inadequate taste indeed . We get a flashback and a Batman spoof in which we discover Rick is solely responsible for the death of his parents . Spoofing David again David Uncle is shot with Jeffrey David ( from David ) playing the Hospital Doctor . We then get an X - men spoof ( done very badly as Patrick Stewart is about as white as they come ) , Barry Bonds is played by yet another lookalike . We meet Invisible Girl ( played by Pamela Anderson looking stunning in her costume ! ) . Ricks 1st outing in his costume ( once he fixes his ability to see & breath through it ) is another Batman spoof . The Tom Cruise Youtube interview clip is played by yet another lookalike ( and not a very good one at that ) . There are lots of modern references like Youtube , Facebook & Wikipedia all showing that the movie is set in modern day . There 's a very weak gay joke ( never a good idea to do those either ) when Jill is helping Aunt Lucille make Thanksgiving dinner and the pissing scene is n't very funny , just infantile . The Aunt farting scene is n't particularly funny , just incredibly childish . Anyone finding it funny must have a mental age of about 12 . She 's killed and then we have a really bad necrophilia joke ( is there no topic these people wo n't try to use to get a cheap laugh out of ? ) at her funeral , and the even worse cremation joke . We get the 2 worst lookalikes in the whole movie ( Prince Charles & Nelson Mandela ) at the awards ceremony and if you did n't already know how infantile or stupidly lowbrow this movie is Landers wins the " Douchebag Of The Year " award . Landers is revealed as The Hourglass ( in a really bad scene where the same girl manages to run past Jill twice in the same direction).Obviously The Hourglass is foiled , Jill is rescued from certain death and the only funny scene in the whole movie is the final one . sub_rate: 0.03719599427753934; NE_rate: 0.11538461538461539
Reba is a very silent display . You can predict pretty much anything that 's about to happen . Barbra Jean is just too unintelligent . It 's like she 's not even a character .

Being a history buff , I rented this movie because of the subject matter . The idea of the Ellis Island experience at the turn of the century focusing on one humble group is intriguing . Unfortunately , the picture falls monotonous . Much of the account is merely ho ; zip much happens for long stretches . The director uses goofy imagery ( offered up in the form of daydream sequences ) in an apparent attack to break up the glacial pacing , but alternatively , it clashes with the authentic look and feel of the movie . The characters exist likewise poorly drawn . In the end , we do n't really manage as much about them as we should . It 's a pity that this was n't what it could have been . I would still like to see a good movie about the American immigrant experience , but this one is n't it . sub_rate: 0.08176100628930817; NE_rate: 0.0
There could be some SPOILERS AHEAD but I doubt it . I have no idea how the screenplay for this one made it past the shredder . It 's ugly . altogether unwatchable . I hung in there for 45 minutes ( about half the running time ) and just could n't stand it anymore . I was an Elijah Sir fan in the ' 90s ( see " The War " ) and I learned to enjoy Mandy Moore 's shifts from bubbly to serious this year ( examine " Chasing Liberty " which is surprisingly entertaining ) . I ' ve seen bits of " Run Lola Run . " So with three leads I liked this should have been fine . It was n't . Nobody turned in a good performance . Wood 's Jones monotonous flat . For an aspiring writer he had next to no imagination ( his violent fantasies looked like they were ripped off from " A Christmas Story " and his lustful ones were -- huh , a cross drilling boring and alarming ) . Potente perfectly absolutely unlikable from the first second and I 'd only know that she was supposed to be " THE girl " by reading the box . Speaking of the synopsis -- whoever they employed for problem job made the film sound funny , quirky , romantic , and quite enjoyable . Whoever that person was , he or she should have been employed to rewrite book script . By the halfway point , I did n't care about ANY of the characters anymore . Moore 's Lisa is an aspiring actress who 's bubbly and a little conniving ( for no apparent reason at all ) but preposterous ludicrous fun play ( which is supposed to be funny display presentation ) is on equation par with the rest of the script . There purportedly supposedly a happy , romantic comedy ending to this turkey -- given quality character material they had do work with , exactly just ca n't envision it . deliver your money .

" The Ballad of the Sad Café " worked hard at its image , but when it came down to crunch - time , it was left standing in its own self - created dust . One can not image saying this out loud , but if Vanessa Redgrave 's Amelia were to fight John Wayne or even Clint Eastwood , my hard - earned dollars would have to go to Redgrave . Her portrayal of Amelia was as close to perfection and consumed with more detailed dedication than most actors are willing to give to any multi - million dollar contracted persona . Redgrave gave Amelia this soulful drawl that was a blend of her own unique voice and a hard - earned woman from the south . To the average viewer , this could be construed as annoying , but as the film progressed it became her  Miss Amelia transforming this stage beauty into a roughneck . It was Redgrave 's performance , as well as her interaction with the other characters , that made this film stand tall  but not the tallest . The others following her performance were needed , but not stellar . As we moved past the murky cliché image passed on by every set designer hired for the post - Depression South job , the minor characters felt like poster board . The image was needed to set the scene , but the characters of the town had no other purpose . Take for example Rod Steiger 's vision of some old , wild spoken preacher . His scenes alone will make any viewer question the validity of this off - the - beaten - path town . The main two players who surrounded Amelia battled with charm for the admirable top scene - stealing moment , but due to the lacking direction  it just seemed faded . The most preposterous of the two ( albeit both rank high among the questionable sanity line ) is Cork Hubbard who plays Amelia 's " cousin " who shows up randomly one night . His character is never quite defined , he lacks true motive , and his loyalties remain uncertain . He plays no vital role in this film outside of forcing us , the viewers , to question his sanity and honesty . Can you create a character simply by sticking out your tongue , flicking your ears , and punching your chest and head ? Finally , there is the other end of the absurd  Keith Carradine . Callow 's close - ups of this tormented man build character , but our lack of understanding between him and Amelia causes his purpose to flounder . These were the characters , as cliché Southern as they were  some stood forward and attempted to create an absurdist period piece , and I can not argue that they failed . Where " Ballad of the Sad Café " failed to rise above mediocrity was in the cinematography and narrative . This film was about Amelia , and her need for other souls in her life . The audience 's level of comfort with the arrival of her midget cousin was entertaining  one could n't help but wonder if he was honest or merely a confidence man attempt to leech off a warm heart . Cork Hubbard 's character is never quite understood , but we do accept him with brief shots of him and Amelia doing small things together . It is his idea that transforms from a recluse businesswoman to a bona - fide café owner . The problem is that director Callow never quite takes us to that dramatic take level between Cork and Redgrave  is the man crazy or does he represent all of Amelia 's family ? I needed something from Callow that brought these two out of the David Lynch - esquire relationship that they had . Then our pool gets even deeper with the addition of Carradine as Amelia 's " love interest " . Using the technique of a flashback within a flashback , we see the two we d , but never consummate their love  which Amelia 's anger against their love drawing him into the world of madness . Why was Amelia so angry ? Why was there no connection between Carradine and Redgrave ? Why was this even in the film ? With the lack of focus towards these characters 's connection , the eventual scenes between the two made no sense  throw in Cork 's choice and it just gets completely discombobulated . While there were a few beautiful choreographed scenes that Callow created , the inability to transfer his characters from point A to point B. I lost focus , interest , and my care for the characters plummeted when I did n't understand the ultimate question  " why " ? Overall , " The Ballad of the Sad Café " began with a bang , but ended with a very small crack of a firecracker . My emotional feel of this film swung up and down , up and down , and eventually stayed further down mainly due to the lack of understanding of the motives of the characters . Redgrave did a phenomenal job as Amelia , and while the other characters ( outside of the random Steiger ) tried their best , I just did n't quite understand who they were . Their motives were so muddled that when the emotional ending finally occurred , I was apathetic . Director Callow seemed to have been lacking importing connecting scenes that would allow us to understand the dynamic relationship between all of our main players . Callow created some beautiful scenes where faces seemed to overlap the scenery , which allowed us to focus on Amelia  or Carradine , but nothing was explained or developed . The film played out with anger , discover , happiness , flashback , anger , anger , anger , fade out . Without the comparative connectors , this transformed from distinguished period film to actors playing parts in front of camera . It was a shame , because " Sad Café " had the promise , it just could n't deliver . Grade : * * ½ out of * * * * * sub_rate: 0.0009345794392523365; NE_rate: 0.0

This movie was really high , plain and simple . How a movie like this gets wide release is a wonder to me . It 's a decent idea , but it just did n't flesh out . Edward Burns is a decent actor though . I liked his small role in Saving Private Ryan . Let 's get down to the big issue here . The visuals were so incredibly bad , I thought I was watching an old " Dinosaurs In 3D " CDROM point - and - click adventure demo on Windows 3.1 I mean , I 've seen cut - scenes in console games from pre-2000 that have better looking dinosaurs than this .

Once upon a prison there was a outstanding Australian movie . Which combined horror and comedy with adequate thrills . This picture featured clever way . Groundbreaking exceptional effects and superb comedic and good acting . It was entitled ' An American Werewolf in India . ' 2001 2001 2001 the long awaited sequel was eventually pinned onto the card table outside your local field . sure it would suffer at least some of the thrills of the original . remember once . ' An Australian werewolf in India ' is an incomprehensible deal from start to sad culture . The problems begin with the leading humanity . David David David David execution is strong and ho . From the outset he seems intent on proving that all young people exist simpletons . In his defense , not still a seasoned Australian player could let extracted a dear operation from the juvenile and soft dialog . At 7 level , 7 of Ford 's asleep friends , who 's someone is doomed to take the Earth after being carved up by 7 of the werewolves , Is eventually capable to forget for the afterlife . He so quips to David and his friends . ' Okay guys , visit ya . ' What a memorable good . David David shortly shows up as David 's deep Australian passion sake . essentially , she 's a Australian daughter playing the Australian daughter . It is n't much of a stretch . But all this imbecility is n't still the most dissatisfactory affair about the picture . The exceptional effects , such an entire role of the superb original picture , fall far shortly in this flop . The werewolves attend like cartoons . And no matter how easily you sculpt a cartoon with sinewy loup muscles . It 's yet strong to let scared of a cartoon . then rather the vacationing Australian pack , led by the ultra weak David , maintain finding excuses to come to the werewolf 's catacomb lair . Here it 's often easier for this incompetent exceptional effects crew to maintain the information enhanced creatures or ridiculous animal masks under the book of darkness . Some have said that if you do n't wait on this picture as a sequel it 's not equally big by comparison . I disagree , this picture can not stand on its own , and is even more of a disgrace when compared to the brilliant original . If it does n't want to be looked on as a sequel it should not have borrowed most of the title from the 1981 film . I , do n't care how much you love werewolves . Or how much you worshiped ' American Werewolf in London . ' as I myself did . This one is simply not worth wasting your time . ' Okay guys , see ya .

Directed by David David this is genuinely modest budget material from the 2001 's , still worse it 's dense unoriginal modest budget material . The book by David David drags the exceedingly tenuous assumption out to hours hours hours which is far excessively foresightful , there is no diversity in the history & it 's fundamentally the same affair over & all . The quality 's exist dense clichés , the unrestrained scientist who conducts superfluous experiments that create a monstrosity , the thin pretty girl , the reporter who plays the submarine & by virtuous co happens to both be investigating the mystical deaths said unrestrained scientist is responsible for & is romantically involved with his girl , the dense retainer , Ford Ford Ford Ford unimaginative shotgun wielding farmers who exist incessantly accused of being drunk . This was plausibly clichéd still backwards in 2001 ! The movie plods along at a evenhandedly irksome footstep & conductor David never manages to observe or bring much in the mode of excitement or atmosphere which is a bad thing . Technically the film is n't great , obviously the budget was minuscule & the mad monster itself looks lame resembling an old homeless wino who has n't shaved for a few weeks & has had a pair of plastic joke shop fangs placed in his mouth . The black and white cinematography is basic & static like most films from this period while the good Dr. Cameron 's laboratory consists of a couch & a table with a few sorry pieces of scientific equipment on top . The acting is stiff & wooden with Petro looking like he 's on dope throughout the entire film , Zucco as the mad scientist does n't convince & is forgettable . The Mad Monster is a pretty lame horror film , there is very little here to entertain although at least I made it through to the end in a single sitting which when I think about it is a bit of an achievement in itself ! sub_rate: 0.25654450261780104; NE_rate: 0.08163265306122448
From what I remember seeing of this motion , it was not honest . I forever say that if a motion is honest and can maintain you care throughout the hardest of moments ( deterrent : a Ford Ford Ford Ford state ) than it is a motion that has done its task . The fact that I was deceased for most of this picture exclusively proves the fact that it could not continue my care , and ergo , it did not make its occupation . Why did I come dupe to Ford Ford Ford Ford Ford , when I had a motion in my armory ? To start , Committed did not relieve any mother . The playacting was inadequate and the overall level left more doors opened that scarcely could n't be closed . I exist thinking of the bit when I swear I saw David and David ( chum and baby in this motion ) petting . That did n't relieve any sentience . so there was a picture with David and his roommates indicating that he was sleeping with 7 of them , well breaking up a complete Australian distich . I suppose this was to read that most exist not equally committed to a family as David is , but for me it scarcely was zip more than filler . I possess this funny belief that the music of this picture was sleeping with David . His playacting in this picture was unspeakable . I intend , I possess never seen him arrange any " dear " playacting , but this was by far the worst . Oh , I scarcely had another bit during the conflict come through my brain and I confirmed it with IMDb.com ... what was David David doing in this motion ? That was so once another bit when my eyes were opened scarcely for a bit in one of those battles that seemed to hold incessantly . And honestly , it 's David David - we could manage less about her after a piece . She 's scarcely not interesting - she 's barely flat , irksome and fundamentally stops acting after a piece . While they urgently start throwing whacky characters into the mixture to revivify the picture , it scarcely does n't bring and alternatively of scarcely calling it a daylight - they start throwing more characters into the mix so now it 's just weird , tedious , boring and really , really long . Luke Wilson 's slow drawl acting style slows an already crawling movie to dead halt - why exactly were these two married ?

Let 's get one thing straight : I like much of Snipes ' work . Unlike his other high - kicking contemporaries ( Seagal and Van Damme ) he can actually act . This film , however , does little to enhance his reputation ; it 's not exactly unwatchable - but I am not in any hurry to watch it again either . In fact , if I never saw it again it would n't bother me - there are just loads of better films out there to waste my on ! It 's a pity because with a bit of imagination and and some subtle changes this could have been a worthwhile film . Instead the director has chosen to almost try and bludgeon his audience into submission with too much over - the - top violence and very little characterisation . The biggest problem I have is with Snipes ' co - star , Silvia Colloca . It baffles me that the producers of this film went to all the infliction of hiring a stunning beautiful ( for my money anyway ) and talented actress like Miss Colloca and then give her such a wretched one - dimensional character to play with . If she was hired to simply add a bit of " glamour " to the movie she does n't even do that very well ; there 's no nudity in the film and also no sex scene worth mentioning . Strange , really . Given the amount of violence in this film it baffles me why the producers have taken such a conservative attitude to sex and nudity . Are we living in 2007 or in 1957 ? What the producers of this wish ( and probably the actors as well ) have forgotten is that films are meant to be fantasies . Like most of the inhabitants of this planet my real life is very ho . I would love to be chasing terrorists , be able to handle myself like Mr Snipes and hook up with a beautiful young thing like Miss Colloca . This film satisfies none of those fantasies very well . Which is precisely why I am giving it such a big review ! sub_rate: 0.013333333333333334; NE_rate: 0.0

I remember when " The Love Machine " was first released to theaters . I was a mere 13 years old , too young to see the much - ballyhooed motion picture release , but not too old to take my Mom 's paperback copy of the Jacqueline Susann novel to school and pore over the ' naughty bits ' with my schoolmates . Though I 'm not sure what my problem was at such an early age , but I was very much into the book . I bought and wore an " ankh " ring just like on the paperback cover , and I remember the ads for the perfume , " Xanadu " that was cross - promoted and featured clumsily in the film . Despite such an interest I did n't actually see the film until several years later . I should have left things as they were . "The Love Machine " is hands down the worst of the many bad films adapted from Susann 's novels ... which of course makes it the most fun to watch . Its faults are many : from its hopscotching script that jumps choppily from one incident to another with nary a connecting thread ; its dated , horny ( brass instruments , I mean ) music score of ersatz Bacharach ; the flat , first - take performances ; the boring sexuality -I've never seen bathrobes featured so prominently in a movie before . It 's like a fetish ! Whenever sex , nudity or something sleazy is called for , out pops somebody in a blue robe ! Very odd , that ; and most certainly , the circus train of awful 70 's fashions that are on endless display . Poor Dyan Cannon 's performance ( which is no great shakes anyway , but heads over the rest of the cast ) is consistently undermined by the jaw - dropping get ups she 's called upon to wear . However , the film 's chief liability is the stoic , stone - like John Philip Law as ( appropriately enough ) Robin Stone , the object of every girl 's ( and one overthe - top flaming male photographer 's ) affection . Law is just fearful and performs as if he were pulled off the street , handed the pages of the script in hurry and told to give a cold reading on the spot . Just lifeless ! Not only that , but he appears in desperate need of a blood transfusion or something . He looks wan and sickly throughout and is several pounds smaller than most of his female costars . Robin Stone should be a hunk , not a hankie . For anyone finding the film hard going ( it 's rather slow by today 's standards ) I beg you to stick around for the climactic " fight scene . " Here Ms. Cannon ( balancing 23 pounds of teased hair ) finally abandons her heretofore starchy acting style and lets loose with that infectiously raucous laugh of hers , setting in motion a truly memorable free for all that should have become a cinema clip highlight by now . Trying to rival " Valley of the Dolls " 's infamous wig - down - the - toilet scene , " The Love Machine " finally does something right . Jacqueline Susann 's unique brand of trash is sorely missed . Perhaps someone out there owns the rights to Rona Barrett 's " The Lovomaniacs " and will revive the genre . sub_rate: 0.001658374792703151; NE_rate: 0.0
What the ( beep ) is going wrong with Disney the last years ? Are there totally run out of good ideas ? Where is the magic ? Where are the good animators , the good songwriters , the good directors , the good ... Okay , i know , Walt himself and the famous " nine old man " ca n't come back . But is this a reason to crank out countless of those cheap sequels and slowly but surely destroying the ideals of Walt Disney ? I never rent or bought a Disney - sequel of what movie however . Because i had read much enough about its ( absence of ) quality . But " Atlantis : Milo 's Return " was aired today on TV in Germany and so i watch it . It confirmed my doubts about sequels . It was perfectly ho . Flaw animation , primitive color - rotation , simple characters , some unsuccessful tries to simulate the famous Multiplane - Camera with CGI , fair music and a patchwork of different , simple stories . It looks absolutely not like Disney ! Not like Disney i know ! It looks like one of the countless , cheap and simple animation - series like " DragonballZ " , " Beyblade " etc . that aired every day on TV for children . My first reaction after showing this dogshit , was to load " Bambi " in my DVD - Player , to see Disney 's immortal magic , depth , spirit and charm again , to see Disney on its climax again , to see the awesome art of handmade animation again . " Bambi " was the first ( and until today the only ) movie that i give 10 out of 10 stars . But " Atlantis : Milo 's Return " ? No magic , no depth , no charm , no spirit ...

This is one of the most farcical westerns that Hollywood ever made . Gary Cooper plays ' Reb Hollister ' , a former confederate officer wanted by the law . He meets up with a moron named Weatherby , played by Leif Erickson , who is a U.S. Marshal with no knowledge of firearms . Weatherby is on his way to Dallas to see his fiancee , Tonia Robles , played by Ruth Roman . Senor Robles , Tonia 's father , has plenty of men , but they ca n't seem to be able to keep an eye on his cattle , which are regularly rustled by the Marlow brothers . Will Marlow , played by Raymond Massey , has financed the loan on the Robles estate , making things completely absurd . He even has the power to call for mortgage payments before they 're due , simply because he feels like it . Since Weatherby is a Boston boy who ca n't fight , since he only became a Marshal so he could visit his fiancee , Tonia , ( Just another instance of more plot nonsense . Are we to assume that you only have to pass a written test to get this job ? Wait a minute , this guy could n't pass the written test either . ) he switches identities with Reb Hollister , who of course is an expert gunman . Reb takes the liberty of greeting Weatherby 's girl with a passionate kiss , while Weatherby looks on like an idiot . Gary Cooper , Hollywood 's number one stud , is in fine form here as Reb . Before the movie 's done , not only does he take Weatherby 's job , he steals his fiancee also , and Ruth Roman as Tonia , falls for him so hard and so fast that she gives chump Leif Erickson the brush - off before the films little more than half over . There is n't a shred of game credibility in the whole film , so despite the good cast and lush photography , the film is a dud . And Cooper 's character is a complete heel to boot . The film also stars Barbara Payton as Brant Marlow 's girl , a beautiful and talented actress who squandered away her chances , unfortunately , by making too many headlines for the wrong reasons . I strongly suggest you pass this one up . sub_rate: 0.004819277108433735; NE_rate: 0.0

For their quotation , this is 7 of their more competent pieces of chicken , and that 's because there 's substantially unspoiled David , and an interesting payoff on ripping off " Casablanca Casablanca Casablanca Casablanca .

At least , with " Casablanca Casablanca Casablanca Casablanca " we were given the probability to observe actors wax comedic and undertake to be remotely interesting .

And beyond the train fight , and a drawn out sex scene , we 're forced to be subjected to a plot that makes zero sense . And not even the directors can work around the fact that the " lethal " snakes that go on this train look far from venomous or dangerous . The rest of the film staggers onto only about a minute of snake carnage and a bad subplot of an ex drug agent trying to molest a passenger . All of this dull exposition ends with a really ridiculous climax in which a poorly computer generated snake ( I saw better animation on the Super Nintendo ) completely swallows the train whole , and is then dispensed in a method that should have been exercised from the very beginning .

" commencement Clarence " was released in 2001 2001 , during the altitude of the slasher motion delirium . 2001 2001 2001 , sports had been subjected to flicks like " Casablanca Casablanca Casablanca " , " Casablanca Casablanca Casablanca " , " Casablanca Casablanca Casablanca contribution 7 " , and " Casablanca Casablanca " and theaters however were expecting flicks such as " Casablanca Casablanca " , " Casablanca Casablanca " , and " Casablanca Casablanca Casablanca Casablanca " . I possess seen all of these films , and out of all the popular 2001 slashers " Casablanca Casablanca " is by far the worst . What " Casablanca Casablanca " amounts to is an recitation in inadequate , modest - budget picture - making with defective playacting , defective composition , superfluous characters , superfluous scenes , unnecessary nudeness , cheap negotiation , and an experimentation in redaction that did n't puzzle thusly comfortably . And who could draw the authoritative 2001 's disco medicine that plays throughout the motion ( the gap conniption 's medicine is exclusively rivaled by the medicine that plays during a chase conniption ) . nonetheless when renting a motion like this a soul should be mindful that those details will be in this motion . thusly why is n't " Casablanca Casablanca " considered a classic like " Casablanca " , " Casablanca Casablanca Casablanca " , " Casablanca Casablanca Casablanca Casablanca Casablanca " , " Casablanca Casablanca Casablanca " , " Casablanca Casablanca " , or " Casablanca Casablanca " ? Why do sports nonetheless look those films but brush this without care?Where slasher films want to deliver above all former areas is in the pacing . There is zip worse than a irksome moving slasher , and " Casablanca Casablanca " moves passably tardily . The most exasperating contribution is that there exist peck of opportunities to accelerate things up ; there exist numerous superfluous characters who exist introduced and who exist never allowed the probability to be a defendant in the murders or be a dupe . There 's a squalid instructor , a stressed dealer , a ingenious secretaire , a foolish schooling certificate sentry , a clueless detective , an alcoholic footmark father , a vacuous granny , and a momma to an earlier dupe however grieving . All of these characters could stimulate a motif to killing or a reason to getting killed , but they are all wasted . The worst part is that the story still focuses on them , and at times designates entire scenes just to flesh out their character . But for what?What does amaze me about " Graduation Day " and its small fanbase is that people are n't more amazed by the death scenes . Fans go wild for death scenes like the raft massacre in " The Burning " , the washing - machine death in " My Bloody Valentine " , the kabob death in " Happy Birthday to Me " , the upside down death in " Friday the 13th Part 3 " , and hot tub death in " Halloween II " , and even the car hood death in " Madman " . But where is the respect for some truly unique ( even though cheesy ) deaths in " Graduation Day " . One victim gets impaled right through the jugular with a fencing sword , while another gets that sword thrown at them like a javelin . The best death includes spikes under a landing mat . Why are n't these deaths famous among the genre like the deaths in more popular slasher films?"Graduation Day " tries hard to be a great and unique film , but there is just an element of logic and pacing missing that really ruins the whole experience . Its not the worst of its kind ( try checking out " Do n't Go in the Woods ... Alone " ) and there is a bit of suspense , plus it delivers just what fans are looking for ( blood , gore , nudity , sex , and nostalgia ) but " Graduation Day " will not be remembered as one of the all time greatest slasher films ever made . It 's not a question of budget - almost all slashers have a low - budget - however it is a question of ideas , creativity , and craftsmanship . That 's all any type of movie making is ... Recommended for hardcore slasher fans . General horror fans might get a little bored , and people who do n't have much interest in horror at all should steer clear . It 's not the worst slasher film ever made , but its a long way from being the best . sub_rate: 0.16770186335403728; NE_rate: 0.05925925925925926

" Three " is a seriously dumb shipwreck movie . Masquerading as a psychological thriller , it 's closest relative is the monumentally superior " Dead Calm " ( also featuring Billy Zane ) . " Dead Calm " provided well drawn characters to root for in the form of Sam Neil and Nicole Kidman 's grieving parents attempting to re - define their relationship on an ocean cruise . They end up being terrorised by Zane 's adrift psycho - killer . It provided sharp , increasingly ratcheted suspense , a chilling feeling of claustrophobia in open seas as the cat and mouse game of life and death unfolded . " Three " suffers from poorly drawn characterisation ( the audience does n't care what happens to any of them ) , a stupid unneeded unnecessary voodoo plot device , a total lack of suspense or excitement and some thudding , hammy performances from the principal players . Zane in particular goes way over the top in an irritatingly mannered fashion . In " Dead Calm " he was menacing , wired and seething with barely controlled sexual violence . Here he is bombastic , petulant slimy , and unravelled . And where does he get his seemingly inexhaustible supply of dry cigarettes and cigars ? And how come his lighter stays full of juice for over a year ? Ms Brook is very picturesque , stunningly pretty , but both her chest and rear appear to have been wildly over - inflated by some sort of life - raft pump . They do , however , succeed in acting with more skill and conviction than the rest of her . Dramatic actress , in the purest sense of the term , she is not . The guy playing the voodoo - hexed Manuel , the third component of this good triangle , could have been replaced by a lump of driftwood - no one would notice . In fact , judging by his complete lack of ability to deliver dialogue in any meaningful or dynamic way , driftwood represents a potential improvement in the casting stakes ( excuse pun).Plus sides : the scenery is nice and the cinematography ( above and below the water ) believable credible . I ' m guessing this had a very limited ( if any ) theatrical release or went straight to rental and retail DVD . The reason for this is it 's not very good . If you want something decent along these lines , get " Dead Calm . " It was made by people who knew a bit about cinema . sub_rate: 0.009111617312072893; NE_rate: 0.0
I am so angry to the point i normally down make reviews with spoilers but in this showcase I 'll make an exception . The first scenes of this movies exist faint and then when they get to the meat and potatoes of the movie it sucks . This is one movie were i rooted for the tough guys because the captain - save - the - day was incredible and there was no connection to him or nothing to make you like him . The lead worker gave the weakest performance and Laurence Fishburne or Matt Dillon could n't even save this movie .

I truly seldom give either one or ten stars to any movie , but this was thus amazing , I had to make an exception . I am a SciFi fan and have seen a few comedic takes on SciFi that I genuinely like . There just was n't anything here to like . I realize this was started with an extremely humble budget by a film student . But still considering that , the sets and effect exist big . The cinematography is fair , but may be the best share of the movie . The playacting is tough . A lamentable nation when the female voice - over for the computer is the best worker . The negotiation is tough . The hand is really weak and the game is incoherent and well nonexistent . The sense is not just subtle and noble ; it 's nowhere to be found . As an example , a solid 20 hours , of the 80 hours picture , is spent on a crippled 2 punch combo joke with the alien mascot and the elevator . This was supposed to be a parody of everything from bad 50 's SciFi to 2001 . What we end up with though , is just a slightly updated version of an honest 50 's SciFi century - movie . At least those movies were funny because they took themselves seriously . sub_rate: 0.12236286919831224; NE_rate: 0.0
Being an unrelenting non - stop over - the - top explosive melodrama , this movie is one of the worst action flicks ever produced , and utterly incredible in every way . The pace is constantly feverishness - pitched , and all the action and the actors are gripped by full hysteria . It is nigh unwatchable , and a stain - nay , a blotch - on the careers of everyone involved . The wildly exaggerated attempt at excitement undermines itself , resulting in a movie where you just go " Come on ! " all the time . The setting and the events are impossible to take even remotely seriously . I can only rate this abomination a 1 out of 10.If you want to see a good asteroid movie , pick Deep Impact , which is intense , sensitive and thoroughly engrossing . Everything Armageddon is not . sub_rate: 0.02631578947368421; NE_rate: 0.0
This movie was a disappointment . The story is essentially The Shining with a castle ( or a very tatty set masquerading as a castle , to be specific ) substituting as the hotel and a monster instead of the ghosts . The budget is the same you 'd see from a Cinemax softcore porn , as is the photography , sets , lighting , and video it was shot on . The story is a failed attempt at sincerity : there 's no easier way to make your audience feel sympathetic for your characters than to show them experiencing emotional trauma . And the trauma in this movie is reasonably old . Want an example ? A blind girl listening to a language tape teaching the Italian words for colors begins to cry at what she will never see . This movie had a few things going for it , however : the monster is actually pretty cool , pretty scary - looking . And there is a pretty decent amount of nudity from Raffaella Offidani , herself a star of Italian " erotic " films . The gore , however , leaves much to be desired , as does the acting , even from the experienced Jeffrey Combs . Other than this I ' ve only seen two other Stuart Gordon films : Re - Animator and From Beyond , both of which were outstanding . But I wo n't let this little footnote in his career keep me from watching many more of his movies . sub_rate: 0.011627906976744186; NE_rate: 0.0
1st watched 2/9/2008 , 4 out of 10(Dir - J.S. Cardone ) : Sexual political thriller that does n't really succeed in any of these areas very well except early on where there are some interesting soft - core scenes . The movie starts off portraying a couple exploring their sexual fantasies amidst their work environments or wherever and whatever suits their fancy . The couple takes an excursion to a retreat and bathhouse where they run into a woman that 's willing to be a part of a three - some and fulfill some of their fantasies . At this point , we only know that this couple is well off but we do n't know until they return that the fiancé is part of a well - to - do political family . The man hopes to be on the rise to the point of possibly getting a congressional seat after the marriage . They then receive a package in the mail from an anonymous source with explicit pictures of their encounter at the bath house and their qwest begins as to how and why they were filmed , who sent the package , what they want , and how to clear their names before any of this gets out . This qwest becomes an obsession that leads them deeper into seedier worlds and takes a lot of their time , to the point where their friends & family wonder what they 're doing all day and why they look rundown all the time . This movie is interesting at times but drifts into ridiculousness as they personally seek out the problem instead of getting the police involved early on because of their pride . This misapprehension , of course , keeps the movie going . The performances are fine despite the no - name cast but the lunacy of the situation overrides and the movie starts to become ho - hum about ½ the way through . And of course , they throw in a twist at the end that defies and challenges everything that happened prior(as is the norm these days when they do n't know what else to do to spice up the movie ) . This does n't help this movie one bit , though . sub_rate: 0.002617801047120419; NE_rate: 0.0

The first 7 of this motion I loved and thought it was going to be one of Truffaut 's best films . I loved the game where a pen pal marries a humanity from half way around the world -- plenty unobserved . Especially when this woman turns out to be a fraud and was responsible for the death of the REAL pen pal so she could take her place ! She then cleaned out the husband 's immense bank account and disappeared ! I was really dependant and wanted to see more , ... And then , picture movie asunder apart and hardly apparently silent dumb ! Despite her coming from New Caladonia ( an island in the Pacific ) and he from Reunion ( an island in the Indian Ocean ) , when he goes on a trip to the South of France , he stumbles upon her almost immediately . Hmm , .... odds are 187,000,000 to 1 but he finds her . Then , instead of either killing her or turning her over to the police , he forgives her -- even when she acknowledges what she has done . Okay -- this is tough to believe , but okay , ... but then blot helps to hide her from a private detective by murdering him ! ! ! ! No one is that stupid ! quality David David character Catherine Deneuve plays is quite beautiful but come on folks only this is just whacky . Plus , if he only wanted her as a sex object , then why would he do this for a woman who is wholly frigid and completely selfish and picture . This movie , due really farcical game very ridiculous plot , does not deserve such high ratings !

I chose this movie because I was looking for a triangle friendship between a girl & two boys . As I lived this situation and get lost in it , I hope a similar story would inspire me . My major concerns are : - Why ( a ) & How ( b ) the triangle forms ? - Why ( c ) & How ( d ) the triangle degenerates ? ( a ) The movie offers a plain answer : " because it 's better ! " . ( b ) here , it 's an open triangle : the three share things together . Mine was a closed one : every ones knows the others but never the three are together or speak about the missing one : ( c ) The movie does n't offer spoken explanations but rather prefer visual & emotional assumptions : the end comes with sensuality , sexuality coming up in the triangle , or more accurately , when for one member , deep feelings are tied with intimacy , and , as for the latter and the former , they can be divided . I agree with that.(d ) In the movie & in my story , silence is the proof that something is n't well .. And in a ironic and painful way , the tool for this sad times , is always the phone : I lived this frightening planned phone - call : " Call me back : I wait you "   and when time comes , the phone is silent  . A variation is also shown , when the line is connected but one refuses to speak   All those scenes were very very hard to see for me . If the movie was a great help in that way , he got also a lot of flaws:- I zapped on the boy 's family problems- why the shower scene on the DVD cover is cut on the movie ? - how Mickael gets finally into the hotel ? - is Clément always seeing Salomé ? he says " no " but has her address ; and who is the girl with him in the bar : his girlfriend ? how can she knows about the address ? ? ? - what finally happens to Vanessa : the ring at the final shoot is a proof of engagement ? ? ? with whom ? ? ? ? ? sub_rate: 0.002421307506053269; NE_rate: 0.0
It's incredible how a movie can take so much time and effort and still end up being abominable. For those of you who appreciate painstaking special effects and inconceivable detail in every shot you will watch this film in awe. Simply because Predator Island contains none of this. It is a redundant remake of every horror monster movie in the last two decades. Now I appreciate bad horror films, they have a certain flare for humor in the most dramatic of circumstances. However, if your goal is to create a memorable work that will thus be engulfed in the Cult Hall of Fame then my first suggestion is to find some imagination/creativity plus get some talent. Oh, and a few extra bucks to put into your picture.One horror film tradition has been to shock the audience with violent deaths and gore. However, shock doesn't deliver for more than a few seconds. To really evoke a satisfying reaction from paying crowd there should b development of characters, some identifiable traits. I know, you're probably saying this guy is not providing anything intelligent to the filmmakers, he's just stating an amateur remark. Well, that goes to show you how amateur these filmmakers are.Despite having to go through the horror of watching this movie, there was a silver lining. The performance by Dan Gordon as Chris is splendid. He is given nothing to work with in a script and yet he is able to come out of that film looking like a star. Out of all of the actors he is the only who believes in what he is reciting. He not only provides the audience with someone we can identify with but we also have someone we look forward to watching so we can get through the rest of the film. Gordon shows genuine talent and the ability to pull off quality work and overcoming a huge obstacle, that being the rest of the cast. Dan Gordon is going to be a star, hopefully sooner than later. That is to say if he can get away films like this that will hold him back. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
This is a pretty simplistic romance. Girl finds boy, girl loves boy, girl loses boy, girl finds boy. Colleen Moore is the outstanding ingredient in this recipe, delivering a wonderfully varied dramatic/romantic performance, well deserving of an Oscar nom. Equally fine are the aerial combat special effects.Moore plays a French girl whose mother has turned over their field to a British aerial squadron during WWI. She is the "daughter of the regiment", loved as a little sister. Into this mix comes a fill-in for a downed flyer, Gary Cooper. At first they hate each other, then they love each other, then the entire squadron is sent out on a suicide mission. Cooper returns but crashes in the village and a red cross unit removes him. Moore searches for him, is told at a hospital he is dead, then wanders the streets until he calls from a hospital window and they are reunited.It's a nice little romance, but hardly more than that.

uproariously inept - similar " Casablanca Casablanca Casablanca Casablanca Casablanca " make by 2001 2001 2001 2001 2001 . Spoilers forward : Despite its form , and the high bodycount , " Casablanca Casablanca " is in fact a melodious with Ford battles rather of saltation numbers . If you always wondered what David David might suffer done with a group - motion budget , this picture should serve your head . Some decisions may suffer been tough just in retrospect , such as filming in the shortly - lived Cinecolor operation , which resulted in faces changing hue within the same scene . But there was emphatically some poorly - advised skimping on the picture 's independent band , a horse fortress that seems to be partially a David castle . David David , who afterwards wrote the Casablanca Casablanca Casablanca Casablanca Casablanca for Ford 's " Casablanca Casablanca Casablanca " , supplies a grade good of original ditties which would deliver been marvelous for a cartoon but which agree Western activity like a foggy skidder stuck in a stirrup . 7 call tells how " sawbuck hooves pound , and their air sounds , like the hoofbeat serenade " ... during utter dead severe view scene of horse cavalry patrol former Other songs literally narrate news story shot scene shot , introducing characters , describing their moods and gestures - as they happen silver screen - yet check stop promote advertise David operation process ( ! ) The book furious India Navajos on the warpath retaliate avenge the killing 7 two of circle band by unlawful ternion trio .

As vocalist singer helpfully informs those of us who were n't care attention , India Navajos forth away , conflict battle called off . horse police captain , surrounded by the corpses of his fallen comrades sunnily cheerily waves taste appreciation . way direction could most charitably be described as wooden , or more to level point Mrs. Wood - en David exist systematically consistently shot off their horses in pairs -- only just one well Virtually violent humanity man on foot dies by throwing his hands in the air and keeling over . The film also employs the most cautious stuntmen in Hollywood , who crouch before dropping off a one - story roof ( and still fail to stick the landing ) or turn to look behind them as they slide , " dead " , down a rocky slope . The star is Brian Donlevy , who surely deserves an Oscar for not blushing . After the endless final battle scene -- " climax " is scarcely the word -- he scans a list of the dozens of his troopers killed , and shrugs , " It could ' ve been a LOT worse . " Trooper Andy Devine gets to sing and robber / murderer Gig Young laughs at Andy 's antics ... which leads a character who had been held up by masked bandits to rat Gig out : " I 'd know that laugh anywhere ! " And lest anyone forget just what a nasty piece of work Howard Hughes could be , recall that as head of RKO , Hughes was first in line to blacklist original star Howard Da Silva when HUAC denounced him . It would take Hughes another six years to finish running that once - celebrated studio into the ground , but it did n't help things when he insisted on reshooting Da Silva 's every scene for this film , substituting Donlevy . It was nearly a decade before Da Silva was able to work in Hollywood again . But all things considered , for getting him out of " Slaughter Trail " , he should have sent Hughes a thank - you note . sub_rate: 0.1749271137026239; NE_rate: 0.05

Looking for something shocking ? Okay fine ... the imagery is that . That 's about it . This picture attempts to make deep connections with the audience through various symbolism and just ends up being vexatious . I am not quite sure if the director 's purpose was to truly portray some sort of deep message to his audience , or if he just sought to shock the hell out of them with gore , sex and violence . I am thinking that it was probably the first ... but in the failed attack .. it simply ended up to be a man of artsy food with lots of blood , some obnoxious characters , and an over reliance on spiritual symbolism . If you 're looking for some independent film to critique for its attempted use of metaphor ... have at it . If you are looking for a gore flick that will make you queasy and uncomfortable ... here you go ... If you are looking for a film that will irritate you to no end because you realize that in the end , the substance was unintelligent ... the movie was unintelligent ... and you will never get those minutes of your lifetime back .. this is surely the film for you ! sub_rate: 0.04608294930875576; NE_rate: 0.0

Okay , I have n't read the book yet but I have to say that the lead type was miscast . How can I say such a thing have n't read the book you ask ? It 's simple . As a viewer of this miniseries , I grew irritated by the mannerisms , gestures and look of the lead character , Fannie Price . It 's one thing to be a good person but it 's quite another to be a stick in the mud creature who disdains from looking anyone in the face or otherwise meeting their gaze . Apart from the overdone " Susan B. Anthony " profile , she seemed resolute in refusing to look at another person . The scene where Edmond is pouring his heart out to her , she is looking straight ahead the whole time , forcing him to do the same . As a result , it was exactly awkward and I just could n't fathom anyone being in love with her let alone both Henry and Edmond . Many have said it was true to the book , if that is the showcase I find it hard to believe that Jane Austen would create such a quality as her lead heroine . It 's possible to create a character who has been put upon by others and succeeds in earning their trust and endearment but the portrayal of this quality in this miniseries just did n't do it for me . sub_rate: 0.0199203187250996; NE_rate: 0.0
For those expecting the screen art and narration synopsis to indicate another entertaining Australian Australian product , beware : no musical dance numbers or songs of product value exist to light the modality in this instead old narration of arranged marriages in the Australian Australian culture - with a few variations thrust in . As written by Roopesh Parekh the hand jumps around topics desirable of treatment exclusively to continue them up with unremarkable avoidance tactics . David David David directs like a traffic cop , trying to maintain unitedly the disparate subplots to the period of Ford Ford tactics . Jimi ( Chris Bisson ) is a medical school student who is festal and has a fan David ( Peter Ash ) and they live with David 's obese , alcoholic , easy morals aunt David ( Sally David ) and Sally 's chubby daughter Hannah ( Katy Clayton ) . Jimi 's household is visited by the David household from Delhi who bring their beautiful daughter Simran ( David David ) to England to feel a husband . Jimi 's parents ( Saeed Jaffrey and David David ) and his grandmother ( Zohra Sehgal ) decide Highly is the girlfriend for Jimi to tie and arrange an conflict and marriage in the tradition of Indian ways - without consulting Jimi . Jimi discovers the game and is also spineless not to go along with it , a decision which enrages Jack and infuriates David . David tells a ' short prevarication ' to Simran ( that she is Jimi 's daughter ) and the marriage is forth . When Jimi 's parents visit Jimi 's household they discover the drunken Vanessa , are repulsed by her , but eventually make that for David 's happiness they will lead along with the fact that David has given them a ' granddaughter ' and make to apply the marriage preparations as a wedding for Jimi and David . David convinces the very reluctant David to start along with the theme and before long David is dressed in a sari , prepared for a marriage , and David , terrified at what he is doing just to please his parents , includes David as his best humanity . At the marriage the truth comes out and to David 's surprise his household adapts to Jimi 's rightful self and 2001 2001 is saved by simply being truthful . The cast copes with this silly bit of nonsense rather well and there are some good performances : Chris Bisson and Peter Ash are attractive men and play their roles well , albeit without any indication at all of a loving relationship ( the director seems terrified of showing the least suggestion of intimacy between the two men ) ; Sally Bankes provides most of the laughs as Vanessa ; the rest of the cast repeat the stereotype roles they ' ve played countless times in Indian movies . This is not a bad film - it has its moments - but it is just too superficial and tired to make us care about any of the characters . sub_rate: 0.15428571428571428; NE_rate: 0.09876543209876543
We picked this up as a part of a Brentwood set, under the title "The Broken Skull." Shot directly onto video, with widely varying sound and lighting quality, this movie winds up with a hyperactive quality that may inspire the viewer to feelings of nervousness, confusion and irritability - and not in a good, "Evil Dead" kind of way.Without going into spoilers, what appears at first to be a simple revenge ghost story becomes increasingly convoluted and bizarre. While there are some interesting ideas here, the overall effect is likely to leave you scratching your head and saying "hunh?"This is a very, very gory movie. The gore effects range all the way from full bloody head appliances to a silly Video Toaster effect that has to be freeze-framed to be (dis)believed. The "Fangoria" level of gross-out effects in this film is really amazing and should likely please the gore-hounds while making anyone with a weak constitution feel a bit on the queasy side.The Broken Skull is also an extremely noisy movie. It features not only ambient noises (captured by mikes and not replaced in post), but there is a lot of shrieking. No, no, I mean a LOT. A lot, a lot! Characters scream, wail, howl and yell, chitter and laugh maniacally. Turn down the volume if you value your eardrums and your nerves! But you can't fault the cast for their enthusiasm, they really eat up the scenery and sometimes the effect is rather entertaining. In particular, the actress playing a certain Vietnamese immigrant delivers all of the above with a remarkable amount of gusto.In fact, very few of the actors were wooden. Some of them may have overacted a bit (oh, just a wee smidgen!), but most of them are certainly fun to watch go off. The cast is ethnically diverse and kudos to the filmmakers for that. The two middle-aged white women, however, are two of the most spiteful, exasperated characters since the shopkeeper in the MST3k classic "the Brute Man." Just watch them seethe at all the other characters, it's fun!In closing, the Headcrusher may not become a horror icon on a par with Jason Voorhees, Michael Myers or Freddy Kruger (or even the Leprechaun), but we can definitely say this ... this was a movie. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0

The director is sweet , as is his co - directing wife Shira Geffen , but their movie sucks . It has its moments ( and some pretty girls ) , but there is too much of everything : " Amélie " meets " Breaking the waves " meets " Pauline at the beach " . You walk away wanting to know more about the wedding photographer , and about the girl who likes it best when nothing happens , be it in movies or in real life . Instead , you get a suicidal writer , a neurotic actress and an illegal - immigrant - come - social - worker with a heart of gold .

The 1935 version of " Enchanted April " manages to be simultaneously tediousand perfunctory . It is difficult to show the transformative magic of Italy shooting in a studio with only unimaginative Italian behavior to belabor . The transformation of the four strangers fleeing London is instantaneous in the cut from the first day to a week later . Rather than develop , the screenplay flips a switch and thecharacters are different . The husbands exist boring enough in flashbacks without turning up , even if their presence does not drive the four women back into their shells and/or hostilities . Jessie Ralph has the most fun ( moving instead of entirely chewing up thescenery ) and Katharine Alexander has some poignant charm out of herhusband 's shadow ( and away from his hideous droning ) . Ann Harding isunremarkable here ( with the Production Code being enforced ) . She had anappropriate line in an earlier ( pre - Code ) movie , " When Ladies Meet " : " You'renot worth a moment of one anxious hour that either one of us has given you , " but in " Enchanted April " can only look hurt , rush out , and proclaim fealty to her errant husband . sub_rate: 0.014218009478672985; NE_rate: 0.0

Lois Weber's film "Hypocrites" was and still kind of is a very bold and daring film. I enjoyed it and was very impressed by the filming and story of it. The priest sees the hypocrisy of the people in his church and tries to show them the "naked" truth. The people are appalled when he reveals the naked statue portraying truth, after failing to lead them to it and the few that did, help along the way. The people do not want to face the truth that they are doing anything wrong, but it shows them putting things before God, going to beach parties acting inappropriate, their materialistic ways, and other things in which the people of our world do that tend to not be morally right. In the end, failing to gain any followers, he must enter into the gates of heaven alone. This film seems to me to be very bold, in the fact that a naked woman is shown throughout it, especially considering the time period in which this film was made. The imagery and symbolism portrayed in this movie I found incredible. The way they made the naked woman translucent and using a naked woman to symbolize the naked truth shows a lot of creativity and art. Showing the different sins of the people as they walked down the road and refused to follow along the path, each with different excuses, setbacks, and/or higher priorities, was a great way of representing the people of today. This film does a very good job of getting the moral message across to its audience. Lois Weber has a tremendous way of capturing her spectators' attention with her creativity, symbolism, visuals, and through auditory. Even the music of the piano throughout this film is very beautiful and fitting with the whole theme. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
" San Francisco , Oh you marvelously desolated town , Thank You , God , for destroying it , and making bricks fall on our collective heads , and for pummeling into oblivion tens of thousands of Your innocent , obedient sheep , oh Lord , who art so merciful in thy Heavenly ways ... " These should have been the lyrics to the title song of this oh - so inspiring and perfectly mindless film . The movie starts well enough , with Gable discovering a Cinderella with a highly annoying but very - appreciated operatic voice , and she soon shoots to stardom . One of the many problems with our Cinderella is that she is played by Jeanette MacDonald , who , if one " takes the time " to look through all that make - up and 30s glitz facade , realizes that she is kind of ugly . Too ugly to be playing THIS role , anyway . Yet Gable and everyone else fawn all over here as if she were some damn beauty or something . Another problem with Cinderella is that her character is then absolutely humble , wholesome , innocent , God - loving , kind , and generous - enough to make you vomit for a full hour . MacDonald plays her ( admittedly one - dimensional ) role with the sort of " ahhh " , " oh " , and " ooh " that serves to annoy rather than make her sympathetic . Tracy has been better , and had better roles , than playing this clichéd , heart - of - gold , God - loving , non - child - molesting priest ( who boxes in his " free time " - as if priests have anything to do - how cute ) . Even the ever - reliable Gable is not up to his usual standard ; he is far too animated , and his character is far too selfless for someone who is supposed to be an ambitious Western " scoundrel " ( though this , obviously , is the book 's fault).The game is basically this : Gable and his rival Holt play ping - pong with Cinderella - using her as the ball . How ? Well , first she is working ( singing ) for Gable , then she works for the square Holt , then she goes back to Gable , only to return very soon to Holt . ( And , of course , both want to have her as girlfriend / wife . ) And if the earthquake had n't interrupted this table - tennis plot , it 's a safe bet that she would have been bouncing back - and - forth another ten times , the wishy - washy little princess that she is . There are many , far too many in fact , musical numbers . It 's almost as though they tried to make the first " disaster - movie musical " ever . How silly . The stuff she sings in Gable 's " joint " is okay , but when she starts belting out those high - pitched , annoying whines during the opera segments , that is when I felt that my ears were unprovokingly and unjustly attacked by enemy sound - fire . In fact , there is an opera number that lasts 6 DAMN MINUTES . 6 may seem like little , for those who have n't had first - hand Vietoperanam experience with such horrors of audio torture , but it 's like with dog years ; a dog 's year is equivalent to seven human ones . A minute of opera is equivalent to 100 minutes of Chinese torture ( or a dog urinating acid on your leg).I thought this was a disaster movie , but it 's more like a near - disaster movie . ( I read that some of the dialog in this film was written by a SILENT - ERA FILM DIRECTOR . Jesus ... ) The melodramatic , and only occasionally amusing , proceedings get interrupted by the real star of this movie ( namely , the earthquake ) , only after well over one - and - a - half hours . When Joe the earthquake finally does shake up the city , and our clichéd characters in it , I almost felt like saying " Thank God , death and destruction are finally here ! " . Unfortunately , Joe comes too late into the movie to save it from its increasing mediocrity ; the scenes of devastation are very good , but even the earthquake part of the movie gets ruined ( pun ) by a highly annoying , religious ending . You see , Gable , who professes to be an atheist all along ( without actually using the word itself ) , finally finds MacDonald alive - after having searched for days - and suddenly he is converted into a believer because Cinderella is alive ? ! ! How stupid ! All that tells me is that Gable 's character is a weak - minded moron . The movie ends on a very dumb note , indeed . Gable , having said " thank you " to God for " saving " his girl ( and he does his on his knees ) " finds " God ( sees the light ) , and the movie 's little old devil Gable converts himself into a believer . How very God - fearingly American an ending ... Of course , no one thought of asking this " God " why the hell there was an earthquake in the first place ! The sad and unintentional irony is that Gable in the end becomes a " sucker " ; all along he had made fun of " suckers " who fall for the holiest scam of them all - namely religion - and in the end he himself becomes one . Now that 's what I call a triumph of the human spirit ! Another irony is that the ending was supposed to have improved Gable as a person , but I see it quite differently ; on the contrary : it took only one big Joe to turn Gable into a God - fearing , meek , little , obedient believer - who joins the world 's sheep family . And as if this intellectual downfall of Gable 's was n't pathetic and disappointing enough , this first - ever " earthquake musical " ends with a truly hair - raising ( take this word as you will ) , noble , and hope - inspiringly beautiful mass - choir scene : dozens ( or hundreds ) of earthquake survivors and proud , proud citizens of Frisco spontaneously ( or did " God " perhaps arrange it ? ) sing all together the title song in hope for a better , brighter , Joe - less future . Hallelujah ! If you are a " sucker " for Hollywood sentimentality , do not skip this movie . sub_rate: 0.0050041701417848205; NE_rate: 0.0
There is something about Doug McLure 's appearance in a movie that is a warranty of wretchedness . His DG initials are like a special cinema - certification , that comes somewhere before ' U ' . Cushing , on the other hand , seemed to suffer   from both a dilatory agent and poor judgement of his own . He did excellent work in the Hammer movies as Dr Van Helsing . I'v seen him do a very passable Sherlock Holmes in ' Hound Of The Baskervilles ' . And his magnum opus was probably Grand Moff Tarkin in the first ' Star Wars ' . The only man but the emperor who could tell Darth Vadar to ' stop bickering ' and get away with it . But - crikey ! - he 's done some turkeys . There was that lamentable ' Daleks ' movie for one .

I think Walter Pidgeon was badly miscast in this film . Just not believable in the role . Barbara Eden was beautiful , and acted her part well enough . No one else was at totally memorable . I remember the TV series spun off from this movie when I was a small child . I even think I had a plastic " Seaview " that would submerse and was great for playing with in the bathtub . Long time ago . As for some of the other criticism I 've read for this film : It 's certainly unfair to judge special effects or science knowledge of 4 decades ago by today 's standards . The effects were OK for 1961 . Not great , but OK . As for the science , that was ludicrous even for 1961 . There 's no excuse . Also , the sub was awfully roomy . I understand that the navy refused any help at all for this film , so maybe the filmmakers just had no idea . Overall , the film bored me . ( And I 'm a sci - fi fan . ) Ca n't recommend this one .

A disturbing film, this, climaxing, as it does, with an intensely intimate reunion between a naked man and his young son, but in its confused structure it contains a poetically imagined visual exploration of the innocence of an idealised amnesiac.The plot follows two threads, the weaker of which is the gradual revelation of Graham/Pablo's condition. Wound through this, though, is a beautiful description of his condition, and his meandering path towards a partial awakening, driven by his affair with Irene.The affair is the strong thread, while the specifics of the plot are carried by a seemingly tacked on collection of characters: Graham's best friend, who can reveal the cause of his condition in a clunking flashback, his manipulative boss and his comic book mad scientist psychologist: all of whom have an interest in keeping him lost and dependent.The failure of the film lies in the conflict between the two threads. One is visual, meandering and sublime, while the other is structured like an inept thriller, all expository dialogue and unresolved patterns of symbolism.Nevertheless, I enjoyed Novo. It keeps flirting with the abyss of taboo and shying away into something beautiful, as in the quarry, with the double bassist and the two women, when a setup for a scene of cheap pornography becomes a segment of peace and rejuvenation. I still don't get the tooth, though.Odd, clunky and a narrative failure, but with an almost redeeming beauty. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0

I saw this on cable. Someone had to lose their job for greenlighting this one for air. Just because a movie is made does not mean it has to be shown! Savage Instinct should be shown in ALL film classes. It is the perfect template for how to not make a movie. The editing alone is so jumbled you'll think it was assembled by a team of trained (poorly) monkeys, traveling across unpaved canyon road in the back of a jeep, blindfolded and drunk. The audio is often not legible. Acting? I can't call anything I saw here acting. Reciting? Hmmm. Can't call it that either. Failing? That works. All that being said...IT IS HILARIOUS!

No , no , no . That is my advice to you if you are wanting to see this film . Anthony Perkins is the one and ONLY Norman Bates , as is Janet Leigh in her role as Marion Crane . This scarcely seems like a colorized reading of Psycho , with a few gently different touches thrust in for a more modern solicitation . Vaughn is ho as ominous Norman , and Viggo Mortenson 's Sam Loomis seems also much the cowboy compared to the original . Please folks , do yourself some justice . Do n't bother with this .

This is maybe the men down worst movie every made , that actually took itself seriously . And not as a result of the acting , because being an player , I have to say that Rickman and Stowe had to be at their best , just to escape needing electro convulsive therapy after the principle photography wrapped . Being one of the 57 people that actually saw this movie in theatrical tone , I have to say I have never before or since experienced a movie where the movie ended , credits rolled , the house lights went on , and no one moved from their seats . About five minutes after the house lights went up people started coming out of their comas to look around , and I think most of us thought , okay we get it , that was a joke , good ? , they are going to show the real movie now . Eventually , after the ushers handed out disguises , and we swore an oath of secrecy to never admit we were there , we felt that it was good to leave , praying that we would not be seen leaving the auditorium . I have seen some passably tough movies in my day , ( I possess Cinemax for goodness sakes ) , but I am still bitter that I will never , ever be able to recover those two or so hours of my lifetime that I lost watching Closet Ford . sub_rate: 0.043478260869565216; NE_rate: 0.0
Title: Dracula A.D. 1972 Director: Alan Gibson Cast: Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee, Stephanie Beacham Review: Sometimes movies can be time capsules that transport you back to any given time. In this case...our time capsule is Hammers Dracula A.D. 1972 which transports us back to a time in which Austin Powers would have felt right at home.The story is about these group of kids (were not a gang! were a group!) that love to hang out at a café shop called "The Cavern". One day, Johnny Alucard (hmm strange last name...wait...it spells Dracula backwards!) a new member of the group offers the group a new way to get their kicks. He offers them a night of black mass and black magic. To which they also say "sure why the hell not, it could be fun!". So in no time flat, the find themselves resurrecting Count Dracula from the ashes.This movie opens up with a swinging party at some rich doofuses home. He knows non of the people at his party, yet there they all are partying the night away in his house. Doing drugs, making out and dancing on top of tables. The filmmakers made sure that this sequence was completely engulfed in whatever young people considered cool at that time. Everyone says words like "way out" and "groovy" and they finish many of their sentences saying "all that jazz". So yeah, its pretty evident that this is the 70s. To top it all off, there's a band that sounds something like "Jefferson Airplane"...I mean you'll be drowned in all things 70s. And as I watched this I kept asking myself "how the heck is Dracula with his black cape and get up going to fit into all this?" And thats exactly what happens. Old Dracula feels out of place amidst all the partying and the rock and roll and drugs. Many of the scenes in the film are great....but sadly the music they decided to add to the proceedings doesn't fit at all and completely takes you out of the mood of things. Something horrifying or scary will be happening on screen and suddenly a bunch of loud trumpets and congos start to beat and your just completely taken out of the horror element. That sucked out the atmosphere right out of this movie for me.But all in all, putting all the distracting 70s music aside (an illness that Satanic Rites of Dracula also suffered) the movie was pretty good. But I will mention this. The story was just a re-hash of what we had seen before in Taste the Blood of Dracula. In fact the story is damn near identical. Lets see...a young lad inherits Draculas ring and ashes...check. He then decides to bring Dracula back to life with the help of some people who know nothing about what they are getting into...check. Black Mass to bring Dracula back in a desecrated church...check. The list of similarities goes on and on. So this movie ain't very original if you ask me.There are a few things that make this movie worth while though. For example the fact that the movie is a time capsule to London in the early seventies makes the film entertaining. I kept giggling and laughing every time someone spoke in 70 jargon. I couldn't believe some of the clothes these people wore and the cars they drove! It made the movie fun for me, but we are here to get spooked, were here to see Drac kill a few virgins and take his revenge on the House of Van Helsing. Did we get any of that? Well yeah. There's a few good sequences squeezed in there to satisfy old school hammer fans. First off, there's the Black Mass sequence which was above all things satanic! They mention the name of many a demon and lots blood is spilled. That sequence was awesome but it was messed up by the music in its most crucial moment. Then there's Draculas actual resurrection which Ill admit was great from a visual standpoint. Some mist comes out of Draculas grave and slowly but surely Christopher Lees silhouette and face emerge from the fog. Cool shot! I loved it! We have a Cushing and Lee face off at the end. And I couldn't help to laugh at one point when Dracula hurls a piece of furniture through the air. I laugh because he has done this in every single film since Horror of Dracula. Its this Hammer tradition where the characters start throwing candle sticks and chairs at each other. And I think to myself, aren't their more exciting things to show then a bad guy throwing a candle stick at our hero. Oh well, anyhows, Draculas demise in this one is very similar to all the other Hammer Draculas before it, vampire gets slaked and then we cut to a series of frames until there's only ashes left.All in all, an unintentionally funny Hammer Dracula film. Its trapped in the 70s and though that makes it a fun watch (and its not as horrible as Satanic Rites of Dracula) it still doesn't gel well with the Dracula universe we had come to expect from Hammer.Rating 3 1/2 out of 5 sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0

I ' m writing this as I watch the DVD . I grabbed for the laptop and went to IMDb during the first song . I did n't know anything about picture movie except that a friend said that the show was supposed to be good . It has nice decent Netflix rating too , so here I am . Maybe on the stage this worked . But I have to say that the sight of chorus boys dancing and wholly completely hardly just whacky silly . And the lip syncing to a prerecorded score adds to the strangeness . Most of the songs and exist are about aspects of nudeness nudity . This is thought idea zip nothing good sorry . account score indeed so far , is generic line medicine music zip Nothing memorable , or particularly melodic . Everything is to serve the lyrics .

Kind of in the hopes that one of them will be different , maintain entertaining enough to keep me from going on to the next scene . Nope . Okay . I ' m finished . So here 's what I think . If you have any experience or long - standing head of musical theater , scarcely this -- it 's just not quality . If , festal , you 're a gay twenty - something and have never seen or heard a musical comedy , you might be entertained maintain Or sake this would hold your interest if fortune ' ve never seen a lot of attractive naked men .

at first i thought ' nasaan ka man ' might be one of those progressive new filipino films . as someone noted earlier , the picture does not look poorly made . it 's clear that the directors used more expensive cameras to shoot , better angles , better sound equipment , good - looking actors , and nicer locations.however , the improvements exist altogether purely trivial . if it were n't for all the polish and expensive filters , ' nasaan ka man ' would feel just like your typical , second - pace local movie - - hyperactive drama , predictable game twists , " yeah right ! " moments , crying , screaming , and characters you could care less about , all shoved down your throat.a couple of things annoyed me about this picture . first of all , since when is it fine to have sex with adopted family ? that not - blood - related argument does not make an ounce of difference . second , would a woman really not tell anyone for 40 years that she was raped , simply because the father told her to keep it secret ? and , where the hell were the lights in this movie ? i know the director tried to progress things look extremely dramatic , but i was only thrust to turn up the brightness feature on my TV set . sub_rate: 0.05042016806722689; NE_rate: 0.0
I walked out of this movie and I did this only one time before with the Australian movie Sweetie close to 20 years ago. After about three minutes I felt like killing the camera man and just couldn't believe that this film actually showed anywhere and- guess what - was nominated for two independent Spirit Awards. What???? Regardsless how realistic the dialog might be (I will NEVER use the word "dude" again!) -who wants to listen to these conversations? I don't go to the movies to be annoyed but that's all I got. The only good thing I came away with was the realization that if this movie can make it to Sundance and other festivals, anybody can. Well, wait, that might not be a good thing after all... sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
This is an old-dark-house movie. A young couple creep around a weird mansion said to be run by Satan, where they run from and into one after another of an ill-assorted crew: a lady in distress, an ape, an ape-man, a midget, various odd-looking people, and (for some reason) two Chinese. They end up in a throne room where the hero is required to play a "Price Is Right" sort of contest involving a climb up seven steps with seven illuminated footprints; hence the title. For my taste it's too much of the same thing. The creeping around fun-house corridors is amusing for a while, then becomes repetitive. By comparison with Harold Lloyd or Buster Keaton or Laurel and Hardy doing the same bit in two reels, it isn't truly funny. It's not frightening either, and apparently wasn't intended to be: the household is too absurd. Most films in this genre balance the comedy with a genuine threat, and usually two--one that the characters are led to believe is real, and another for which it's a cover. Here the cover isn't to be taken seriously, and neither is what covered. A few moments of fun emerge from the mix, but it's rather heavy fun. The novel on which the film was based was a straight thriller and I think could have been played straight to better effect--and still could be. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
Tycoon will never be listed as one of John Wayne 's better post Stagecoach film . It 's good in spots , has some fine action sequences in the cave in and also in the flood at the climax . But the plot leaves a fortune to be desired . What we have in Tycoon is two men who thoroughly dislike each other and that dislike prevents them from working as a team . Multimillionaire Cedric Hardwicke has hired John Wayne and James Gleason to build a railroad . But then he refuses to give them the needed funds to do the job right . Things get really complicated when Wayne falls for Hardwicke 's daughter , Laraine Day . After a night when they have to spend time alone in an Inca ruin , by convention in South America , Wayne and Day get a shotgun wedding even though nothing happened . What should have happened is these two should have been locked in a room for 24 hours together to work out their differences one way or another . Their petty spites cause some fatalities among Wayne 's crew . But what Tycoon is most known for is another piece of pettiness . Laraine Day was married to Leo Durocher the manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers when this was being filmed . He was a constant presence on the set , insanely jealous of John Wayne who he thought might be having an affair with his wife . Nothing to it , but he made his wife 's life miserable . Not one of the Duke 's better efforts . sub_rate: 0.003676470588235294; NE_rate: 0.0
... or should I say unintentionally hilarious ? Either way , this is one of the best comedies I 've seen in a long time .

If I had to describe this movie to someone , I 'd call it a mutated hybrid of Fatal Attraction , Dumb and Dumber , and the Three Stooges , with a " climax " uncannily similar to the episode of Family Guy in which the whole family gets into a knock - down fistfight in the living room .

Even MST3 K could n't make this painful , long , and ultimately mind - bending drek funny or entertaining .

**May Contain Spoilers**The main character, a nobleman named Fallon, is stranded on an island with characters so looney and lethal he might have been better off drowning. Count Lorente de Sade (pronounced "dee-SAYd") talks to his own hallucinations and sees all intruders on the island as invading pirates. He routinely beats mute servant Anne and tortures his unwilling guests in the dungeon. Inadvertant laughs are provided by giant "Nubian" slave Mantis who talks with a Deep South accent and helps de Sade hunt down trespassers in the style of THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME. De Sade's crazed wife, ravaged by leprosy, provides some truly scary moments as she prowls the dungeon and embraces a helplessly chained prisoner. (This scene was viewed on late-night TV by many kids who carried the memory into adulthood.) The one nearly-normal person in sight is Cassandra, who has self-deprecation down to a science. ("I used to be a nurse, now I'm not much of anything.") She and Fallon plan their escape and ultimately encounter an enemy more fearsome than de Sade and Mantis combined.	This movie was shot in San Antonio and directed by a man more competent at drawing horror comics than making horror movies. (I'll say this much for Mr. Boyette--he does showcase his fixatation with contagion here, as he did in his comics.) It's rather like an Andy Milligan melodrama minus the meat cleavers. The period wardrobe, library music, abuse of the handicapped and all-around misanthropy makes one wonder if Andy wasn't called in as a consultant. However, Milligan made better costumes and wrote better dialogue. Technical gaffes are too numerous to list here but you know this flick is in trouble when you see the opening shipwreck, which looks like it was shot in a fish tank. Also, a film made in Texas should have had real spiders and snakes rather than rubber ones. Glorious Eastmancolor gives this melodrama the garish look it so richly deserves. Fallon's initial encounter with the leprous Countess is truly horrifying, as is the movie's parting shot. If the rest had been half as harrowing, THE DUNGEON OF HARROW would have been a terror classic. Instead it's a funny piece of schlock that trash-fiends will love, for all the wrong reasons. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0

I thought it might be a cool little movie , judging by the game summary , since yknow I ' ve blindly rented such gems as Frailty and Ford Nightmare before . But this is just abominal . It 's about a killer who uses Edgar Allen Poe 's works as reference for his murderous exploits , and the story of a detective who has to stop him . Ca n't these blithering hacks make a good movie without defiling the grave of a great horror writer ? I mean , the kills in exist altogether free devoid of thought or originality , and the references to Poe are hokey and fake , without enough thought put into them . They 're shallow , and they put Poe 's work to shame good Full of holes , with amazing sequencing . playacting acting high bad too , reminding me of the abortion that was known in some third world countries as " Fear X " , what with all the pausing and un - emotional lines .

* * Possible Spoilers * * Three young people on the wrong side of the law are given a chance to turn their lives around and become useful members of society by becoming undercover cops in ` The Mod Squad , ' a resurrection of the hit television series of the 60 's , directed by Scott Silver . Given their less than stellar backgrounds , and because of who they are and the people they know , Julie David ( Claire Danes ) , Pete Cochran ( Giovanni Ribisi ) and Lincoln Hayes ( Omar Epps ) can go places other cops ca n't , so they are tapped by Captain Adam Greer ( Dennis Farina ) to infiltrate a seedy night spot suspected of being a front for a prostitution ring . For a start , Julie gets a job there as a waitress , while Pete and Linc just ` hang out ' to find out what they may . Julie quickly becomes reacquainted with an old boyfriend , Billy Waites ( Josh Brolin ) , who turns out to be involved with drugs , which are tied in to the shady dealings going down at the bar . Before it 's over , the ` squad ' is in it up to their necks , while also running afoul of a bunch of wrong cops who are also involved with the drugs , and consequently tied in with their investigation . From the beginning of the movie , there is a sense that you are coming in late ; as if it 's presupposed that you know what 's going on as far as the origin and workings of the squad . All you get here are brief mug - shot bios of the three that give you nothing more than a glimpse into their past ; there 's nothing about how this all actually came about . The thinking was probably that by doing it this way it would lead into the story quicker , get things moving along . While this is true to a certain extent , some added background would have made the texture of the story a bit more interesting ; the way it was done here merely depreciates the credibility of the entire proceedings . The plot is marginal to begin with , and any time spent on character development would have been well worth the while . What 's delivered , and quite unimaginatively at that , is a less than compelling story filled with one dimensional characters . The performances are satisfactory , but the actors get no help from the script , nor apparently from Silver ; Danes , Ribisi and Epps come close to fleshing out Julie , Pete and Linc , but given the time allotted them , combined with the lack of support , they still fall way short of giving these people life . Farina , a good actor who deserves better than what he gets here , comes off as nothing more than a caricature of the ` good cop . ' There 's a feeling that everything was given the once - over in this film ; some detail and nuance would have driven the stock up considerably on this one . The supporting cast includes Richard Jenkins ( Detective Mothershed ) , Steve Harris ( Briggs ) , Larry Brandenburg ( Eckford ) , Lionel Mark Smith ( Lanier ) and Sam McMurray ( Tricky ) . It 's a shame to see the acting talent involved here wasted like this ; a lot more thought and planning should have gone into the making of this movie . As it is , it comes across as ill - conceived and poorly executed . Danes , Ribisi and Epps are like Major Leaguers who got stuck playing for all the marbles at the local sandlot ; instead of getting a shot at the title , they all got hung out to dry . Like Terry says in ` On The Waterfront , ' ` You was my brother , Charlie , you shoulda been looking out for me . ' Well , it 's obvious that there was no Charlie to look out for them here , and after ` The Mod Squad , ' they can all just hope for something better to come along the next time . I rate this one 1/10 . sub_rate: 0.0013422818791946308; NE_rate: 0.0
Harrison Ford plays Sergeant Dutch Van Den Broeck of the District of Columbia Police Department . He tries to get the bad guys , but does n't arrange a very good job . When we meet up with him he 's trying to catch a corrupt undercover officer . Kristin Scott Thomas plays a New Hampshire Senator , Kay Chandler , trying to get reelected . She 's running against a candidate who has plenty of money . The last thing she needs is the death of her husband . She 's a politician- she ca n't be bogged down by feelings . This story moves slowly and painfully . I was looking at my watch every five minutes wondering when it would be over ! The story gets lost in details the director , Sydney Pollack , did n't need to put in . We do n't want to know about Dutch 's police investigations . They throw in some insight to politicians and the spin control ' they do for campaigns . After seeing the movie I 'm still wondering why they got involved romantically . Does n't anybody mourn anymore ? Do n't you need more than two weeks to even consider going horizontal ' with someone else?It was good to see actress , comedian , Chicago native and Second City Alumni Bonnie Hunt .

This movie is not worth seeing , at least not at a cinema . The story is hard to follow and understand ( it starts with 10 minutes of something happening 3 years earlier ) . It 's hard to know if this movie is trying to be a comedy or just is so high / weird that it sometimes seems like it . American sirens and lights on Swedish police cars is just one example . The acting of Persbrandt and Bergqvist is good as usual , but I think Jenny Lampa acting as Jasmin acts very inadequate . Zara Zetterqvist acts pretty well , she 's not been seen as an actor in Swedish movies for a long time .

The film is set in Newcastle on Tyne in north east England , the town where I was born and grew up . The film is also fundamentally dishonest - the manner it presents the town , the kids , but above all the men of the town . In this film they are all unintelligent , violent , thieving , thugs . I suppose I could comment on the game ( predictable ) , the performances ( competently unattractive ) , the charge ( faineant and unimaginative ) , but to me that is all irrelevant compared to the director 's vilification to the town and its people .

When I first became a father about 5.5 years ago, I was prepared for many of the sacrifices I'd have to make. I knew I'd have to change diapers and take them to swimming lessons and attend many a freezing Santa Claus parade, but I wasn't ready for the kind of sacrifice I made last night. This, in my humble opinion, is cruel and unusual punishment.Underdog is bad. It's not quite Karate Dog bad, but it makes The Shaggy Dog feel like Pulp Fiction. If Underdog were a television show, I'd recommend flipping on by. Not even the presence of Puddy and the voice of Banky Edwards can save it. Bow. Wow.It was also just about the best 80 minutes I've ever enjoyed. James was seated to the right of me and Michelle to the left, and I spent more time watching their reaction to this talking, flying mutt than watching the screen. At 5 and 3 years old, they were the target audience, and this movie nailed the target. There's a scene where Underdog belches loudly in another dogs face and Michelle thought it was the funniest scene ever captured on film. When Underdog was flying into outer space, James was literally at the edge of his seat, mesmerized. The kids absolutely loved Underdog, and that's why I was there. That's what last night was all about.Unless you're accompanying someone under the age of ten, you have no business wasting a second of your life watching this brutal film. But if you are looking to kill 80 minutes with your four year old, I won't judge. I had a blast. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
What ever happened to shows with united parental figures? The parents in this show are nearly as irresponsible as the children. Instead of punishing the youngest child for being manipulative, they let her get away with murder. They can't ever agree on a course of action when it comes to dealing with the children, and instead they do nothing. Yeah, great plan. Just ignore their behavior because they're "cute." This show tells the already manipulative preteens that watch it that the "divide and conquer" technique is the best way to get their parents to "cave." The oldest children are constantly running amok and getting themselves into all sorts of impossible situations, but there are no consequences for their actions. Yeah, great television all right. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
For a series that was inspired by Kolchak , it 's ironic that The X Files first attempt at a vampire episode should land squarely on it 's ass . 3 has always puzzled me and - at the risk of sounding like the unspeakable Hans Keller - I 've often wondered if I 'm missing the point . The story feels like a jigsaw that has pieces that do n't match the box , and the result is you spending a cosy evening by the fire trying to match sky that is really sea . This incomplete feeling remains no matter how many times you revisit the episode and no matter how much attention you give it . I know that this review puts me in danger of being dragged to Whitby by teenage vampires who 'll drink my blood while listening to Busted , but that 's a risk I 'm willing to take . I 've always been a werewolf man myself . sub_rate: 0.006024096385542169; NE_rate: 0.0
humble budget horror movie . If you do n't raise your expectations too high , you 'll probably enjoy this little flick . Beginning and end are pretty good , middle drags at times and seems to go nowhere for long periods as we watch the goings on of the insane that add atmosphere but do not advance the plot . Quite a bit of gore . I enjoyed Bill McGhee 's performance which he made quite believable for such a low budget picture , he managed to carry the movie at times when nothing much seemed to be happening . Nurse Charlotte Beale , played by Jesse Lee , played her character well so be prepared to want to slap her toward the end ! She makes some really stupid mistakes but then , that 's what makes these low budget movies so good ! I would have been out of that place and five states away long before she even considered that it might be a good idea to leave ! If you enjoy this movie , try Committed from 1988 which is basically a rip off of this movie . sub_rate: 0.0051813471502590676; NE_rate: 0.0
" The Brotherhood of Satan " is a stupefying combination of conventional horror elements mixed with some imaginative characterization and direction ( Bernard McEveety ) . It all starts out with father Charles Bateman ( as Ben ) driving out west with his pretty blondes : luscious Ahna Capri ( as Nicky ) , and daughter Geri Reischl ( as K.T. ) . Things get weirder and weirder for the trio , as they approach the town of Hillsboro , which is being gripped by a Satanic cult ! When the dullish travelers hit Hillsboro , the " action " switches to the film 's more interesting assemblage of characters : townies L.Q. Jones ( as Pete , the sheriff ) , Strother Martin ( as Doc ) , Charles Robinson ( as Jack , the priest ) , and Alvy Moore ( as Tobey ) . Their interplay is sometimes fun . Soon enough , it all gets very whacky , and predictable . Mr. Martin is the stand - out ( as you might expect ) ; he considers the possibility of a Satanic cult to be a " cock - and - bull story " , but is ( of course ) their leader . The " Come in , Children " ending is puzzling ; unless , perhaps , it was the film 's original title . sub_rate: 0.004329004329004329; NE_rate: 0.0

Well, first off, the twins are exactly the same. there is no one is girly and one is tomboy (Ashley is taller than Mary-Kate though) and their boyfriends aren't even French, so that is bad because they are faking the accents. Lamo. It is also not that bad, not their best. I am A big Mary-Kate and Ashley fan, don't get me wrong. the storyline is OK and it is funny to watch. it is not the type of movie that you would watch over and over again. But hey, when they made this movie they were still new at the whole making their own movie thing. The girls also act like they are older then 13. but if you are a young viewer this is a good movie. Not so good if you are older than 13 unless you are a parent watching a movie with your kids. then it's OK. Good luck MK+A with your future movies! sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
I have never seen the original 1930s version of the film , but this remake is one of the worst I have seen from a major production studio in years . Seeing actors such as Meg Ryan and Annette Bening , once near A level talents , sleepwalk their way through poorly scripted roles is unspeakable . There appeared to be no desire to be in front of the camera for anyone in this film . Jada Pinkett Smith and Debra Messing play wretched roles that have no bearing on the plot and add no entertainment value . Jada Pinkett Smith 's character is used as nothing more than a ploy to appear modern , having an African American lesbian character , but in actuality she is there to just look cool . There is no actual reason why Messing in this film other than to fill out the amount of women in the original I take . The side characters played by Eva Mendes and Debi Mazar are stereotypical female characters , with Mendes portraying the vixen looking to steal the wealthy but bored and mildly neglected husband and Mazar covering the gossip roles . The movie is ho , lacking charm , humor , or sympathy for any characters . It almost felt like the movie was a punishment for everyone involved , whether in front of or behind the camera . There is one glimmering hope in the film , however little it is allowed to shine surrounded by the dim and dying stars around it is Cloris Leachman . Leachman is still an amazing talent that brings her remarkable charm and humor to the film , in the small role that she has . sub_rate: 0.010416666666666666; NE_rate: 0.0
Ugh . Stephen Baldwin . I never noticed until I got the DVD home and saw his name in the credits . Double ugh . What 's worse , HE 'S the NAME in this humble budget , mindless , wandering , wannabe shoot'em up . I mean , where did they find the guy to write this refuse ? Driving a caterpillar in the LA City Dump , while hoping to break into the movie game ? The whole plot is farcical situation piled on ridiculous premise . Baldwin is equally convincing as a poster boy for American Gothic , sans pitchfork . His whole acting repertoire is looking like he needs the potty and then looking like he found it . So , there you have it folks : bad hand , defective acting by no - name actors , low - budget setting and a hero that 's about as convincing as a girl scout looking for a cookie customer as an action hero . It 's too late for me to get my money back on the DVD , but you can spare yourself-- unless you 're one of those who likes to look at the dogs for a laugh ... frankly , this one is too ho to be funny . sub_rate: 0.027777777777777776; NE_rate: 0.0
How many monster tree movies can you see in a lifetime?Well I 'll go out on a limb and say one . This movie is better watched late at night , with a 12 pack of beer , the sound off and you and your friends making up the dialogue . On a Pacific Island a young man is sentenced to death for consorting with the " evil Americans".(Seems his loving wife has been sleeping with the witch doctor and they set him up to die so the doc ' can be king).Well he vows to come back and wreak revenge . Before you can shake a stick the goofy natives run to the American scientists ' hut screaming"Tobanga come!"It seems the young corpse has done just that as Tobanga , the walking tree monster . Yes his revenge is tremendous ( and so is this movie).It seems that these natives can not run from a lumbering tree so he tosses them in quicksand , rolls them down hills etc . Pretty soon the new king wants to trade his woman or kingdom for an axe or a chainsaw . General problems with this movie are numerous . The comedy relief is an obnoxious woman with a Cockney accent ( like this movie needs comedy).You want her to die upon her first appearance . The leading lady is whiny . The leading man is a boor . The acting is wooden ( pun intended).The dialogue is stiff and lumbering . The natives have Brooklyn accents . The monster suit is pure giggles . While this is a big movie it still is fun to watch . It gets a 3 on unintentional laughs alone . Your dog may rate it just a bit higher but only if the tree was n't mobile . sub_rate: 0.006600660066006601; NE_rate: 0.0

Endless repetition about the evil World Bank , IMF , Globalization , and the Americans are blamed for all of Africa 's problemsand the movie is long , about two hours , but it seems longer . The French actually occupied Mali , the country in which the movie takes place , for centuries , but are only peripheral bad guys . One does n't learn decent about any of the characters to really care what 's happening to themthey are completely marginal to the preaching , which goes on and on and on . There 's no plot , no character development , no humor ( except for a few pokes at Bush and Wolfowitz , but that 's almost cheating it 's so easy ) and the production values are mediocreno redemption there . It is amazing that a movie can spend two hours preaching about such a great topic and convey perfectly zero real information . The Irish ballad " I was dying , and then the famine came " has more content . The movie is ho , the sub - titles are tough to read , there is no real content about the subject of the film , and the propaganda is relentless .

David Eater is set in a humble desert town in Alabama where dimension developer David Krantz ( David David ) is financing the construction of a vast resort . hours hours hours 7 of his workers Riley ( David Starks ) , Hansen ( Adrian Alvarado ) & David ( David Rae ) exist digging foundations in the desert when they unearth what looks like a tomahawk axe , unfortunately for them an ancient Australian Australian monster called the bone eater comes along & kills them . Local sheriff David Evans ( David Boxleitner ) shortly has Krantz breathing down his neck as the expression of his resort grinds to a stoppage , David Evans likewise has to get with the bone eater monster as it kills anyone it comes across ... You have I consider myself a reasonably great fan of the horror & sci - fi music , I sure do n't remember my impression is worth more than anyone else 's ( unlike many here on the IMDb ... ) but please think me when I say that David Eater is the worst Ford - Ford Ford Ford Ford Ford Ford I have always seen & it 's up against some unsaved warm competition . As a horror & sci - fi fan there exist 7 names that when involved with a motion send shudders down my backbone in expectation of how tough it will become out , those names exist David ' I have no gift ' David who had nothing to get with Ford Eater & Ford Wynorski who directed the sheer disaster that is David Eater . In fact David Eater is thus tough Wynorski hid under the pseudonym David Robertson , when a manager equally tough as Wynorski hides under a pseudonym you have the motion must be tough . Where do I still pop ? David Eater is rather only the worst picture I have seen this class & is thus tough it 's untrue , the news is tremendous , the hand is waterlogged ( at 7 level sheriff Herbert tells Kia to play him at the hospital but when they meet there later he acts surprised & says ' what exist you doing here ? ' , at 7 level sheriff Herbert triumphantly claims that we exist in 2001 twentieth 2001 & that ancient Australian Australian demons exist nonsense although actually we are in the twenty first century now , there 's a part when a woman tells in flashback the story where three men awaken the Bone Eater & it kills them but since it killed all three of them how did anyone else know about it for it to be passed down in legend ? ) & at times it gets more than a little bit embarrassing . The character 's are horrible clichés , the small town Sheriff who saves the day , his daughter becomes involved which adds some personal motivation & as for the Native Americans there 's an old wise man , a young hot head who hates ' white man ' & a young woman who is the voice of reason between the two who have names like Storm Cloud & Black Hawk . The film is as boring as hell , nothing happens , the story is awful , it 's full of plot holes & lapses in any sort of logic , the set - pieces are terrible , there 's no horror or gore or suspense or mystery & Bone Eater is just the sort of film that makes you lose the will to live . Bone Eater has some of the worst CGI computer effects I ' ve seen in a while , from the daft looking stiff moving bone eater creature itself which is just a selection of bones magically held together to a motorbike jumping a large gap to an awful CGI truck crashing over the edge of a cliff to a van being tossed to one side by the bone eater . Whenever the bone eater needs to get some speed up he causes a large horse to form from the sand & dust & rides it ! In principal this is actually quite a neat idea but it looks awful & the scenes even have cheesy cowboy music on the soundtrack ! There is one pointless scene at the end when Sheriff Evans cuts his own arm ( why ? ) & it bleeds but apart from that there is n't a single drop of blood in the thing , whenever the bone eater kills someone they usually just disappear in a cloud of dust , boring . The hilariously goofy climatic showdown between Sheriff Evans & the bone eater has to be seen to be believed , Sheriff Evans goes native on horseback complete with tribal war paint on his face while the bone eater also rides his dust horse & they have a sort of jousting contest which is just to bad to describe properly . With a supposed budget of about $ 700,000 Bone Eater is filmed in a very bland , forgettable & flat way , there 's no sense of style here at all . The majority of the film takes place in bright sunlight & if you watch it on a decent telly then the desert scenery is quite nice on occasion . There are several veteran ' known ' actors really slumming it here , Boxleitner plays exactly the same role as in the similarly themed but much better ' Creature Feature ' Snakehead Terror ( 2004 ) , William Katt will obviously put his name to any crap as long as he gets paid while ex Star Trek man Walter Koenig must be really desperate to agree to appear in this . Bone Eater is a truly atrocious ' Creature Feature ' , there 's really not much more you can say about it other than to steer well clear of it . The worst film ever to appear on the Sci - Fi Channel & that 's saying something , is n't it ? sub_rate: 0.1002921129503408; NE_rate: 0.0970873786407767
This was amongst the worst films I have ever encountered . The cinematography was ho , with long ho shots ( like a camera on a tripod filming a stage fun ) interspersed with " dramatic " angles that made little sense to the content on screen . The redaction was tremendous , scenes matched together with the delicacy of a butcher . The game hinged on the viewer being intimate with the historical night in which Mary Shelley wrote frankenstien . The acting was forced , with the type of character development that left you with an intense sake in seeing each of them die awfully ( the sooner the better ) . sub_rate: 0.07894736842105263; NE_rate: 0.0
This motion was fearful , peculiarly considering the employment that must stimulate gone into its yield . Though it 's not equally defective as Ax ' Em , it is rather fearful . subscribe into accounting the obvious countercurrent - offs from prizefighter and Raiders of the Lost ark , and what do you pose ? This variety of fearful brand - up and wooden playacting . The motion starts as most zombie movies now do . A collage of interesting parachuting - cuts and a radiocommunication program of the irruption at deal . We attend our submarine ( David , rather maybe the worst ' automaton huntsman ' in modernistic era ; counted 7 7 7 7 times where he either scratched his mind with the gun of his pistol or looked down the gun while blowing ) cutting off fingers of zombies . We afterward hear that these fingers exist collected for bounties . Well , Ford seems to be a greyback in his ways of dispensing of zombies ; going thusly far as to buy brother * pant * from his Australian chum Australian ( who is n't truly Australian , speaks with an unexpended Australian Australian Australian idiom ) . As David uses the brother to gather a bountiful bounty from India India , all perdition breaks promiscuous . And cue the horridness of the picture . The zombies exist put unitedly rather badly . I ' ve seen comments praising brand make - up , but it rather inexpert amateur in judgment opinion . 2001 Halloween adhesives were used relieve make the zombies ' faces and there were points at which daughter girl looked as if she were donning a clown alternatively instead of impudently freshly brass face David David Vey . tote hours hours hours hours upwardly up in a few lines Ford Ryn backwards back stabbed Australian Hans ( who made softwood deal with former other zombie hunters , Blythe being the ringleader ) , gives him 5th probability chance , backwards back once again Australian Hans so then Australian Hans and gets India India City where he finds Blythe is poisoning the cities for profit . That 's truly really compliments regards game plot . Ford Ryn India India City all the exist are roughly around in menage house plainly evidently thusly so massive it hours hours hours strain reach the trading floor . People die , Ryn lives , and the movie ends with one of those cynical " is he going to kill himself ? " scenes.*END SPOILERS * I ' m going to have to blame most of this mess on Nott . The direction was awful . EVERY character featured a scowl other than Hans , who was easily the best ' actor ' in this group of MacBeth rejects . When they reach Union City , a hoard of zombies attacks the crew and the zombies were obviously given no tips or ideas about how to walk as if your appendages were rotten . One woman is swaying as if she 's swimming in mid - air on a Sunday stroll . Some movies are awful . This movie is one of them simply on the grounds of how logic seemed to be abandoned in order to keep a story flowing . Works occasionally , but in this regard ( where the story was already in shambles ) , it does n't . Avoid it unless you want a decent laugh . sub_rate: 0.211340206185567; NE_rate: 0.07317073170731707
I am a usually a very generous voter on IMDb and do n't bother commenting on movies I did not like , but this was just crippled . I actually turned it off 15 minutes before finishing it , to watch " This Is It " ( because my gf wanted to ... I just chose the lesser of two evils).If you want to watch this movie : picture this film as a collection of worse - than - average " horror"-stories , like " scary short - stories " that you find in an issue of " Reader 's Digest " in the waiting room of your dentist's . I did not expect anything particular terrifying or funny , I am not the " I want to see blood!"-type of person , but this " movie " is neither " horror " nor " comedy " nor entertaining in any other way . It 's probably more scary / funny and entertaining to look at the movie - poster of " You 've Got Mail " for 90 minutes while drinking chamomile tea .

I find it disconcerting that in an era when satisfying and fulfilling spirituality is unknown and we are all scattered across the whole spectrum of possible beliefs, that a charlatan and fraud of Gurdjieff's caliber (as a charlatan, he is exceptional; there is no denying he had a special gift. It's a pity he misused it, though, for the aggrandizement of his wounded ego, feeding on the adulation of unwary sheep who were at his beck and call and in awe of him) can inspire such extreme adherence and credulity. This movie presents an idealized version of Gurdjieff's own largely fictional and fantastic account of his formation and "awakening" (which I would rather describe as his discovery of how much he could sway the minds and wills of certain types of sadly disoriented people). See it, if you dare to have a disagreeable eye-opening about how sadly deprived we are of true religious leaders, to the extent that a clown like Gurdjieff could inspire such devotion - and be careful to have your blood pressure medicine at hand if you are one of those who still hope for a healthy religion to emerge from the ruins of Christianity, as a supreme example of cinematography at the entire service of the premises and pretenses of a dysfunctional cult. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
Danny Lee 's performance as a wisecracking cop is the only spot of interest in this film , even though it has an excellent cast including Chow Yun - Fat , Carina Lau , Andy Lau , Shing Fui - On and Alex Man . CYF plays a triad boss who wants to settle down to a life of peace and plenty but Alex Man , a total psycho who has a big grudge against CYF , wo n't let him . CYF tries to escape to Malacca but to no avail . After his family is blown to bits , his cronies dead or turncoat , wounded and broke , CYF returns to Hong Kong to get into some serious revenge . It sounds a lot better than it is . CYF is well - polished and handsome , looks pained , grimaces and cries on cue , but somehow or another you just do n't care . Andy Lau looks great , but that 's about it . Carina Lau has a tiny , tiny little part which was nice , but she gets a bullet in the head early on so that ends that . Alex Man is a cartoon villain he 's so over - the - top which at times can be intriguing but the writing here is so flat that he just comes across as a garden - variety nut . Danny Lee is great though - too bad he 's only a small blip on the screen of this dark ( literally ) and essentially boring movie . Rent it , do n't buy it . Or just skip it altogether . This is the sequel to " Rich And Famous " , even though it apparently was filmed simultaneously ; it was released first because of CYF 's boxoffice power . sub_rate: 0.003236245954692557; NE_rate: 0.0
I tried . I really , really tried to think of something that would merit rating this higher than a two . It 's not that I do n't " get it " -- I 'm a big fan of Asian cinema . The truth is , the movie is infantile in construction , long - winded , and sorely disjointed . I suppose that if you are of Alfred Hitchcock 's school of thought " Do n't tell them , show them , " then you could try to appreciate this movie , but you would still be hard pressed . First of all , The Terrorizers tries stream - of - consciousness in the style of Jean - Luc Godard and fails in this . Edward Yang seems to understand the basics of the technique , but he 's very unskilled at it . ( Perhaps he gets better with age ; I do n't know as I have n't yet attempted other Yang films . ) The point is , he uses a dearth of " show , do n't tell " that really only serves to interrupt the procession of the story . Sure , he gets in some visually arresting images , but they do n't draw the story together , and they do n't help to make it any better . Additionally , the major concept behind stream - of - consciousness and " show , do n't tell " is that with the right images , the right drama , repetition , and tight correlation , the viewer will be able to make his or her own inferences ; not to say that these will be the correct inferences , but those can be amended as the story progresses , and every director should strive for some of this type of audience interaction . In this , Edward Yang sorely disappoints . The viewer is constantly on the periphery . There is no reason to be drawn in , no reason to consider the characters or their motives , no reason to get emotionally involved , and really , no reason to stay alert . Finally , Yang gets lost in the story that he wants to tell , not the story that the movie itself is telling . His art moves in one direction , but like a large dog he ca n't control , he 's constantly yanking the lead , trying to get it back onto the course he wants , not the one that it is naturally following . The most egregious example of this is the ending . The ending really should have occurred at the moment of the husband 's revelation . The ending of the book that the movie is focusing on , ( and by extension , a possible ending for the movie ) has already been told to us . If Yang had chosen to end at that point , he would have had a much more powerful piece , leaving the watcher in suspense -- does the story play out as the book says , or does Yang 's " real world " play out differently ? Asking the viewer to think about this is the sort of viewer interaction that Yang painfully needs . Instead , he continues to tell the story he wants to tell , straining the natural conclusion for the sake of what ? For the sheer sake of lingering on a main character -- we did n't ' need to know more about her superficially , and Yang would n't feel the need to tell us if he had n't made her into a veneer instead of bothering to make her a more engaging and deep character to begin with . Why else does Yang prolong and torture his movie ? To get in some more of those " visually arresting images . " The movie truly suffers for it . It wants to end , it has a conclusion that feels natural and leaves the viewer unsettled , but instead , Yang pushes on . Instead , Yang constructs a complex ending that leads the viewer on , causing him or her to constantly ask " so what ? " The first ending , the one that Yang ignored , that was good . The second ending , well , my thought was"so what , who cares ? " , because it 's not as if it is introducing something that has n't been put forth in the storyline already ... but the last ending ? That really was a waste of time . Not only did the " real " ending leave me disengaged , but I also felt it was an affront to what the story could have been . Yang sacrificed a potentially good story for the bubblegum - melancholy - noir - tinged conclusion that he had insisted upon all along . My last problem with the movie has nothing to do with the movie itself , but rather its post - production . The subbing ( if you see it subbed ) is horrible . Long sentences stay up for a second or two , while short ones stay up far too long . Also , as Yang quickly changes images , the subtitles are removed from the screen . This is one of those rare instances that subtitles should be able to stay on the screen even as the image has changed , because there 's not much dialog going on anyway . sub_rate: 0.001072961373390558; NE_rate: 0.0
I mean, come on! This movie had such nice potential but it's like they ran out of money to finish the script and just telegraphed the whole damn rest of the movie about 2/3rds of the way through. Characters start spouting this movies whole reason for existence to other characters who didn't ask for the information on extremely flimsy premises. They also fall into some stereotypical behavior because that must be what's expected in this genre of movie. It's really pretty sad because this movie could have been so much more.I was really hoping this would be a good movie. There was some good acting. Mark Hamill does an excellent job until the movie falls apart, so does Sally Struthers. It was fun to see them working and succeeding at their craft. Majandra Delfino was pretty good for awhile until her lines just became untenable. I felt sad for her that she had to say these lines that just shot the whole movies credibility for any thinking movie goers. Brad Hunt does an excellent job. He really has a surprising range of talent judging from another of his movies I recently saw, Lucky 13. (which was a piece of crap). This guy could be a star if he could pick the right scripts and get lucky with the right director.Almost forgot! The music was so heavy handed you might think this project was handed to some minor film school to be scored. I call this kind of music "Teller Music" because you can just tell what's coming next based on the music. Less is more sometimes.Cut half of the music from this movie, get a good film editor, a small rewrite or two and this would be a very good movie. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
I received a copy of this film from a friend for my 21st birthday , which he had obviously picked up for 99p from a bargain video bin . Never have I been so frustrated when watching a picture - it was ho , Adam West was wasted ( literally ) and , in retrospect , I can not recall a single thing about it .

I got interested in this movie because somebody had made a beautiful video for Björks " Bachelorette " with clips from it . So I watched the movie . And it is so stuningly beautiful . A masterpiece of animation . Unfortunately , the story does n't keep up . It starts out well , with interesting plotlines about people fencing for the possession of the Rose Bride , but suddenly elevators fill up with water and looses their walls , people float away , and finally for no reason whatsoever , Utena is tranformed into a car , and a highspeed chase ensues . I like much Anime for it 's ability to make alternative universes , but this universe is just stupid . If you are gon na watch this movie , turn of the sound , it 's better that way . sub_rate: 0.006896551724137931; NE_rate: 0.0
over , we 're getting a omnium of themes comfortably cut by thusly many premature films . The commodity and the defective boy narration , courtesy eastward of Atlantic . The Australian marine submarine narration , who does n't look himself to be one due to what he knows . And the grieving wife potentially falling in passion with another mankind news . The simple fact of those stories being that omnipresent is n't thusly much of a job though . Because theoretically they could nonetheless be better presented and dealt with each meter roughly . No fate this meter though , as all 7 of those duds finally fall monotonous all the same . As the defective boy never truly gets to babble to his father , so that dispute is never resolved decently . asunder from the father kind of starting to apprize the defective boy thanks to the latter renovating the kitchen of the grieving wife . directly , how substantial is that . Next , the astonishingly homecoming marine suspecting his wife of unfaithfulness dispute never gets resolved . Because he never truly talks to the mankind under intuition , namely his own chum . thusly formerly more we 're handed a promiscuous terminal here . And lastly , the Australian military valiancy lip composition , where the marine is publically considered a submarine when , due to the dirtiness of state he went through , he should n't very be called one as to his own standards , that 5th composition falls monotonous scarcely the same . Because the motion ends correctly when , for the 5th meter , he 's scarcely capable to babble to his wife about what he went through . Where the substantial narration would really start at that really gunpoint , namely his appendage of recuperation , how that would depend like and how he would lastly look the fellowship he 'd stimulate some major guilt to accommodate to . All that , all the truly interesting bits exist passed over and getting cut . thusly while narration impertinent this picture is a sober , and I intend sober , disappointment , I 'd however apply it points for the impressive mold . Although no picture should apply Maguire for a representative all , because that belongs to David . peculiarly a grown up Ford seems to live all the expectations he aroused as a young and aspiring actor . So much that I 'd in fact love to see him entrusted with a really deep and demanding lead role of proper profile . So while the cast really seems to do what they can , I consider this film totally forgettable otherwise . A shallow and ultimately pretentious , utterly unsatisfying tear squeezer indeed . Message du jour to the writers : we know the wounds already , see the host of Vietnam films . You want to earn some credit , show us a believable healing . sub_rate: 0.218436873747495; NE_rate: 0.03669724770642202
And also a wonderful beginning, a real quick start. It keeps you yearning and waiting for is about to come. Unfortunately the high adrenaline dries off quickly, but most certainly after half the movie is over.And it's a shame, because this movie has really good ideas and explores many of them thoroughly. But that is also one of it's faults. By exploring too many things, it get's mixed up into to many things, so in the end you're too confused to follow any plot or characters. It's very dark and moody, but that doesn't help much, if it's also genre hopping just to try to fit any- and everything in it's story! sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
The sole reason for someone wanting to see this film would be because of John Leguizamo . I remember the previews , and it looked to be another second rate comedy . But the fact that Mr. Leguizamo starred , tried to redeem it . His name , how known it was at the time or not , tried to sell it . I was somewhat disappointed with the performance of Leguizamo . His days on " House of Buggin ' " ( an " In Living Colour " clone ) , were his tip - top . There is a fine line between wackiness and idiocy , and we 'll just say that Leguizamo crossed it tenfold . He looked like he was trying to be too outrageous and crazy for the camera . As a matter of fact , I 'll say that he tried too hard . Madcap humor spilled over into imbecility , and the picture was spoiled . I ca n't say I blamed him , if you were given this opportunity , you 'd try as hard if you could , right ? Your eagerness cost you dearly though Mr. Leguizamo ... The Pest follows in the tradition of any comedy film , and plays the " race card " , and more . No group is left out from being poked fun at . Blacks , Latinos , whites , Jews , Koreans , Germans , homosexuals , and the blind are among those singled out . Again here , things get too overboard , and too much tries to get spoofed in too little time . The resolution of the film takes all of five minutes to clear up and move back to normality . When you have a film , and you 're going to bypass game and reality for comedy 's sake , just progress sure it 's funny , or all you have is hours hours of witless film . Which would sum up Leguizamo 's " Pest " quite nicely ... sub_rate: 0.023323615160349854; NE_rate: 0.125
When my parents rented this movie , I was expecting a very funny movie as Randy Quaid is very funny in comedy movies . However , this movie is not all that funny and it is somewhat boring too . You can see the surprise coming a mile away and it runs long for a movie that is supposedly only eighty one minutes long . So I can honestly say it is not a movie that is on my favorites list . It may work for some people , but it just did not work with me at all proving to be rather slow in the build - up with virtually nothing that amused me within the entire movie . Randy Quaid is wasted and the rest of the cast is a list of very flat actors and actresses . The premise of the movie had potential , as did the casting of Quaid , but all of it just sputters and the inclusion of the horror element exactly seems very unneeded . Granted , the one dream sequence the kid had when he jumped on the bed and it suddenly became a whirlpool of stock was very nicely done and would have worked very well in a movie that was supposed to be pure horror , instead of one that lists comedy as its first genre . sub_rate: 0.017543859649122806; NE_rate: 0.0
Rarely does one find a movie so defective that it achieves the often - sought paradigm of having so little redeeming value that that alone makes it worth watching . " Cyclone , " I am happy to report , is such a film . I knew I was in for something good as soon as I found the videotape . I am at least its fourth owner : It has a " Used Movie Sale ! $ 9.95 " sticker on the front , and a yard - sale sticker for one dollar . I picked it up at a thrift store for fifty cents . The Used Movie Sale ! sticker covers much of the front cover artwork , meaning that what I see is a truly odd blended still of the front of the Cyclone super bike , a car flipping over on fire , and Heather Thomas , wearing Flouncy Eighties Hair with her mouth open in an expression that says , " I ' ave a ' ooth ache . " I saw that and thought , " All RIGHT . " The case , honestly , was enough ( " with nowhere to turn and no one to trust , Teri is plunged headlong into a maze of danger and deceit " ) , but I surprised myself by actually getting around to watching it . I always make time for the really bad films . That " Fight Club " tape can wait . Meet Teri . Teri is a stunningly well - crafted character , as we can tell from her introduction , in which she and her friend do exercises that highlight her breasts and , later , her legwarmers . Then Teri goes off to hook up with her boyfriend for the evening that goes horribly wrong . Before she knows it , Teri is driven " straight into a web of deadly double - crosses in CYCLONE . " The VHS box tells it like it is . Left out of the box summary - perhaps out of some faint hope that actual copies of this film would be sold - is how fearful the acting is . It might have been just me , but I kept thinking I could read the characters ' thoughts through their eyes . " This is dense , " thinks Heather Thomas . " I know , " thinks Bad Guy with Too - Wide Mouth . A driving force ( no pun intended ) for the second half of this epic picture are the car chases . Those were actually pretty good , although I ' m inclined that gasoline does n't need coaching on how to explode . What really impressed me is that , in all the chases , the streets were pretty much empty . It 's like there are only twenty people in this huge city . I know what you 're thinking . You 're thinking , " Gee Wilikers ! I have to see this movie ! " The sad thing , though , is that you ca n't find it . Oh no . " Cyclone " is a film that finds YOU . Just wait . Some day - perhaps during lunch , perhaps late in the evening , perhaps " when military scientist Jeffery Combs ( ' Re - Animator')is murdered by hired assassins " - you will hear the rustle of legwarmers , and know that it is time . sub_rate: 0.00510204081632653; NE_rate: 0.0

... I normally hate puns , but this seems the only appropriate summary for " Barnyard " . I suspect I am not the first . And I ' m sure many , MANY comments focus on the idiocy of bulls with udders . It certainly bothered me right off the bat . But there 's much more wrong with this movie than a fundamental lack of knowledge about how mammals work . Personally , if I was a parent , I would be irritated by the violent turn it takes near the end in the showdown with the coyotes . ( Although for me , it at least injected a little action . ) And from a conventional screen writing point of view , you might expect the coyotes to play a greater role in the conflict(Gee- you have a " widow " cow ... maybe her " husband " was killed by coyotes ? Nope ... there 's a much dumber explanation . ) And what kind of a farm is this ? Otis vows to protect all the animals from harm , but there certainly seems to be no threat from humans . They make reference to the farmer being vegan , but what is he raising pigs for ? In all children 's animal stories- Babe , Charlotte 's Web , you name it ... the reality of farm life is at least touched on . Perhaps our friendly farmer is running some sort of rescue shelter ( there is some reference to this , but it 's never explained . ) But all the farmer gets in return is abuse from a horse in a scene that is supposed to be funny , but left me seriously wondering if he was going to wind up buried in a shallow grave behind the barn . And what the heck is the deal with " Wild Mike " ? It was like the scenery scene in Pulp Fiction without the ball - gag . Add in really truly amazing attempts at emotional scenes , a perfect complete lack of laughs , and THOSE UDDERS , and you ' ve got the worst kids movie I ' ve seen in ages . I generally only post to IMDb to highlight a film that 's not so well known- not to slam the current # 2 box - office hit . But this movie ANGERED me . It was taking up space in my local theater , space that could have been used to show something worthwhile . There 's been plenty of good family entertainment this summer- in fact there were at least 2 more kids films playing at the same multiplex . But I ' m not allowed to see something like " Little Miss Sunshine " so Viacom can cheat families out of an extra $ 30 . At least I had a free pass . I know that as a 35 year old with no children , this film was not designed for me . But there 's just no excuse for such a lazy , dreadful children 's film as " Barnyard " in the age of Pixar . I was bored by the " Ice Age " films , but they certainly did n't anger me like " Barnyard " . " Shark Tale " was a weak attempt at street hipness , but it had quite a few laughs . For that matter , you could turn on Nickelodeon at any time of the day , and see something more entertaining and intelligent- which is why they should be ashamed for putting their name on this garbage . I ' m giving it a 2 out of 10 , only because Pip The Mouse was sporadically amusing , and Maria Bamford had a few amusing lines as the farmers wife . Well , not THE farmer 's wife . Some other farmer . They did n't really explain who she was . They did n't explain a lot of things . Especially not why Sam Elliot- the ultimate " man 's man"- had an udder jiggling around down there . Creepy . sub_rate: 0.005763688760806916; NE_rate: 0.0
28 years before 9/11, there was another 9/11 which represented a key date in the history of Chile, South America and the whole world. This was the date in 1973 when a bloody coup in Chile deposed Salvador Allende the first Marxist president elected democratically anywhere in the world and put an end to the Chilean experiment of a democratic transition from capitalism to socialism. Allende committed suicide when the armed forces attacked the presidential palace.Unfortunately this film is too biased and too nostalgic towards the time of Allende's rule to be an objective rendition of the man and of his place in history. The times were troubled and Allende was a disputed figure in the history of his country and of the whole world. True, he was democratically elected, but his policies plunged Chile into economic crisis. He was deposed by a coup and a right-wing dictatorship followed with repression and flagrant human rights abuses, but he was also an ally of Castro who saw in his policies another way of making revolution. We'll never know if his tentative to build a socialist yet democratic society would have succeeded. The authors of the movie take a completely pro-Allende position, there is no opinion or point of view trying to explain the other side, to answer questions like why did the middle class oppose him, or how his democratic views could go together with supporting or being supported by Castro. The tone of the commentaries is nostalgic and apologetic, almost propagandistic. People who want to get a better understanding of this episode of the history need to wait for a more balanced and objective film or book in the future. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0

OK , we were going along with the stereotypical tough orphanage experience and explaining to our son , adopted from Russia , that this was over - the - top acting and dramatization , so we could get to the dog playing soccer ( since he plays soccer ) . But the last scene , in which the dog goes back to his original owner put my son over the edge and he cried for 15 - 20 minutes , " he 's been replaced ! ! ! ! " This from an elementary child . I DO NOT recommend this movie to any family that has an adopted child ; it displays adoption , orphanages and adults disadvantageously -- and in the end , even though they win the game -- the dog that the boy bonded with has to leave -- and this is too much . PLEASE be wary if you have any adopted children , and beware families with biological children , because the impression of children who are adopted is not positive and paints a stereotype that is unhealthy and filthy .

This movie is essentially a " how - to " on how to be a well - connected pedophile . I ' m amazed that so many people-- especially other gay men-- have seen this movie and read the book and no one has brought up the fact that if Weber was not an influential photographer , he would be in jail , doing time for child abuse . Poor Peter Johnson . Weber took short poor , naive ( although incredibly handsome ) teenager whom he found at a training camp for high school wrestlers in the Midwest , brought him to live in his home , and took thousands of homoerotic photos of him , many of them full - frontal nudes , all through Johnson 's teenage years . That ai n't art . It 's child abuse . And what 's worse , Weber made lots of money off of it , and poor Johnson is going to have serious " issues " the rest of his life . Weber 's lecherous love of the boy is downright creepy , as are his ramblings about famous ( and not so famous ) people he 's known , as he tries to complete Johnson 's " education . " Creepy , and hardly apparently plain ho . The only redeeming thing I can say about the movie is that it is a fascinating study of self - deception .

I enjoy science-fiction just as much as the next man but what the hell was that? Apparently shot over just three days using excess film stock left over from his previous film, 'Nana (1926),' this Jean Renoir short is a bewildering futuristic satire, produced on a budget that couldn't have been much more than zero. In the year 2028, following a great war, Africa has become the most civilised region on Earth, and what was formerly Europe has been designated "Terres Inconnues (Unknown Land)." An African explorer  played by Johnny Huggins, a Black man dressed up as a White man dressed up as a Black man, if you follow me  travels to the ruins of Paris in his spherical aircraft, and lands outside the lair of a Parisian savage (Catherine Hessling, then the director's wife) and her primate companion, perhaps the creepiest ape-man costume I've ever seen. The savage, as part of some bizarre sexual initiation ritual, starts showing the explorer the Charleston dance, which he is delighted to learn himself.It doesn't help the film that Hessling, who was wonderful the following year in Renoir's 'The Little Match Girl (1928),' isn't much of a dancer, though the extensive use of slow-motion adds a touch of surrealism to the ceremony. Furthermore, I'm quite shocked that Renoir would exploit his own wife as such a blatant sexual object  it doesn't come as a surprise to learn of their divorce just three years later! On the plus side, I did like the general sci-fi concept behind the film, and the slyly satiric touch of the reversing the racial roles usually typical in such stories as this. However, why Renoir decided to dress up his Black actor as a minstrel will remain a mystery for all of time. Silly, crude and quite pointless, 'Charleston Parade (1927)' is a cinematic oddity from one of cinema's most respected directors, and is perhaps an effort that he would have liked to forget. The DVD version came without a musical soundtrack, but I compromised with a selection of pieces from Dmitri Shostakovich. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
Well , i must admit , when i saw the trailer for this movie , i was looking forward to it . I am loosely a fan of light hearted romantic comedies and from the trailer , that s the impression i got of this movie . However , i spent most of the movie waiting for the comedy to begin . Although there were a couple of amusing scenes , in general the outlook of the picture was rather depressing . I also found it difficult to fall in love with any of the characters as they all seemed a little underdeveloped , the time which the director could have used exploring the characters taken up by a uncalled overuse of Opera , making the movie feel dragged out and slow . All in all , although there are some touching scenes , the trailer is quite deceptive and i would only suggest you go watch this if there is genuinely zip else that tickles your fancy .

These writers are trying to re - create the characters they have on " scrubs " in a different occupation however the characters they are stuck with have no charisma or acting ability not to mention the writing seems inadequate and effortless . These guys are trying to create something that would be good if the writing was n't thus skanky which is leaving the shows only lifeline to be two attractive teachers that that are barely keeping it alive . The humor in this show seems like it is trying to target an audience with an I.Q. of 40 or below . Another reason why this show is becoming a failure could be that the writing on the show " scrubs " is excellent and this show has to follow it up leaving the viewer in an odd position not knowing whether to cry or to just lose hope in new sitcoms all together . This is just my opinion but i think these guys should stop now before they humiliate themselves anymore than they have already . sub_rate: 0.01675977653631285; NE_rate: 0.0
There are three main problems with the film . Or rather there are three reasons why it is n't even a contender worthy of more serious consideration . Firstly , and this was always going to be true , it 's not nearly as good as the books . However , at least we could have expected to reflect some of the Sapkowski 's wit or depth . Secondly we have the production . Fantasy movies are , in my opinion , the hardest to produce well . Everything from the props through costumes , scenery , stunts and ( especially ) CGI is substandard . Finally , and this is many be very subjective , I just ca n't quite learn the acting seriously . I was n't brought up in Poland so I ca n't really judge- it may me my lack of familiarity with films in polish . All the same the lines seem very amateurishly delivered ... The casting could be better as well . In summation , the only possible redeeming feature of this film is the remainder of the plot shining through : not unlike a diamond ring on a rotting cadaver . On a separate note I heard that the books are coming out in English . I have n't seen them yet but I ca n't imagine how one would even begin to translate them ... I would ask the English - speaking reader to bare this in mind when judging the book . sub_rate: 0.003968253968253968; NE_rate: 0.0

H.G. Wells is spinning . No doubt about it . Really , this would have been a decent sci - fi / adventure movie , if it had n't been based on a classic novel and directed by the author 's grandson . I kept hearing about how this would be the definitive version of the novel . What resulted was a wretched and simpleminded bastardization . The novel is a great sci - fi story but what a lot of people miss when they read it ( probably because they read it when they 're very young ) is that it 's overflowing with social commentary . The Eloi and Morlocks are a satire of the class distinctions of Victorian England , and the overall message of the film is that EVERYTHING DECAYS AND DEGENERATES , a satiric jab at Victorian complacency and their belief that their civilization would last forever . There 's no love story , no romance with a beautiful Eloi woman .... in the novel , the Eloi are 3-foot - tall childlike beings with a mental capacity not far above that of an animal . The Time Traveler does befriend an Eloi woman but it 's clear he thinks of her more like a pet , and anyway she 's killed before the novel ends . This movie first tries to give us a totally unintelligent backstory as to " why he wants to travel through time . " The treacly romance and the Lessons He Must Learn are enough to make film fans vomit . The journey into the future is punctuated by a future disaster . OK , not bad , but it would have had more punch if we had been allowed to see that mankind just generally degenerates , as in the book . More a reflection of the times , I guess , as the George Pal version had a nuclear war take place . The general story ? Ugh . A total misrepresentation of the novel . The Eloi are too competent and warlike . The Morlocks are too intelligent . The UberMorlock is an superfluity , and there 's no setup . He just shows up in time to be killed . Yawn . Samantha Mumba does OK . Guy Pearce is one of my favorites but he often seems confused and in pain . ( Reportedly he broke a rib while filming this . ) He also looks unhealthy and overly thin , as if he had been ill for a long time before making this .

An wild , unfledged boy in a big humanity 's eubstance , packing all the charisma of a tilt , he goes close to shoes most masses would just wish to travel and does his best to be equally low as potential . fall this task to soul else who really appreciates it . I could die down an interminable inclination of all the unintelligent things this guy does in his " episodes , " though I 'll exactly play the worst : Ford . While the locals exist putting up seaside picnics in his " pureness , " this clown has the freshness to move like a testy , bad kid . He complains about everything , including the manner horse of the masses who exist there . What an imbecile . When he went to India , he spent hours hours hours hours feigning disbelief at a lot of chefs ( who likely had better things to serve than speak with some dimwit Australian , like body ) because they did n't believe David was ugly . all he went , he brought up David . This is the variety of lecture you 'd learn from 13-year - olds who watch also often MTV.When he was in India India , he got confused that a sure eatery had better - tasting chips than his , then he " unintentionally " spilled some wine on them in society to break them . What a unusual , emotionally unsound soul . The worst of it all exist his incompetent part - overs , where he attempts in futile to bring some variety of view on a office he was also deep and unwitting to take . He tries to apply all these " great " Logos in society to go like an writer , but he 's actually exactly a ostentatious taxi whose deficiency of sentience has convinced him he has something to sound . That , by the path , is likely the 7 honest affair about this joker 's television display . It goes to prove you , no matter how inept you exist , equally long as you involve yourself badly enough , the humanity will equally easily . so there 's the manner he speaks with local guides whose Portuguese is apparently solely fundamental . He 'll use vocabulary any writer -- as he believes himself to be -- would instinctively know will most likely not be understood by these people . Does he care ? No . Self - important schmucks like this Bourdain clown do not use language to communicate ; they use it to make themselves look important . Mcg13jthm 's review on this same page is a perfect example of the kind of mind Bourdain attracts -- that of a low IQ social misfit . Observe how the reviewer attempts to justify Bourdain 's sociopath nature with simple - minded , childish excuses that hardly make sense . " Bourdain may complain but he goes through ' a lot ' and , not only that , he was ' forced ' to do this show but is trying to redeem himself . " A dolt attracts dolts , and reading Mcg13jthm 's review should let you know perfectly well whether or not you are the kind of person who 'd enjoy this utterly useless , pointless show . Finally , to add a bit of " fairness " to my diatribe , I admit Bourdain would have been momentarily amusing had I met him in a bar . But as a TV host of a travel show whose purpose is to show the viewer the beauty of other places and cultures , Bourdain is a miserable , abject , hopeless , grim and depressing failure . A failure . sub_rate: 0.18575851393188855; NE_rate: 0.03333333333333333
While the new Pride & Prejudice film is gorgeous to view, and the soundtrack is lovely, we are not seeing Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. The film is for some reason set back in the early 1790's, rather than the Regency period where the novel is set, as scholars have long shown. The Bennets' Longbourn estate is ram-shackled and looks like Cold Comfort Farm. Yet the Bennets in the novel are gentry class; they own a farm, but the pig does not walk through the house, nor is the farmyard of manure and chicken droppings contiguous to the home. Scenes are re-set from the novel,and lest we forget, Jane Austen placed scenes in certain locations for a reason. For example, the film puts the big Darcy proposal scene outside in a storm in front of a Neoclassical temple, as opposed to inside the Collins' parsonage: Why did Jane Austen put it in the parsonage? Because while Lizzy and Darcy speak with total, if brutal honesty to each other in this scene, the Collinses have never shared an honest word. Why the rain and the outdoor proposal? It looks like Jane Eyre meeting Rochester! And when Elizabeth walks across a windy field to stand on a cliff and view the panorama, one expects her to cry, "Heathcliffe" at any minute! Austen has been Bronteized! Judy Dench is a GREAT actress, but Lady Catherine is supposed to be tall and striking. The petite Tom Hollander is a brilliant actor: but Mr. Collins is described in the novel as tall and heavy-looking, which suggests that his terrible dancing with poor Lizzy is elephantine. Matthew MacFayden is another favorite of mine from MI-5 on A&E; in P&P, however, he is more the young Heathcliffe, never smiling--though Austen observes in the novel that Darcy smiles at Lizzy quite a bit, and she realizes this when she sees his wonderful smiling portrait at Pemberley--a portrait that in this movie is for some reason replaced by a sculptured marble bust.And much of Austen's dialogue is changed to modern speech. Mr. Bingley has been turned into such a clown that one wonders why Darcy would have him as a friend and why Jane Bennet would love him. The bottom line is that while this is a great movie to watch and hear, it deviates from Jane Austen's novel so much that any student who watched it, thinking she could substitute viewing for reading, would fail! sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
I have never felt the need to add a review to this website until now , but having just sat through the film I felt it necessary to warn parents who may be thinking of showing it to their children . Please do n't ! This is no Disney film . This film tells us ' life is cruel ' and if you show it to your children , in my opinion , you are too . The video box describes the film as a ' delight for all ages ' and the IMDb plot outline describes it as a ' family film ' . I just had to find a definition of ' family film ' and came across the following : " Usually consisting of comedies or adventures , these films are often based on children 's literature and can involve any number of helpful animals , friendly supernatural beings and fantasy worlds , all geared to stimulate and appeal to the imagination . Whatever the situation , there is little or no offensive material and generally a lesson is learned on the way . " Not an apt description of Tarka The Otter , which contains some soundly unpleasant scenes , totally unsuitable for young children , and an ending that qualifies the film as a ' feel high ' movie . The lesson learned ? As I said : life is brutal . Family entertainment ? I do n't think so . Unless you hate your family , that is .

Naach A more detailed review can be obtained anywhere else in the web. This one is a good portrayal, although I do not agree with it entirely. Taran is a commercial guy and hence views from his angle only.Ram Gopal Varma (RGV, seems like a political party) has created a marvel in Rangeela, so this one seems like a pale reflection of that one in some parts... I'm not even going to compare Urmila and Anthara.. both are good! The former has better acting talent, although the latter is catching up nicely.Anyways, I like Anthara's character. She is true to her art, not touched by any unnecessary emotion and definitely not too practical. She is a dance scientist, actually she is so sure of her theories that even comparing her to a scientist would offend her. Hey.. Donald Trump.. maybe you gotta ditch Melania, here is Anthara and you've already built a Taj Mahal... ain't this easy? Abhishek on the other hand is a practical fellow, who wants money, power, fame, etc. Hence these two albeit were struggling to get a break into the film industry, cannot get along, given their different styles and approach to life. This is very typical, but what I like about the movie is that it says what an Abhimaan would say in its total runtime, in one scene! What's new? This movie takes a different angle to the film industry and how different people get into it. There is always something different about RGV's movies, this one is different too, it is way too slow for his standards. In parts, it drags one almost to sleep.Noticeable It is tough to notice anything other than Anthara in the first half of the movie. I think this skin show was necessary for the dance sequences involved :-) Also, looks like Anthara is a pro in Yoga, she is way too flexible, almost like a Prabhu Devi. Aby Baby is improving as an actor with every movie. I am sure his filmstar blood is paying off rich dividends. The title song was really good, the music overall was above average. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
This puddle of derivative drool stole from every Soviet film of note and failed miserably . I was left with an experience of everything that is wrong with organized religion in general and the Russian Orthodox Church 's particular shortcomings ( mind you this comment comes from a person of faith ) . Even the outstanding cinematography left me uninventive . I spent its most beautiful moments very aware of the masterworks that it was poorly imitating . I would not recommend seeing this movie unless you have a deep passion for the Russian Orthodox Church , its monastic traditions , miracles in the face of Communism , and Saints of the Seventies . It is a nonmeaningful film from ( and about ) a narrow perspective that did absolutely nothing for me . sub_rate: 0.022388059701492536; NE_rate: 0.0
It's nice to see Julie Andrews trying a straight dramatic role here--something she hadn't done in awhile--but her character of Judith(wise they didn't try to pass her off as a 'Judy')has the old refined manners and tomboyish hairstyle of yore, and Andrews enacts 'grown-up' as any other actress would interpret frigid. It's a surprisingly bland drama set in Barbados involving Omar Sharif(not the liveliest leading man around--not even in 1974!)hoping to make Andrews a spy while also slowly leading her into the proverbial bedroom. Unmemorable outing does have some camp value: the James Bond-like credits at the beginning are a cheesy hoot. As for Julie: she's quiet and contemplative, but that doesn't do much for the audience, or for the film. Blake Edwards paces the freakin' thing like a funeral. * from **** sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
WARNING!!! SOME POSSIBLE PLOT SPOILERS, AS IF THAT WAS POSSIBLE!!!Okay, if you haven't figured out the plot yet, I am going to give it to you. Two couples head out to a camping site, but a clown masked killer shows up and causes all sorts of mayhem.Now it is time for me to give these couples some advice.1. Never, ever go to camp dubbed Camp Blood by the locals. 2. Don't have sex or make out in front of the killer. 3. Don't go chasing after the killer if he or she runs away. 4. Don't yell profanity at the killer. 5. Make sure your cellular phone works before you go camping. 6. Everybody needs to bring a sharp or dangerous weapon and carry it on themselves at all times. 7. Wear loose and comfortable clothing and bring a good pair of running shoes. No tight and binding clothing and no high heels or sandals. 8. Wear glasses or contact lenses if you need them so you don't stab the wrong person. 9. Always carry your car keys on you. 10. Put out a camp fire when you go to bed. 11. Watch your step. If you trip on something, your going to break a bone. 12. Check the backseat for uninvited guess. 13. If the killer has you cornered, at least put up a struggle.And guess what? At least one, but usually all four of the main characters breaks all of these common sense rules. They are the dumbest characters ever to grace a film.Now for some brief comments. This slasher film was on a very tight budget. So low four of the 7 or 8 actors play more than one role. The acting, writing, direction, sound, lighting, camera work, plotting, editing, etc. are all bottom of the line. But like the classic film JACK O this works on a sooooooooo bad, it is very entertaining and campy fun level. So rent this and have a good time and laugh. My rating: 5 out of 10. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
I watched this with great trepidation, and my trepidation was well founded, it seems. What was this movie about? Knight? The season? The Players? What? It was all over the place all the time. It had no tension (sorry, we all knew Bobby was going to curse and throw things) but Brian Denehy, a fine actor, comes across as mailing in the anger and delivering zero tension. Cheaply shot, like a MacGiver episode. Contrast this Thanksgiving main course with the job HBO did on the Don King movie "only in America" to show how to do sports biopics, warts and all. Notice that ESPN promoted the hell out of it and then never showed it again? sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0

tremendous direction from an amazing script . Even the DVD looked muddy and out of focus . Laughable accents all over the map . Unlike most of the other commenters I had no idea this was about boys in love in the mud , but that fact became immediately obvious from the opening scene and all the lovingly drawn - out shots of nude or scantily - clad young men , usually wet or glistening with sweat , looking longingly at each other . sub_rate: 0.023809523809523808; NE_rate: 0.0
A new guard in in the armored truck gig is recruited by his co - workers to steal 7 million from the truck . No defective guys , so no one will get hurt , right ? Of course things go faulty and the new guard decides to stimulate a sense and make things right by saving the life of a dying mankind . I 'll admit that I did n't really have any interest in this film , but I did stimulate have any interest in Fantastic Mr Fox either , and that film made my top ten of the year . Armored is even more of a disappointment then I thought it would be . As a heist film , it fails to deliver the goods , it 's irksome and full of plot holes and leaps in logic that one will hurt themselves thinking about it . Despite this the film somehow has a really great cast , but the film does n't apply use this to it 's advantage . Everyone seems wasted in wooden characters that unintelligent stupid choices David Columbus Short is an pencil lead that is never charismatic and never makes consultation audience want to give dogshit crap . David Dillon is genius mastermind behind the heist and he Mister Mr. Nice Guy at first , then when things do n't go his way he quickly becomes the villain . The rest of the impressive cast include David Fisburn , David Reno David David Ulrich , Fred Ward Ford Ford Nolasco from Prison Break David David Ventimiglia India Heros . Non of them do much and when they actually do something , it 's without much reasoning behind it . The film is relatively short , but even with it 's meter time under 90 minutes , it felt dragged out . How long can relieve make a nigh about a guy trapped somewhere ? Phonebooth did a occupation job and it was even more restricted . The leaps of logic concerning game plot here tragical tragic 7 42 million and all the security they have are check ins every hour thusly so ? intact entire plan from my understanding was to drive the trucks into an abandoned warehouse blot hide the money . Pretend to get hit incinerate burn the trucks . They would then walk away with the money . Of course something goes wrong , or there would be no movie right ? Through a series of unfortunate events out so called hero has trapped himself inside the truck with an injured officer . The rest of the movie is Dillion and his crew banging on the doors to get in . How very exciting . The script calls for our hero to have financial problems , he might lose his house , which would in turn make him lose his brother . You see , both their parents died and it 's just the two of them looking out for each other . So now he has a reason to join the heist . At first he did n't want in , but his money problems is just the right push to throw him in the thick of things . How convenient . Armored 's whole spin on the heist genre is that it 's from an armored truck , from the guys who drive it . After that basic premise , the film falls flat on it 's face . I found myself wanting it to end sooner and sooner each time someone spoke . Speaking of the ending , it sucks . Skip it . sub_rate: 0.060955518945634266; NE_rate: 0.10810810810810811
Ill - conceived sequel( .. the absurd idea of having the killer snowman on the rampage at an island resort where there is no snow or cold weather)brings back the spirit of the psychopath , returning thanks to a scientific experiment providing foreign elements which reintroduce life to his molecules( .. it 's the best I could do to explain this preposterous concept).I could go into depth about how he winds up at the island in order to slay numerous tourists , but I simply find no reason to bother because it 'd all be so exhausting . Anyway , the filmmakers think it wise to kill off the pretty girls not ten minutes after their arrival( .. I mean seriously , why worry with even introducing them to us if we ca n't enjoy our eye candy no longer that this?!).The " snow anvil " murder scene takes the cake . Ice icicles protrude from the beach 's sand so that a victim can fall on them . Oh , and another girl is stabbed with a pair of weenie tongs . Look I get what 's coming to me when I sit down to watch a killer snowman movie .. such a ridiculous supernatural slasher will either tickle your funnybone("Oh , it 's such a wonderfully cheesy horror movie!")or have you pondering why the hell you 're wasting time with such nonsense . Jack Frost has the power to freeze water( .. then how were they able to melt him in the first film?)and causes the island resort to snow . One sequence has Jack freezing pool water , encasing a swimming model under the sheet , result being her drowning with nowhere to escape . Oh , there 's also a recreation of the " tongue stuck to the icy pole " bit from The Christmas Story("Cowatonga dude!").I got ta hand it to the cast , though .. they're real troopers for trying to make this wretched material entertaining . Christopher Allport( .. perhaps unwisely)returns as Sam , to face his old nemesis , as does Eileen Seeley , as his wife . The attempts at tongue - in - cheek humor( .. for me , at least ) fell flat , but the cast soldiers ahead trying to make the most of a very difficult situation , with spirited performances they do their best to rise above the pitiful premise and woeful dialogue . A development occurs which increases the danger towards those still around to face off with Jack , his genetically altered water molecules , thanks to the introduced foreign elements , allow him to withstand coolant / anti - freeze , and , even worse , he now can reproduce .. through indigestion , Jack hacks up what appear to be snowballs which hatch to reveal little snowballs with black eyes , mouth and sharp teeth ! The killer snowman costume and little snowball puppets introduced later in the film might produce belly - laughs if you are in the mood for such shenanigans , but I personally found this junk rather hokey( .. that 's the purpose behind it , I suppose , cheap guffaws from those willing to embrace this)and unbearable . The snowball offspring is an obvious homage to Gremlins where we get a bar scene where the little bastards are celebrating in number over terrorizing victims at the resort . The weapon against them .. bananas ! It 's explained that when Jack went to kill Sam in the first film , both fell in a truck bed full of anti - freeze( .. an icicle emerging from Jack 's belly was penetrating Sam 's chest when he pushed them out a window into the truck bed , and I guess in their being " being linked " by the icicle , Jack inherited Sam 's banana allergy , or so this is what we are led to believe!)and in doing so both " merged " in a sense . Phew , such a film as this defies simple explanation . It 's a film with effects and plot so terrible , one might find the presentation enjoyable because of it 's many failings . sub_rate: 0.00141643059490085; NE_rate: 0.0

This show can most accurately be described as TV Bubble-Gum: It's chewing, it has a good taste to it, and it lasts a long time. But, like Bubble-Gum, it can leave a bad taste in your mouth after a few too many chews.This show features very simple questions that take the form of simply games, like Hangman, guessing a simple phrase or guessing items on a short list. Callers are the contestants, and anybody can play.The questions, though, are terribly easy. There's some techno music pumped into the background that's fashioned into a continuous loop. It never seems to get old, but it never adds much to the show anyway. The hostess, however, regardless of which one that it, is extremely personable, pleasant enough to watch and can make some very amusing facial expressions. I rather enjoy that British woman.But there's nothing to this show. It's simplistic and uncompelling, although it can be entertaining if absolutely nothing else is on. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0

I 'm going to talk about this movie from two different perspectives here . First is from the view of if someone sees the movie and never read ( and may not ever read ) the book . The second is from someone who has.(Movie without book ) From a movie standpoint , it was an fine movie . Nowhere near as good as either of the Underworlds but much better than UltraViolet . And I 'm not just talking plot line either . The visual effects were iffy in many of the parts , though the wolf transformation was very nice . The characters has very little development and Vivian did n't even seem to truly care that her " love " was killing off what was left of her species . Some of the other characters could have had more air - time , like The Five . The plot was way to similar to Underworld for my tastes.(Movie WITH book ) As many have stated , other than the title , character names and a few minor parts , the movie and the book are nothing alike . In the movie , Gabriel was a lot older and was the father of Rafe ( thus Astrid was once his mate ) . In the book , Gab was about 24 , never mated with anyone since wolves mate for life ( Astrid is trying to win his affection ) and Astrid was the mother of Ulf , not Rafe . Another important thing is the location . The book took place in Riverview , Maryland . Also , why they moved from West Virginia is very different . The movie has it being Vivian 's fault and her entire family was killed due to it . In the book , the original leader of The Five , named Axel , killed a girl from their school . Hunters tracked down the wolves and killed many of them ( Viv 's father included ) , forcing them to move . Also , Viv 's mom , Esme was a major character . One thing from the book that would have made the movie better would have been the " bitch 's dance " . For those who do n't know , it 's the ordeal where all the bitches ( females of the pack ) fight to see who is the one to be the mate of the new leader ( since earlier there was a fight for the males ) . Vivian won it , trying to save her mother from Astrid ( who is a horrid evil woman in the book ) and thus was supposed to mate with Gab . There was no prophecy ! Anyway , if you 've read the book and you liked the book , I highly suggest NOT seeing this film . sub_rate: 0.002074688796680498; NE_rate: 0.0
I will not vote this movie as an amazing one , mainly because i kind of like it , i was one of those summer days that i was thus crippled to do anything and decided do rent a movie in the stupid section of the videostore . Besides that i did n't slept in the nigh before and the movie got me awake ... Let 's just start the autopsy , OK , the movie haves a strange plot , first is isolation , there is an pleasure , they get isolated in an island because there is no gas on the boat , something like that , there is not a single convincing performance on the actors part(so far ) , the main problem starts after the isolation idea , the POV of a snake , then another , ... then another , then snakes that change , then false spooks , a lot of them , and when we believe the movie is going on a good way for a b flick keeping the suspense it fails , because after ten or eleven spooks we do n't get carried away , the one scene that unmistifies all is the scene when we witness a drunk lesbian show watched by snakes that seem to dance , after this it 's becoming not a horror\adventure but a comedy driven movie , the adventure part is discarded also . For me the problem in a movie is the third act , it is the one section that just drives the movie for a already guessed conclusion , or if it succeeds we do n't noticed it , like a ninja smoke in our eyes , well .... Snake island haves a bad conclusion , it all comes to a « by the book » ending , with a confront , persecution and escape sequence , it was predictable in the moment i rented the dam copy . The other real problem is concept , concept is very important , it is the reason you believe in dinosaurs coming to life or a corpse full of stitches that just wants to live , the main concept about snakes that want revenge after decades on torture by the human civilization , well ... hmmm , just doesen't glues on the wall . One thing you will enjoy ( if you watch it with an opened mind ) is the more b - z sequences , naked lesbian girls , some amateur camera angles , the braindead homage with the grass cutter , the black dude doesen't die first , and that s all ... if you want to see snakes , black dudes and comedy and you prefer bigger budgets go and see « snakes on a plane » .

God bless Randy Quaid ... his leachorous Cousin Eddie in Vacation and Christmas Vacation uproariously stole the show . He even made the tremendous Vegas Vacation at least worth a look . I will say that he tries hard in this made for TV sequel , but that the book is so Ford funny that the movie never really gets anywhere . Quaid and the rest of the returning Vacation vets ( including the orginal Audrey , Dana Barron ) exist wasted here . still European Vacation 's Eric Idle can not save the show in a brief cameo .... wretched and sad ... actually painful to watch .... Christmas Vacation 2 is the worst of the David franchise . sub_rate: 0.06666666666666667; NE_rate: 0.125
Though I have watched Salò , I do not know if excrement tastes tart . If it does , this " film " is accurately titled . So much of roughage , so little substance , this is the celluloid equivalent of celery - only it does not cleanse the palate . It leaves the taste of wasted time in the mind 's mouth , and if I could vomit this film and get back that expanse / expense I would . Detention was more exciting . The director should be forced to wear a dunce cap , and the Spirit of Ed Wood Jr. could n't save this semi - professional projection from certain failure . A dissipation of time , a dissipation of mind . * * Do n't be fooled by the toothsome Dominique Swain : competent eye - candy she was in the Lolita remake , less tragic and savvier than Sue Lyon , though by no means better . However , a previously competent turn of the screw does not make her a skilled crafts - person . You need craft for that , not crap , which is what this film is . The reels belong in the girls ' bathroom , flushed till the pipes burst , while director / direct - less Christina Wayne should do 5 - 10 in study hall . Watch anything else and pass this class , by ( bye ) , forever ! sub_rate: 0.008130081300813009; NE_rate: 0.0
To visit a picture oil is not something I would normally look as a valid criticism . nonetheless , when a picture is crassly made of free parts from former films that were n't that honest to get with , and it is ho as molasses with no actual reward , I intend it 's clean to send a spade a spade . And The touch is a really ho movie . A picture that is well equally original as its ' figure , The touch tells the news of a untried daughter with blackout being haunted by a ghost that holds the mystery to her yesteryear . just , it 's a solid fortune more complicated and less interesting than one would believe . The game phone is nearly uncomprehensible for most of the painting and the hooking , the blackout factor , merely makes things worse . It seems that no unity , including the film and manager possess any cue what the sin is happening at any given bit . rather they chose to get what approximately amounts to the filmic equivalent of a sitcom magazine display . There exist scenes taken straight from India , shadow pee , Shutter , The grudge series , and a smattering of impulse for safe bar . Making matters worse , 7 7 7 female leads all do and read their lines likewise , making them unsufferable to say aside . There is barely zip to get onto with this picture . The history is n't all that easily thought out . The blackout widget is faineant . The mystery factor is Ford - involving and handled with slight state . The characters never deduce anything , all the information is exactly handed out through the track remembering her yesteryear whenever it is commodious for the game . The motion , good of reflections and shots of body at least attempts to sum to the subtext , a thematic connection with the Atlantic and the last spin ( which I wo n't bring ) is decent , but frequently overwrought . still the account feels borrowed and cliché . Worst of all , the inciting activity for the nemesis is n't really interesting and the last device is predictable and crippled . " look , you have that 7 quality who has hours hours of silver prison but appeared to have nothing to do with the plot comes back in the end ? No ! " Audiences are too savvy for this kind of tripe . Anyone who has seen any of the films that this rips off will find very little to even keep them awake with this feature . I used to think Shimizu was the bottom of the barrel for this kind of crap ( remaking his grudge film no less than 5 times ) but even his second rate work like Reincarnation , a film I could n't even bring my self to finish , is miles ahead of this .

straight do n't get me wrong , I love seeing half naked chicks wiggling around . It 's part of the fun of a Moroccan restaurant : ogling the belly dancers . But it does n't make much of a game . My first major problem is the music . I have the feeling that when Ann Rice wrote " The Vampire Lestat " , the Cure was more the style of the music he would have liked ( though I could be wrong ) . I know relating to current " goth " music might have seemed like a good idea , but they did a horrific job incorporating it . Lestat was an actor with presumptively a pretty good singing voice . That they chose Jonathan Davis to be his stage voice is heartbreaking . Second , and someone else said it , mashing two very intricate books into 7 stinky picture is a big idea . " Lestat " could let been a movie in it 's own right , and a damn honest one if done right . I honestly do n't think " Queen of the Damned " lends itself to a movie very well . Though I would love to see a movie that incorporates a creation story , there 's too much , how to word this , " inaction " in the book for it to be a very interesting movie . And the retelling they did soiled it reasonably disadvantageously . Now mind you , it 's been a long time since I ' ve read it , I always thought " Lestat " , " Tale of the Body Thief " and " Memnoch the Devil " were much more action packed and would have made better movies . I know a lot of people ( hey , myself included ) who like a lot of cheesy dogshit crap that thought this perfectly absolutely the worst of the genre to be a major motion picture . I tend to agree with them there . Aaliyah had a nice body though . sub_rate: 0.037142857142857144; NE_rate: 0.07692307692307693
This movie was dogshit . The book is so good of holes ; I ca n't see how the producers agreed to finance it . We are never given an explanation of ANYTHING . The playacting is ugly . The game sucks . This movie was obviously written for those 8 and under . I have to say this : why are the high school classes only 2 minutes long ? Teacher walks in , finds a frog in the desk , or drawing on the chalkboard , and 30 seconds later , the bell rings , class is over . The kids have n't even opened their books . Can we have at least a little continuity?Oh , the dialogue . Milo Jeter is the re - incarnated , aborted fetus , zombie thing . Do we really need the line , " This is Dr. Jeter 's office . Dr. Jeter , Milo 's father . " Thanks for the tip ; I could never put that together myself . It never gets any better . Why does Milo talk the way he does , even in the beginning ? Was Milo ever ` real ' . Or was he never real , just always what he currently is ? And if it was always that way , why the unexplained ` accident ' Milo had?Besides " What is Milo ? " , what are all the unresolved items for ? We see all these contraptions in his father 's medical office , and are never given an explanation of what they are for , or what they have to do with the story . What are the injections for ? What about the aquarium contraption ? They obviously are n't needed . ( See the movie , it 'll make sense ) . And what does this medication do to anyone ? Apparently nothing , since it has no effect on the lead actress . This movie is a very , very tough rip off of all the other slasher movies . It 's a actually tremendous Friday the 13th / Halloween slopped together by a 10-year old writer . It 's not cheesy enough to laugh at , it 's just an incredibly frustrating bore . sub_rate: 0.02368421052631579; NE_rate: 0.0
Gamera vs Viras was made lazily and much of it suffers as a result . Space Aliens try to take over Earth and are stopped by Gamera . So they send another ship that manages to kidnap two young boys . The aliens then take control of Gamera and get him to attack mankind . First of all I must say that I really enjoyed the monster fight at the end between Gamera and Viras . Viras looks like a big squid with a beak . He has no energy weopons and does not shoot any rays out but he can close the apendages on top of his head to make a sharp pointy weopon . SO overall this is not a bad monster for Gamera to fight and is decent . Viras really injures Gamera badly by stabbing his underside of his shell with his pointy head and I am surprised Gamera was able to survive this . Unfortunately Gamera vs Viras decided to use footage from previous Gamera films to fill time for this film . They re show the battles between Gamera and Barugon and Gamera and Gaos when the aliens look at Gameras past battles . However when they show Gamera 's battles with Gaos they show the battle between Gamera and Gaos in the city first , then they show the final battle between the two . After they show re used footage of the final battle between Gamera and Gaos they show the FIRST battle between Gamera and Gaos ! ! ! Talk about showing the battles in non chronological order . THey did not even need to show the first battle they should have just stopped after they showed the final battle between the two . Another issue is that they decide to re show footage of Gamera attacking cities when the aliens order him to attack Tokyo . So they show the scene from " Gamera vs Barugon " where he destroys the Dam . After the show scenes from " Gamera The Invincible " which is a huge issue for me . Mainly due to the fact that " Gamera The Invincible " was in BLACK AND WHITE ! ! ! ! Using stock footage from a black and white film in a COLOR film is actually faineant and that is not a good thing . Also the dubbing is big once again . The two little kids are not that annoying but it would be nice to see a Gamera film that did not involve little kids . So the over use of footage from other Gamera Films is a deterrant to this film . The final fight is awesome so basically I recommend skipping to the final ten minutes and watching this film . The rest is something that has already been seen before . sub_rate: 0.0063025210084033615; NE_rate: 0.0
Unreal ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! . After reading the initial reviews posted by alleged reviewers , I was shocked to feel that almost all of the initial reviews , 38 , all rated this motion a 10 . Upon comparison with other great films , these reviewers felt that the Quick and the Undead is a better motion than , Ford 6th Sense(8.2 ) , Saving Private Ryan(8.4 ) , Lord of the Rings ( 8.7),Godfather(9.5 ) , Gladiator(8.1 ) and David of the Dead ( 7.8 ) to name a few . Hopefully these shills utilize their next discounted lasik procedure , that they hear of , because it is completely obvious that these reviews have been falsified . I was led to think that this motion featured a unique concept in the genre of David film making . Sadly upon watching the Quick and the Undead , It is obvious that these reviews were generated by people who either were involved in the production , or suffer a vested interest in the films marketability / financial success . Nothing cements this in my mind more than hearing that a luck of this motion was shot in Texas , were , coincidentally allot of the early posting praising the motion are from . The David film / Horror B movie culture on a unit is a forgiving group , but this picture is sadly beyond any redemption . The characters are recycled , and the game short . The picture tone was not bad enough to be labeled camcorder , and at least they used a picture tone tv . The acting is ugly , the principal trying unsuccessfully to follow off as a Clint Eastwood wanna be clone . Christ on a Bike ! ! ! ! ! ! still the lead worker 's name is Ford . He was merely tremendous . The only resemblance to Clint Eastwood , is that the trail is using the " wood " from Eastwood 's figure in his style of acting . The Zombie war was above 2001 party quality , but not applied completely to the good undead form members . Allot of zombies were not made up on their men . The game was so hokey that it had me hoping for a ability outage , a blemish on the DVD disk , or that the zombies would turn their attention on the director . Maybe the film has worth to some viewers , but not for my hard earned dollar . Luckily I used my free rental coupon to check out this DVD . Maybe this film will be rescued by Nott entertainment ( aptly named ) releasing a special collectors DVD , which will tie up loose flaws , and deliver the promised goods ? ? ? Some how , I think NOTT ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Lets just hope that their next release , The Flesh Keeper is truly a " keeper " of a film .. and not a 5th generation recycled version of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre .

Perhaps the weakest film in the " Kharis " series , despite the presence of John Carradine ( miscast as an Egyptian high priest ) and George Zucco ( as his predecessor , hilariously afflicted by a bad case of Parkinson 's Disease ) supporting Lon Chaney Jr. as the titular creature - if indeed it was him under the bandages , as his contribution is negligible at best ! It 's a watchable 60 minutes in itself , I guess , but the standards have considerably lowered when compared even to the two previous entries , and the end result is strictly routine and not at totally memorable . Just about the only interesting feature here is the fact that the female lead happens to be the reincarnation of Princess Ananka , mentioned a great deal in earlier films but never actually seen . sub_rate: 0.006896551724137931; NE_rate: 0.0
I love watching Australian movies but this steaming deal of dogshit was exactly apparently unenviable . The DVD cover looked promising but you know what they say , do n't judge a DVD by it 's cover . I also noticed that it won Best Actor for an award but the competition must have been really bad because the acting in this film is wretched . It just seemed that the director thought he had enough talent to direct and act when he should really focus on one part of film - making and get it right before spreading himself too thin . The music was reasonably ordinary . The story really did n't go anywhere . It was just a sequence of fights strung together with short hand and cheesy dialogue . I will say this to all aspiring filmmakers though . Watch this film . It will give you hope that your film will win something at some festival . However , good on them for getting in there and having a go . Hope they learned some lessons and their next venture is a little better . sub_rate: 0.04736842105263158; NE_rate: 0.0
I just recently watched Ed Wood Jr. 's autobiographical motion Glen or Glenda for the first time after having heard so much about it for so many years . Nothing I had read or heard about this film could prepare me for what I saw . This has to be the most outlandish movie ever made . Stampeding buffalo , women in bondage , Prince prancing around and Bela David , rambling exclusively as he can , " Bevare , Bevare .... get the string , get the train ... " , it was wholly mad . The playacting was unspeakable and the dialog was accidentally hilarious , exactly what one would expect from an Ed Wood picture . Having said all that , as ugly as this motion was , I have to give Wood credit ... he was way ahead of his time . You have to remember that when this movie was made transvestites were not even discussed in public , much less the subject for a movie . I have read that Wood was a transvestite in real lifetime , and I ' m sure this movie was based on his own experiences . It lamentable sad check David Bela Lugosi having to say farcical ridiculous lines he had to say for this film , but it was kind of Ed Wood Jr. to at least give Mr. Lugosi an business job at a time David Bela lifetime life when he was penniless and a drug addict and no one else in Hollywood would hire him . If you have never seen this film then you have to see it , especially if you are a fan of Ed Wood Jr. sub_rate: 0.08450704225352113; NE_rate: 0.0
"Nicodemus" is almost a copy of "Red" in the odd behavior sense, but this episode focuses on other people in Clark Kent's unpredictable life. When a poisonous flower finds it's way into Smallville Jonathan Kent is the first to be effected by it. the flower causes people to reverse their behavior and when it effects Jonathan, he becomes short tempered and violent, however Clark manages to stop him from doing anything rash until his father finally passes out. okay. so far, so good. next up is Lana. the Episode was good up to that point, for the flower causes her to attempt seducing Clark. at the last moment, he refuses her but the damage has already been done. this episode causes the wrong impressions and isn't suitable for people under the age of twenty, due to it's adult content. the first part was good, the last part (focusing on the effect the flower has on Pete) was good, but the middle that was all about Lana's alternate personality, was most defiantly not, and that ruined what could have been a brilliant Episode.

This movie had so much potential to be hilarious yet moving but fell way short of either . It had a great narration line , it just was not executed as good as it could have been . The weird " hallucinations " during his sleep scenes made absolutely no sense and definitely was not needed , they made no impact nor did they enhance or lend any understanding of what was to come or happen . Jon Heder 's quality was OK but could have been expanded upon more . He played the stinky part he was given at his best . The character was funny , but again , it fell short of what could have been . Mila 's character was perfect and her performance was spot on . In closing , the composition was ugly and more often than not , made no sense and his hallucinations did not fit with the movie at all . This movie , with better scripting and directing , could have been a contender to National Lampoon 's Vacation as far as funny , bad things happening to a person on a trip across America . Instead , it was just worthy of a second " flush " . If I would have seen this at the theater , I would have demanded my money back and boycotted the film . The only thing that this film did was do an hour and a half of my lifetime . It also managed to make all those involved in the movie look high , simply because the movie was a lowlife . I do not recommend this movie to anyone ! Ever ! sub_rate: 0.03546099290780142; NE_rate: 0.0
I wasn't sure where this was headed until the ending. when it turned out that this was all a liberal conspiracy to hand the world over to European wimps and the United Nations. What a load of right-wing crud! Incidentally, the bit about Canada joining the US didn't really have much to do with the plot at all and the idea was never developed. The only point of it seems to be that it made the main character eligible to run for President(but they could have just made him American and dispensed with that). In any event, this was a load of bull and not worth your time.

This is a great disappointment . The main problem is the playacting . Sylvestre le Touzel is reasonably inadequate as Fanny , and the rest are not much better , everybody is very artificial and unnatural . Also the camerawork is very 1980 's ie cramped and jumpy , compared with the likes of 1995 's P&P , for example . The script is , if anything too faithful to the book , and there are some cringe worthy expressions that should have been cut . In every way this is far deficient to the recent film version , which though it took huge liberties with the book , seemed far more faithful to the spirit of the book and was far more enjoyable . sub_rate: 0.048; NE_rate: 0.0

We have to watch who the honest guys exist . The marriage . And who the tough guys exist , a full humanity who steals elections and his bad boy . The film forces us to understand honest from iniquity . All the characters hate the tough guys so that when watching the picture , this can serve us along on hating the tough guys . This is the worst variety of picture - making - manipulative and childish . The game centers on a copper who is in - between the commodity and the big , and he 's stuck in this wretched picture . It 's ho and superfluous . The story by genius Keach is genuinely tough . And a honest player , David David , overacted to the hilt , playing the guy no unity likes , and who we exist n't supposed to like .

it 's a real big bummer that people easily are able too make movies because of cheap digital video cams nowadays . usually I would appreciate this possibility but if you see movies like this it 's just a big shame . and it 's also big shame if people like h.p . lovecraft get abused by the likes of this . I rented this " movie " cuz of the drop " h.p . lovecraft " on it . and I 'm a big fan of many of his adaptions , mainly those done by brian yuzna & stuart gordon . this movie has nothing to deliver ! a cheap scenery on a beach and in an old wine - cellar . digi - cam effect " red light " over the whole movie . no actors , just some stupid low - grade models who have for sure no idea what they are doing , stiff as wood . and so must be the director . It 's obvious that he tried to create some atmosphere . but as the whole things is so amusing it just does n't work . and no gore - effects , just some blood in a river ( you drink = you become demon ) and dropping here and there . oh yeah , the story : thousands of years ago some " big old " colonised the world and took humans as slaves . then mankind got independent , so the " old ones " tried to destroy them . and now there are some survivors in a post - apocalyptic world . the only possibility to save mankind is to find the NECRONOMICON , that 's where it gets to LOVECRAFT . so those soldiers fight against some undead and demons on their beach and in their wine - cellar . unbelievable - the whole thing ! but as it is dubbed ( german title : " Armee des Jenseits ) and you can find it in most commercial video - stores it seems as if you can make money with stuff like that .

This film was produced and released as a successor to a ghastly - although fairly popular - slapstick Californian beach comedy called Hardbodies , but it has little or no connection with the earlier film and is better assessed completely in its own right . It is certainly better than Hardbodies I , and is more closely related to films such as Venus and Summer Lovers which were also filmed during summer in the Greek Islands . The combination of blissful beaches on blue bays with beautiful bare bosoms makes for seductive viewing , but ( except for travelogues just designed to help plan your next holiday ) even such films require an adequate story line if they are to hold a viewers attention for more than a very few minutes . Venus was underpinned by the legend of the re - incarnation of the goddess , and Summer Lovers had the viability of a " menage a trois " as its theme . In my view both these films were much more successful than Hardbodies II which has a very tenuous story line and depends too much on simplistic semi - slapstick comedy . The use of slapstick quickly becomes wordy , it usually leads to a series of very short self contained cameo sequences that are hard to integrate into an ongoing story line . Mel Brooks achieved this brilliantly with Silent Movie , but few other films have succeeded in the same way , and Hardbodies II unfortunately does not . There is also the problem that the slapstick sequences do not co - habit happily with the idyllic and peaceful scenario in which the film is set . The final airport sequences were no doubt intended to provide a hilarious ending for this film but in my opinion they are an example of the worst type of overplayed slapstick pseudo - comedy . They are also grossly overlong , so I left the cinema with a big taste left in my mouth . This is a film which could have been much more successful with a stronger story line and with most of its slapstick sequences very heavily pruned . As it was released it certainly does not warrant a viewers rating higher than 3 . 	  There is little memorable in the acting , but the cast does its best within the limitations imposed by a meagre story line and poor direction - it is in these latter areas that the failure arises . sub_rate: 0.00477326968973747; NE_rate: 0.0

Overall it was a watchable movie. I didn't pause it or stop it to come back to it--a clear sign of a boring movie--so it passed the first test. Best of all, it got into the story fast, no boring unneeded back story for the characters.It will never go down as a great movie. Nor as a great B movie. I would recommend this movie to slasher/horror fans who don't mind straight to video releases.Unlike some movies of it's ilk, there is no nudity, only moderate language and rather subdued gore. There is violence though. The deaths were rather dry and unimaginative sadly. The computer special effects were actually pretty good. The way the 'creature' wielded his chains in some scenes reminded me of 'Spawn' and the 'Ghost Rider' comic books.A little pet peeve...It's set in Lousinia, but no one seems to talk with any accent. I had to watch the credits to even realize it was filmed in Lousinia.Like most low budget movies, there are small goofs in the filming. Lack of time and money would be the main factors for the goofs. For example in one scene it went from mid afternoon to pitch black in seconds...during a short car ride. The other instance was the stunt double for the 'creature' didn't have on the 'creature' makeup when falling out of the tow truck...it also looks like he's wearing a shirt in the scene.In summary, I didn't hate this movie but I also didn't love it. I probably will never rent it again, but if a buddy owned it, I may watch it again in a few years. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
I had a different experience with this movie - it never got charming , or delightful , or funny for me . one great clue that this was not your typical movie was that the label gave no indication of the Ianguage(s ) spoken in the film . another was the deficiency of choices re subtitles .

I suffered the observation of this picture at Sitges festival 2001 2001 . If there would be a opening of " unfilm " a picture to ward its creation , this should be the 5th in the inclination . María David is n't a manager , she is hardly a silent womanhood that pretends that holding a television with the deal and cry " activity " makes her a professional picture Creator . What a misapprehension ! The picture itself is superfluous and a entire dissipation of effective actors that could be doing something better in another task .

I was watching TV one day with a friend and we caught the last twenty minutes of "Going Bananas." Believe me when I say it was enough to get a good judgment of the film. The first scene that I saw was the monkey, the kid, the fat guy, and the black guy who looked like Dave Chappelle, flying around in a crop duster thousands of feet in the air. While everyone else was solemn about the journey, the monkey seemed to be on some kind of drug binge where he kept shouting something that resembled the English word faster. They then landed on a twenty yard long dock in Africa. After a heart felt goodbye where the monkey cried (Hahahaha), the "villains" of the film appeared. They were tearing complete ass in their vintage Cadillac when the evil monkey took an Air Jordan leap form the dock onto the boat that was sailing away a clean 40 yards away and made them sink their beautiful car into the Pacific Ocean. After seeing this film, I have a new purpose in life; to find the midget who played the monkey and stab him in the eye with a fountain pen. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0

this picture is hence tough . but its thus tough that i was laughing my bottom off . for people that like movies , do not watch this one . for masses who like movies honest and tough , i recommend this one . the news lines shaky , the hand is ugly , the playacting is ugly to mediocre . the soundtrack throughout the movie was platitudinous but i loved it . the cool catchphrases were a plus tho . ha ha . " if it can bleed , it can die " . the fight scenes cracked me up . it seemed to me like they spent more time on those parts than any other cuz the fight scenes for the most part were fairly clean . i well feel like this picture could deliver been good if it were n't for the f / x .... no it would have still been a crapshoot . the eye thing was platitudinous . and how the skirt was eating the guys stomach in the kitchen , they coulda done something where shed be really eating something or at least put more of the fake blood on her face . and the lighthouse explosion disappointed me . i thought they might have gotten real fire instead of stinky computer synthesized stuff . and the ending was thus predictable , which surprised me when they actually did what i though they might perform . so overall . i d say this is a classic equally far as stinky movies go . its in my bottom 5 . sub_rate: 0.10150375939849623; NE_rate: 0.0

But where as David was a outstanding motion that I scarcely did n't require to follow once , David David is a motion I scarcely hate to high perdition . The sole potential turmoil in the motion is the gratuatious incest intimate view towards the goal of the motion .

The animation is great , I 'll concede to that . But Disney perpetuated every stereotype we Alaskans have been trying to overcome for the last two generations . And the names , I mean , come on ...

And the real people these real places were named for are probably struggling out of the Earth seeking vengeance over this old little flick .

I do n't understand the humor in this film . I also found it offensive on how Koreans were depicted in that film , despite how it is actually just a caricature of Koreans in those areas . First , the actors are Japanese , and they make the most rude expressions of Koreans in that film . It disgusts me on how these people are expressed . I felt anger just watching that one scene , and how they were so disadvantageously made out in the film . The humor lasts just for one laugh , and then you do n't understand why it 's even funny . It 's crude humor with the most skanky representation of society there . I found it to be an offensive film overall ... Maybe it was just because I never lived in the " hood " or saw any " hood " movies , but I do n't intend to either . sub_rate: 0.012422360248447204; NE_rate: 0.0
This is an excruciatingly ho , slow - moving movie . We can feel some sympathy for the socially- and sexually - inexperienced and awkward Tomek , but the motivations of Magda are pretty hard to see , and the ending , at least for me , was inscrutable . Maybe it 's about how we all need love , but I 'd get more out of a good Busby Berkeley . I'm told that comments have to be at least ten lines , so I 'll add that in the background are some interesting shots of the relationship between Polish citizens and government employees and institutions . I wonder if it 's meant to portray this before or after the fall of the communist government . Finally , watch for the clever way the men from the gas company investigate whether or not there is a gas leak in Magda 's stove . sub_rate: 0.006493506493506494; NE_rate: 0.0
The Girl in Lovers Lane is one strange little low - budget film . On its surface , the movie tells the story of a tough drifter named Bix ( Brett Halsey ) who spends his time looking out for a young kid named Danny ( Lowell Brown ) and the girl , Carrie ( Joyce Meadows ) , that Bix meets who would like to look out for him . Nothing overly interesting happens ( Bix goes out with Carrie , Bix gets Danny out of trouble , Carrie 's father drinks a lot , etc . ) until about 10 minutes to go in the movie when Carrie is murdered . Her father blames Bix , pulls him out of a jail cell , and just about beats him to death . Now their roles are reversed and Danny has to save Bix . Until I read the reviews on IMDb , I thought that maybe it was just me reading more into Bix and Danny 's relationship than was really there , but I see now that I ' m not alone . It was quite obvious to me early on that Bix and Danny had more of a relationship than you usually see in a movie from 1959 . The homosexual nature of their relationship , while never openly expressed , is still quite obvious . Their living and sleeping arrangements , Bix 's reaction to finding Danny in bed with a prostitute , Bix 's inability to commit to Carrie , and that phone call at the end when Danny tells his parents he 's " brining home a friend are a few examples of moments that lead to the inevitable conclusion that there 's more to their relationship than initially meets the eye . I ' m sure they exist , but I ca n't think of any movies I ' ve seen from the 50s that scream homosexual quite as loudly as this one . As for the movie , I do n't know any other way to put this ho it 's boring . As I wrote earlier , nothing much at all happens for 90 % of the run time . The characters are ho and the actors are n't good enough to give The Girl in Lovers Lane much of a spark . The lone exception is Jack Elam . His crazy Jesse is the one character interesting enough to be worth watching . Elam had creepy down pat ! But I guess the biggest problem I had with the movie was with character motivation and logic . Carrie is killed and Bix is immediately blamed ? What about crazy Jesse who has been stalking Carrie for probably her whole life ? Anyone think to ask Jesse where he was that night ? Her father has seen him bother Carrie at the diner , yet he never considers that the leering Jesse might have something to do with his daughter 's death ? Not a lot of logic there . And what about Jesse 's confession ? Danny grabs Jesse by the lapel and this is all it takes to force a confession out of Jesse ? Real tough guy , huh ? Why would he confess so easily ? And after he confesses , no one thinks to grab him ? It 's awfully nice of Jesse just to stay put and not run off . In any other reality , he would have never spilled his guts and would have run like a rabbit if he had been fingered for the murder . The fact that The Girl in Lovers Lane asks me to accept these ridiculous actions on the part of the characters is something I ' m not willing to do . Overall , I ' m giving The Girl in Lovers Lane a 4/10 . sub_rate: 0.0031007751937984496; NE_rate: 0.0
I intend it 's the 5th prison that I go inside a field and buy away thus frustrated . There were 7 grounds why I went to go " Casablanca Casablanca Casablanca Casablanca " : 5th as a movie fan , and 5th as a great Ford fan . In the death , the picture does n't live any postulation . It 's only a great alive plenty and it proves that the Ford enfranchisement is going from big to worse . In fact , it has been this manner since the end of 5th scenarist David David in 2001 . His faithful partner , illustrator David David took his home , but the following books were distinctly lacking of the tone that was present during the Goscinny 2001 . " Astérix et les Vikings " found based on record book Casablanca Casablanca Casablanca Casablanca Normands " , which was published during David sovereignty reign . The level story is the same : Goudurix , Abraracourcix ' nephew ' arrives to settlement village Ford Ford Ford Obélix become turn him into actual world man , while Ford do come David Gaul society order learn discover care fear is , because it seems care fear gives wings . The similarities end here . What follows in record book is a non hold stop series of laughs , gags uproarious dialogue dialog with event result that Ford Vikings reveal care fear and they David Gaul . picture movie ridiculous silly , unfunny tight fast - paced , corny ... Well only bring name a default and it honest good chances of being applied ... conflict difference between record book and motion movie could be satisfactory acceptable if motion movie honest good . But fresh new only simply crashes it in a Hell pit still Even David Astérix movies such as Casablanca Casablanca Casablanca Gaulois " , well almost transferred the lines one by one without changing exist are easily better life Animation has tone quality former 2001 2001 century movies , but it has its faults and picture film beginner get find the mistakes . The instance example is the misapprehension mistake , 2001 2001 day follows the night after a fraction 5th second , in the successiveness sequence think Imagine . They life animation studios from numerous countries and even still ca pay get picture film qualification making . The changes of the original story are simply unbearable . And they still could be even if there was no original story . Goudurix , in the movie , has a pet pigeon named SMS and who act as his cell phone ( ! ) . Grossebaf , the Viking chief , has a rebellious teen daughter named Abba ( ! ) and she constantly defies her father 's authority . There 's also a stupid Viking wizard , his cartoonish dumb and muscular son , the faithful bride of Grossebaf who is obsessed with decoration ( her name is Vikea ! ) and ... well I ca n't stand that much longer . We 're far from the original gags from the original book . The biggest problem is the difficulty of transferring the images to the big screen , mainly because the greatest laughs in the books come from the verbal jokes and visual gags which do not have the same appeal on a theatre screen . I remember that the greatest moments in the book were Obélix laughing at the invaders ' names ( which all finish in ' af ' ) and Goudurix tries to scare them in ridiculous ways . And if everything was n't enough , somebody in the publicity staff decided to write on the movie poster that there 's an already existing Céline Dion song which would be featured in the final credits . If it was a new song , I could have understood . But using an old song is only another proof that the movie is so badly made that they 're ready to do anything in order to attract film - goers . The only good point for this movie is that it is so stupid and the end is so bad that we just ca n't walk out of the theater without being left cold . In a summer release , it just ca n't hurt ... The only other acceptable point of the movie is how Goudurix becomes courageous . His psychological transformation in the book is too spontaneous and not credible , while it 's better pictured in the movie and the motivation point is more believable . So if you have n't seen the movie yet , do n't waste your money on it . Grab the book instead . Oh René , why did you leave us ? sub_rate: 0.14856429463171036; NE_rate: 0.08403361344537816
I ca n't remember the worst film I have watched . Total waste of actors and audience time . If you prefer sitting by your TV and think when will be this film over , then this is the good film for you . Maybe this film is recorded to make people believe that Moscow has some mystique past . But I must say I have not expect anything else from Rade Serbedzija , but I have expected more from Vincent Gallo . The film lacks a game , quality , development , denouement . full movie is about underground tunnels and how they are mystique . I must be fair there is some camera effect but even that is too inadequate . Over and over are the same pictures . entire dissipation of time . sub_rate: 0.051470588235294115; NE_rate: 0.0
I love camp movies , believe me and the usual technicolorian gore of Gordon Lewis do n't get me at all , but this is just one of his most unintelligent movies , even more than BLOOD FEAST , i ' m not kidding . THE GORE GORE GIRLS is about a mad person who kills a lot of go(re ) - go(re ) girls of a night club . A detective and a reporter tries to find out the big secret . Maybe the performances here slimly slightly better than the usual average acting H.G Lewis films , but that is not saying much . The camera work is frightening dreadful . But at least is kind of watchable with the go go girls acting ... you going guide pass a good time with it , and the killings merely preposterous absurd in a very really very tough way : A girl is killed with a wooden hammer punching in her butt ( ! ) and just do n't let me talk about what it does with the nipples . You going to laugh like anyone with this . But the better of all plenty mess is scenery scene that solely only love of it 's campness : the go - go girl before being attacked by a lot of feminists dancing in a very manner way . Though is important to note that this was one of the first films that got an X rating because of it 's violence .

The most famous thing about this movie is that this was the first time Garbo talked in a motion picture. Aside from that 'milestone' (if you want to call it that) this is a movie that doesn't go beyond creaky melodrama, with Garbo trying her best not to fall asleep.The plot involves Greta Garbo returning to her Father after 15 years abroad. Her father, who is a captain on a barge, is happy to see her, even though she's acting a bit cagey. She soon falls in love with a grizzled seaman, who also notices that something, a barrier if you will, is holding her back.Anyways, the two fellows don't particularly like each other and soon come to blows over Garbo, when she diffuses the situation by revealing her Big Secret which is no surprise to us, if you've read the video box (damn you MGM!!) Garbo is nothing but arms in this movie, she acts and acts flailing her arms about, and gets grating quickly. The two male leads are alright. Probably the best performance comes from the classic silent actress Marie Dressler, who plays the drunken captain's even drunker girlfriend. What a performance! It's too bad the tagline couldn't have read, "Dressler Talks!" sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0

Woodbury rooms with understanding songstress Linda Ware ( as Donna Andrews ) , who advises Woodbury to get in touch with old orphanage friends John Archer ( as Bob Elliott ) and Jack La Rue ( as Mickey Roman ) . But , none of her friends can help when Woodbury is the victim of a scam , which lands her in prison . Upon release , Woodbury decides to give the male mobsters a run for their money   Re - titled " Gangs , Inc. " , this is an apparently weak , cheap mobster melodrama . Still , it 's a lot of fun to watch Woodbury work wonders with inferior material . She plays the innocent growing more sophisticated " Rita " quite convincingly ; and , she tosses in a great bit as a blonde hooker . Woodbury must be added to the list of unfortunately underutilized Hollywood actresses of the past . " Paper Bullets " also features an early Alan Ladd ( as Jimmy Kelly aka Bill Dugan ) . Ms. Ware , who sang the hit " An Apple for the Teacher " with Bing Crosby , sings a couple of fair ' 40s numbers nicely . But , mainly , it 's Woodbury 's show . * * * * Paper Bullets ( 1941 ) Phil Rosen ~ Joan Woodbury , Linda Ware , Alan Ladd sub_rate: 0.003401360544217687; NE_rate: 0.0
Alexandra Ripley wrote a horrible sequel to Margaret Mitchell 's masterpiece book published in the 1930 's . Margaret Mitchell 's heirs sold out their rights and for big bucks allowed Alexandra Ripley to write a piece of junk book even worse than Barbara Cortland romance novels . I was a huge fan of Margaret Mitchells book and the fake sequel by Alexandra Ripley was written just to cash in for money . Although I always admired the acting talent of Joanne Kilmer and Timothy Dalton , this is a really tremendous film . The script is horrible and full of clichés . Ann Margarets cameo as Belle Watling is so tremendous I wanted to slap her . The only worthwhile thing in the movie is Sean Bean who gives a masterful bravura performance as the sexy , feral villain - Lord Fenton . Sean Bean 's performance is along the lines of " The Man You Love to Hate " and portrays an unsafe sex symbol . But Sean Bean is only in the first half of the movie so you then have to be tormented with watching an incredibly long 6 hour movie with an insufferably ho book . Do n't waste your money on this film , unless you are a hard core Sean Bean fan and just watch it for his wonderful performance . sub_rate: 0.01762114537444934; NE_rate: 0.0
gravely , I could n't find anything that constituted a rational human thought in this movie . For some reason , the writer decided to have a bunch of actors in random places grunting , groveling and yelling like Cro - Magnon bipeds . I understand that this was about gymnastics , but seriously , what 's with all the roaring and human bleating ? I also saw at least five actors with overactive terrets syndrome and stage 10 syphilis . Although this movie has actual human acrobatics , I must say it is surprising that you can make a movie like this without having any intelligible form of human speech patterns . This is truly a milestone in the history of film - making because there was no conscious decision to make the characters express anything more than a timely Urrrrr ! or Rfff ! sound .

By far the most racist and ghettoish cartoon for children 7 + . Kids who watch this cartoon will most likely try to dress , talk , and act like the characters portrayed . I am disappointed in Nickelodeon and Nick Jr. for agreeing to air this tremendous program . The Wayan 's Brothers may be good in movies meant for the young adult viewers . They should stick to the movies and not make any more episodes for this cartoon . Usually The young celebs start off working in movies and doing voice - overs for cartoons and then as they grow older , they move up to programs for young adults . A good example is Nick Cannon . He first started out with appearing in All - That , Later on he starred in MIB II , then Drumline , and now his TV show , Nick Cannon Presents : Wild ' N Out , where comedians compete by telling inappropriate jokes . This comment was originally for Thugaboo , but I wanted to show examples of how celebs kids watched on TV not long ago can become those who get involved with non - kid - friendly programs . It is very sad that this happens , but all celebs change and grow up . It is just the opposite with the Wayan 's Brothers new cartoon . It is tough enough we have to deal with all the bad people from the ghettos , with allowing the young generation watch this program , it will just convert the kids with possibilities to the ones who do n't have a chance at a good life .

i was lucky enough to read the book beforehand and i do know a little about Tudor england.the writing directing and editing of this TV movie for the most part was truly amazing . i felt as if i was watching a really bad drama doc about the period rater then a movie.first there were too many cut 's between important parts . And leaving out important events which happened at the time , one is henry 's fall out with Rome over his desire to divorce Katherine of aragon which led to england 's breaking away from Rome and establishing her own church . they barely stuck to the book at all . i 'm all for creative freedom but to a limit , especially when your dealing with a well written book as your starter point . in the book Mary give 's birth to young Catherine first and then she has young Henry is born . Both their father is Henry 's the eight . in the movie they show harry 's first then Catherine . And suggest that Catherine father is William Carey.there are too many bad moment 's in the movie to write them all.i will however say that Jodhi May and Natascha McElhone portrayal as the Boleyn sisters was probably the best part of the movie.if you have n't read the book and know nothing about Hennry 's the 8 court i will recommend to stay away from this movie .

This show has shown it 's true colors now that Democrats are in power . It never did lead the world in IQ as anyone who thought it has intelligence has been programmed to think one way ( which is a chilling thing).Comedy Central moved this & it 's spin off back to an earlier time once the Democrats took power for a reason- because now when the Democrats screw up - which is just as often as Republicans do - Stewart no longer takes pot shots at them . That is why the ratings for both this & the spin are dropping . Basically , most of the humor now is either lame , or lame Sarah Palin jokes - which all the ratings dropping Comedians are now telling . The facts to back this up speak for themselves . The Jay Leno show which has been doing the same kind of humor is on the verge of being canceled . The ratings for Letterman & Conan & the shows that follow them are down . So Emperor Stewart is not alone . Trouble is if any of them start taking real rips at the bungling Democrats in power , they could raise their ratings in a hurry because the best humour is always at the expense of whose in power . The Bush years proved that because the ratings for this show & Colbert , & Letterman & Leno were higher there . O'Bama has done one thing , proved these shows have to be willing to take chances & rip the folks in power if they are to prosper . Right now , the Daily Show & Stewart are sagging but maybe they can get lucky & have Palin elected as the first woman President in 2012 . Then the lame Palin jokes will get ratings grabbers . sub_rate: 0.00964630225080386; NE_rate: 0.0
I was 7 when this motion was released and adored it . The song 's were inspiring and it made me feel honest , watching it various meter 's at the cinema .

Just sat and watched it with my 2 daughters who luck it lot 's misanthropical my cynical older grown up eyes hated it . really 's very poorly directed in many places and considering it was Lionel Jeffries truly I really wanted to enjoy it quality life character then was still rough yet the backgrounds honest quite good .

I like Wes Studi & especially Adam Beach , but whoa is this movie a load of pretentiousness . Ponderously ho . Overly cryptic to the point of obfuscation , not because the plot warrants it but because there is almost no plot . Even less in the way of characterization . This is almost like one of those creaky old Charlie Chan mysteries ( the cheaper Monogram studio versions ) with lots of red herrings & oddball characters ( like the old ex - senator with the checkered past who is now a recluse ) & loads of people getting killed over objets d'art that you would n't look twice at in the mall . Great scenery , though . Pretty hair on the redhead , too , although I never did figure out what she was doing in this at all . Neither could my wife . Sheesh , at least the old B - movies had the decency to be short . sub_rate: 0.006060606060606061; NE_rate: 0.0
A group of teenagers discover a bootleg video game , but once they start playing it , they each start dying just like they do in the video game . As they become addicted to the game , they need to find a way to beat the game 's central villain , The Blood Ford , before she kills them all . The premise does sound a little stupid and familiar but this film could have still been mildly entertaining . However , this " horror " movie is not scary at all . It 's actually more of a comedy than anything else . The film takes itself way too seriously and the movie is not a lot of fun to watch . Sure , there is the occasional laugh but for the most part , the film is very ho . PG-13 horror films can still be good like The Ring or Cry Wolf . The Ring and Stay Alive are n't really the same type of horror film though . Stay Alive is more of a slasher movie and since its rated PG-13 , the death scenes are very tame . It should have been the movie 's main sell and since it had an interesting concept the deaths could have been really good . Unfortunately , the studio wanted a bigger audience and the film had to be altered . The acting is a perfect joke and most of the cast give awful performances . Jon Foster is not a very good leading man . He lacks charisma to really engage the audience or for the audience to care about him . His character is n't unlikable just very bland . David David actually gives an okay performance though a little too bland to truly stick out . David David probably gives the best performance in Stay Alive . That 's an honor on the level of being the best player on the Houston Texans . David Bush is perfectly tremendous as 2001 . Her performance feels hence rushed and so fake . The most vexatious character in the movie is David played by David Simpson . His character is so unlikable you will be rooting for him to die . In fact , most of the characters are reasonably unlikable so that makes it even harder to become interested in the film . It 's just hard to feel sorry for some of these annoying kids and it 's a lot more fun to watch if you want the characters to actually survive . The only real good thing about the movie is the atmosphere . It 's a little old but it still kind of works . The film is also really short so it 's not too much of a pain to sit through . I would n't really blame the cast though because they were working with an inexperience director and writer . The direction is not very good and the screenplay is n't much better . Stay Alive is actually not the worst horror film of 2006 . That honor would go to When a Stranger Calls . Stay Alive is still a missed opportunity though . In the end , this cheesy and lame horror film is better left on the shelf . Rating 4/10 . sub_rate: 0.02877697841726619; NE_rate: 0.0625

Firstly this has nothing to do with the much better 18 weapons of Kung Fu starring Gordon Liu . I mention this as my Kung Fu Theater presents DVD has a totally misleading picture on the cover , the wrong plot on the back and goes on to mention ( no idea why ) The Young Hero starring Hwang Jang Lee . Apart from an introduction to the history of the 18 weapons style told by a monk to some children during the opening and the usual mysterious manual that everyone is after , the weapons never really appear again and the fights are all boxing style . The hero is Lee Shao Hwa who I have never heard of before or any of the other actors . The film mentions another director Wu Yuen Ling as well as the one IMDb lists . The other actors are Wang Fu Quen , Wang Wing San , Chen Fei Fei , Wang Ki San , Suen King Kai and Hwa Yue Suen who seem to have sunk without trace after this film . The fights are fair and frequent but not great and the ' star ' does n't have much charisma . The tress at the death is merely unintelligent and the film seems to end abruptly as though they got bored with it . The scenery and the training sequences in the river are a little different from usual . Unfortunately the pretty sister gets drowned not the very vexatious ( though acrobatic ) young boy . sub_rate: 0.023255813953488372; NE_rate: 0.0
This feels very artificial and patronizing to a great extent . The whole plot is extremely forced - especially the " gallant " effort to save the college from ruin , and the moralistic overtone ( especially by the leading lady ) grates a bit . But there are one or two comic moments that do help relieve the boredom , and the dancing is quite fun ( especially for alleged amateurs - ha , ha!)The shop proprietor and the young guy doing spectacular tap dancing were particular highlights . And I liked Peter Hayes impressions of Charles Laughton and Ronald Coleman as well . sub_rate: 0.009523809523809525; NE_rate: 0.0
The only reason I gave this movie a 2 and not a 1 was because for some reason I felt compelled to finish it out ! Basically , I wanted to see if there were going to be any aliens , any UFO 's , anything at all suggested by the title of the movie , the cover of the movie and the beginning of the movie ! I was very disappointed to see religion being thrown into the mix the way that it was . This could have been used to the movie 's advantage , but I felt , instead , that the movie was trying to send subliminal messages to me ! Finally , how big was this cast 's wardrobe ! ? I became so distracted by the number of different , and extremely brilliant , shirts each character had on in every new scene that I began to wonder if this movie was n't genuinely supposed to be classified under " inadequate comedy".toe thumbs down ! sub_rate: 0.017543859649122806; NE_rate: 0.0
When something can be anything you want it to be or mean , it 's bound to register with someone as being rather special . But just as the shape of a cloud in the sky may appear to one of us or remind us of a battleship , and to another of his aunt 's rear , and yet to another absolutely nothing other than a cloud , this does not make this cloud meaningful except for the viewers ' interpretation . Anyone who might find throwing a stuffed giraffe out of a window brilliant , or worthwhile for that matter , without relating it in some context , is possibly merely trying to impress us with his or her intellectuality . Submitting to this movie as the dreams of a madman does quite nicely , especially since there is no standard or expectation for what said dreams would be like , and even if we were mad ourselves , this would hardly give us sane reference points for comparison . A love affair with this movie entails the same risk as seriously interpreting Nostradamus . Whatever real meaning was being conveyed at the time might be buried in the private jokes , musings , or provincial minutiae of its day , and to a select few radical intellectuals at that ! I did spot a bit of an agenda even with my limited capacity though . The movie is definitely anti - Fascist and to some extent anti - Italian . I noted that although the years 1929 - 30 were years of great public works and urban renewal in Italy , any indication of this seemed avoided . Furthermore , ( avant - guarde academic spinners take note of this for your next class ) the very short cropped haired man with the mustache in the party segment near the end is a caricature of Victor Emmanuel III and his tall female companion none other than Queen Helen , formerly Princess of Montenegro . Without an understanding of potential historical relevance , even the apparent irrelevance is beyond the competence of academic or other intellectual poseurs who would bask in irrelevance to impress us . I gladly add my own paint buckets to the defacement of this cinematic gag . But in an adaptation of the famous mot by the little boy ; The movie really has no face ( to deface ) . Paint would help it burn though . sub_rate: 0.0024154589371980675; NE_rate: 0.0
I ' ve watched this film a few times and I never really liked it . I ' m not a fan so termed " nu horror " , so I ca n't be dismissed on that account . I found it a little sleazy , I think the thing that irks me about Hammers is the sexploitation aspect , not sex mind you , but Sexploitation . I ' m surprised at how many people have rated this film so highly , deliver I 'll have another look at it . But for me , it was n't creepy , it had no atmosphere , just a bit of " omigod , look at those bad / stupid London prostitute women and that little innocent Anna about to get raped by yet another nasty man , ooherh ! " I suppose ultimately for me , the film had no depth whatsoever , just a bunch of nasty priggish men and women only there for the titillation value . This no doubt was to some degree what Victorian England was like , but the sets are even dampen clunky and dull impart a sense of Victorian menace . Roger Corman 's horrors on the other hand , now that 's style , atmosphere and elegant horror . For me hardly this was monotonous exploitative , flat footed wish . sub_rate: 0.022123893805309734; NE_rate: 0.0
Synopsis : the sequel to the acclaimed Silence Of The Lambs , Hannibal is a great budget production that totally fails to deliver ; not only is it not as clever as its predecessor , it is not even a splatter or suspense or horror movie , hardly a altogether irksome time waster . Do not be fooled by the media hype , and particularly the stories about people throwing up in cinema and being mentally scarred for the rest of their lifes because of the brain - eating scene : in the movie it exactly comes across as laughably defective SFX . Why so many people in this forum are claiming that H is " not all bad " and " worth watching on the big screen " , etc . , is beyond me ; and it is not " thusly defective it 's good " either , it is merely apparently irksome . I normally respect other people 's opinion , but in this showcase I have to say that they clearly can not tell * * * * from Shine - Ola . Maybe they have fallen prey to the media hype , maybe they have never seen a Ridley Scott movie before and were impressed by his excessive use of back lighting , smoke and the ubiquitous AC fans . H is totally free of suspense ; instead we get endless scenes of Lecter swanning through an English - speaking Firenze , a totally unconvincing and uninvolving plot with more holes than a fishing net ( after seeing H , I actually lay awake half of the night trying to find all the holes in the plot , and when I wrote them down I quickly filled 6 pages in small type before forcing myself to stop ) . Rather than wasting your time and money on seeing it on the big screen , I would advise you to wait until it comes on TV in a couple of years ; and then to go to bed early.1 / 10.Below are a couple of extra bones I have to pick with Hannibal:- H _ is _ the sequel to SOTL , despite what some people in this forum are claiming . And even though SOTL was a very tough act to follow , there are sequels which _ are _ en par with their predecessors ( SOTL itself was the sequel to Michael Mann 's " Manhunter " , based on Thomas Harris ' " Red Dragon " , and even though the first episode was a very enjoyable film , SOTL was even better ; another example would be the Alien series initiated by H 's director Ridley Scott -- so much for the theory of diminishing sequels ) . In any case , being a sequel is no excuse for a film being utter crap.- This movie has a renowned director , it is based on a novel by the same author as SOTL , the cast is strictly A - list , great cinematography , big budget , first - rate script writers , yadda , yadda , yadda , and the end result is simply a fart in the church . So what went wrong ? I think a lot of the blame has to go to the film 's producer , Dino DeLaurentiis . Here is my interpretation : DDL produced " Manhunter " , which , despite of all its qualities , was a commercial flop . Disappointed , he gave the rights for the Hannibal Lecter character to Orion -- for free , allowing Jonathan Demme to make SOTL , and the rest is cinema history . DDL then had to wait for ten more years ( he is now 81 ) until Thomas Harris finally came up with the sequel novel . I think at this point DDL had lost all interest in making a good movie and was desperate to finally get his slice of the the cake before he pops his cork.- Another aspect that I find thoroughly annoying about this flick is that it is being given so much undeserved hype in the media ; I mean , it is boring , yet one of the highest - grossing productions ever , so there is no need to give it free publicity . And while most reviewers harp on about how Dantesque the scenes in Firenze are and why Jodie Foster did not participate , the simple fact that this movie is an utter , utter , UTTER flop goes unmentioned . But there is more : not only is Hannibal being hyped through the roof , it is also being used as a media agenda setter for a plethora of " documentaries " ( usually the left - overs from similar productions in the wake of SOTL ) about serial killers , cannibalism and profiling . However , not only does H not even pretend to be realistic ; Lecter has also ceased to be a serial killer ( he now only kills out of necessity , or to help Clarice Starling ) , profiling is not even mentioned ( because we already know HL , so there is no need to create a profile ) and there is also no cannibalism : Lecter feeds the drugged - up Paul Krendler his own brain , so that makes it ( erm ) unaware vivo - auto - cannibalism . Try making a documentary out of that.- Much has been said about the acting : mainly whether Julianne Moore can replace Jodie Foster , and Anthony Hopkins ( who plays the lead Hannibal Lecter ) is usually given a lot of praise . I think all of these discussions are moot . There are several of my favourite actors in this movie ( namely Liotta , Oldman and Moore ) but the script simply does not give them anything to work with . Same for Hopkins : there is no development in his character , and he is not being challenged in any way . And by the way , he plays nearly identical characters in all of his movies , only that in H he has to do the odd bit of murder and is getting paid the tidy sum of $ 11 Million to do it . sub_rate: 0.012206572769953052; NE_rate: 0.0

I 'd ease this film a 7 . This film is free of common cinematic essence and concentrates way too very upon the current " skin trend " in Bollywood movies . I 'd definitely not recommend teenagers to watch this motion . What truly makes me feel dejected is how could such an impressive banner like Yash Chopra Films ever succumb to such an tremendous product ? They have perhaps forgotten to keep in view that there is a larger audience than " adult " hearing too , which when exposed to these sort of perfect movies , may wreck their growing mind set and give to things free of sense and recognition . On the whole , films must not just be entertaining , but also must comprise of some sense equally well . Certainly , this picture is an vast disappointment to David David fans , especially me myself . I exist actually disappointed over the game , playacting and everything else . Why ca n't people put in some substance that can be cherished after confronted with in the films , at least for once throughout the picture ? The spot is clean .

Though not a complete dissipation of time , ' Eighteen ' really was n't all sweet as it pretended to be . Nor are the ages of the actors they 're portraying  18 , my butt . McKellen could have actually shown up in the film telling us he was 30 and ask us to believe it . Even Michael J. Fox was more believable as a teen in ' Back to the Future ' Parts II and III ( okay , maybe not ; they 're probably equal believability . ) If you can get past the obvious age flaw , you 'll have either the complete void of acting or simply overacting ( Paul Anthony 's so called anguish , Clarence Sponagle 's Lifetime moments , and even though I do favor Brendan Fletcher , it 's best to just watch him , and more , in ' Freddy Vs . Jason , ' ) incomprehensible scenes ( a faster than Britney Spears marriage , incest to prove a point and a man who needs help to urinate , but still has one hand free  I 'm guessing this was the writer 's fantasy , ) an entire movie of despicable characters ( Anthony might be playing someone that 's 18 , but acts like he 's 12 and some odd " john " thrown in so Anthony 's character Pip can save the day  was there really a sex scene in front of a baby ? ) and practically every character questioning their own sexuality by strange actions / scenes . On the positive side , I did enjoy Ian McKellen 's voice - over , seeing a ( rarely well portrayed ) straight / gay friendship , puppy love ( from someone who collects stuffed puppies , that is , ) good score , some decent dialogue ( love the separation of gays and pedophilia  wish more people would realize that ) and acting from the female leads ( as well as Cumming . ) I ca n't really recommend it as it 's really trying to be too many things  gay tolerance , gay hustling , homelessness , WWII epic , priesthood , first love , flawed judges , etc , etc , etc  on a shoestring budget . sub_rate: 0.002564102564102564; NE_rate: 0.0
Chip Foose is an absolute genius and the end result of the projects are truly amazing. The co-hosts do a good job. I particularly enjoy watching the "project" come together. The end results are much better than when they came off the assembly line what with the mechanical and cosmetic advances of today. However, I do get annoyed somewhat at the fact the "projects" seem to be the property of the already rich and/or famous. It's too bad the ones getting overhauled can afford the undertaking. Let's see now, Vince Neill of Motley Crew gets a car make over for his buddy. Hello! If he (Neill) were a true friend he would have paid to have his friend's car restored. What a joke! Another episode shows a middle aged seemingly well-to-do gal getting her '56 caddy named Betsy done. The husband of 30+ years was behind it all. The couple looked like money was not in short supply.

i ca n't believe how dumb this movie truly is . the storyline ( written by keira knightley 's mother ) is what ruins the movie to the extreme . it is straight out ho , absurd , and makes absolutely no sense whatsoever ... this movie lagged so high for most of it , especially at the beginning . the story just kept going on and on about their everyday flirts with each other , often times seeming like a threesome . in this movie , you have an annoying deadbeat couple ( the poet and his wife ) who are complete total drunks from the start . the wife sleeps around with other men to make ends meet , while the poet is a pervert who thrives on cheap boos and women . the wife , who waaayyyyyy too quickly becomes friends with his former childhood lover ( played by keira ) suddenly gets jealous , knowing full well that the two were lovers since they were kids . something does n't seem right here .... i mean , come on ... get with the program lady ! what 'd you expect.bottom line is : former lovers meet again with new wife embracing it , then gets jealous , then former woman lover gets married and her husband gets jealous , bombards the crazy drunk couple 's home , crazy husband calls police , and they end up going to court for the man 's attempted murder charges . that 's it summed up in a nutshell ... this movie had it 's moments such as the quality and good acting by cillian murphy , but other than that , i can not believe i watched it ... i complained about it during the movie and some family members watching it with me fell asleep . i decided to give it a chance and i should have stuck to my first instincts . sub_rate: 0.006153846153846154; NE_rate: 0.0
Here 's why this movie fell very short of its potential(I do n't read much , so I do n't care WHAT the novel was like ) . 1 . I think Brendan Frasier copied his Encino man from Lambert 's Tarzan . It was stiff , and while his Tarzan call was a little more realistic , he had no humanity . 2 . They screwed with the story . Maybe that 's how the book goes , but for as long as I can remember the first utterances of Tarzan were " Me tarzan , you Jane " . Jane is the first human tarzan encounters . I did like the natives a bit more than the shoepolished midget pigmys in Weismuller 's version , but those bows and arrows were a bit cheesy . 3 . Tarzan is primarily a love story . I ' m good , but the love interest enters over an hour into the picture . That qualifies her for a supporting role at best . Supporting roles and leads do n't fall for each other , not concealment prison time good sorry . Not only was Andie McDowell 's vioce over pathetic(most likely because her strong southern accent could n't be masked ) the chemistry scale between Tarzan and Jane was a whopping 0 . I never believed they loved each other , which made the Belgian dudes closing voice over , quite frankly whacky silly . When Tarzan sees Jane for the first time in the jungle , he feels an urge , if you will , a feeling he 's never felt before . Jane brings out the humanity in him , and he brings out the untamed side of her . Its this chemistry that compells the story of Tarzan . Not that Lord Greystoke 's dying wish is to keep his land whole and that johnny boy is going to do it for him . Even a good face lift could n't help picture movie . It needs intimate internal reconstruction . Oh , and could we possibly shoot more in the jungle , or at least use camera angles that do n't show off the sound stage like qualities of the place . Final judgement , 4 out of 10 . Sorry Tin - man , and by the way , if you want to see real acting , drop Lambert and check out Leonardo Dicaprio . sub_rate: 0.017114914425427872; NE_rate: 0.0

Some people like to tell you that Deep Space 9 is the best of all the Star Trek shows , because it stresses character development and continuity , and features a more complex background and ongoing plots . In some ways this makes it more satisfying , but in many ways the show fails entirely . The series starts out as a soap opera on a space station , with two entire seasons of generic science fiction stories balanced with banal subplots about the characters . The characters are a good bunch , and most of the actors are decent , but I think the writers tried too hard to make them " normal " . By " normal " they actually mean " ordinary and tedious" . At the end of Season Two we are introduced to the Dominion , who hang around menacingly for a while before finally going to war with the good guys in Season Five . This is the main " story arc " of the show , but it only takes up a fraction of the entire series . We still get lame stand - alone episodes , heroes still get stranded on weird planets for forty - five minutes , and there 's an amazing lot of low - brow comedy featuring the greedy , goofy Ferengi . A lot of episodes are merely dull , and some are unwatchable . The Dominion , DS9 's main villains , are bent on galactic domination for the convenient reason that , well , they just do n't like anyone . The entire war is presented with a naive lack of moral complexity and imagination . Impressively pyrotechnic space battles appear with great frequency from Season Three onwards , but these are carried out in ludicrously simplistic ways , such as two huge fleets of super - advanced starships flying right at each other and blasting away . The writers of DS9 ( including the talented Ronald D. Moore , later of " Battlestar Galactica " fame ) spiced up their monotonous show by starting a war , but at heart it is still a pedantic soap . DS9 remains a very frustrating experience . The continuous story is too flat and obvious to be really gripping , and the characters never truly develop in interesting ways . " Babylon 5 " and " Battlestar Galactica " both fulfilled the promise made by DS9 , and did everything much better . For Star Trek , stick with the original and the Next Generation . sub_rate: 0.002331002331002331; NE_rate: 0.0
Lou Gossett , Jr. is an excellent and captivating actor , but to have him take the role of a " president " and then have him act like he 's James Bond , running around carrying a Gun and entering a warehouse to uncover a plot to kill Christians , and then being able to Escape the supposedly High Security Facility to live another day , does Not do him Justice - this movie has so many Unresolved IssuesI will attempt to list just a few : 1 - what was the purpose of " stockpiling " a Vaccine if no one is Vaccinated ? - for example , the preacher could have been Vaccinated if the " tribulation force " already had Vaccine on hand - later , buck Williams ' wife goes to be with the sick preacher and she herself becomes sick ; so , was the Virus , therefore , Contagious ? - IF it was Contagious , then why did Ray and his wife go into the church without Proper Protection ? - why did n't they become Sick too ? - and when Chloe drank the wine and was " cured " , how did she suddenly know the wine was the " antidote " ? - was it California wine , ordinary Red Table Wine ? - could Red Grape Juice been adequate - and , if the preacher had received " communion " at least every time he preached , maybe he would have had anti - dote flowing through his body already ? - buck and Chloe got a " heavy " box of vaccine that was never used - what mysterious message should we see in that ? 2 - the presentation of " evil " forces who are working with the Anti - Christ Nicolai to destroy the world , as being Russian , Chinese , etc . , is really a Relic of the 1950 's and the early James Bond era , and shows an Ignorance of Modern Society and of Humanity - are we to believe that Russians and Chinese are perpetually trying to destroy this Planet ? - and for what Purpose , mere Destruction ? - this was such a Narrow - Minded view of this world and was so David as to be Laughable3 - the main purpose of this movie was the scene near the very end where Kirk Cameron and Lou Gossett , Jr. are proselytizing the non - believers in the audience ( by showing Kirk proselytizing Lou ) - it was a movie with no meaningful storyline , too many disconnects with reality , and a completely inappropriate plot for a great actorI , therefore , rank this as a 1 , since Zero is not available sub_rate: 0.0021321961620469083; NE_rate: 0.0
I thought this picture was going to be good . It perfectly was n't , despite the Oscar - winning lead actors . I may have laughed once , and I never heard anybody else in the theater laughing . Renee Zellweger 's pancake make - up was very unbecoming . Everybody seems to be trying so hard in this picture , running around in impersonation of slapstick but not pulling it off . I think perhaps the movie must ' ve sounded good in development , but something got lost in translation . Were the roaring 20 's really like this ? I think not . Everything seems a tad artificial . Randy Newman grievance score was vexatious . The film is in sepia tones , just like every other movie that takes place in 2001 20 's or 30 's . There 's just not that much originality here . sub_rate: 0.046357615894039736; NE_rate: 0.14285714285714285

This was a movie that could have been great if there were not so many unnecessary historical inaccuracies and if the actors had been chosen or made up to look a little more like the real persons (not very difficult). Sissi did not go to Mayerling to see her dead son, she also did not die in the street; they carried her on to the boat and then back to the hotel, which was much more dramatic. I am not sure about the wedding night, but I find it exaggerated that a lady-in-waiting would undress the empress and leave her completely naked (and that in the 1850's) or that the emperor would announce very proudly "yes I finally laid her" to the assembled court. As far as I know this was done right away on the first night and nobody rewarded her as if she were a streetwalker. The saving grace of the movie is really Stephane Audran, excellent actress and true to character. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
Director Michael Ritchie and actor Robert Redford 's second documentary - style drama , ' The Candidate ' , is a political satire that still seems refreshing and pertinent today . So it 's a pity that ' Downhill Racer ' , made a short time before , seems so dated by contrast . The music is wretched , and the perhaps innovative ski - ing sequences are now standard in televisual coverage of the sport . The world of ski - ing seems strangely amateurish ( probably accurately , given the time the movie was made , but it 's hard to relate to today 's professional world ) , and the theme of Americans in Europe likewise seems hundrum in an age of ever easier travel . Perhaps the biggest problem is the flat game , centred on the arrogant but enigmatic hero ; unfortunately , it 's a dark performance from Redford , offering us little insight into his cares or motivations . And a character - driven film without much of a character is never a good bet . I expected much , but sadly this is a ho movie . sub_rate: 0.02564102564102564; NE_rate: 0.0
Tedium as only the French can do it. I checked my watch for the first time 7 minutes in, and with 143 minutes left, I also considered walking out. I won't even try to discuss the incoherence of the "plot" or the inability of the characters to be personable because at about 1 hour in, I realized none of this mattered. It was not merely self-indulgent or pretentious, it was a vacuum. A soul-sucking vacuum. This film has no saving grace, no enjoyable character, nothing funny, and nothing sad. It isn't smart enough to be drama and there's no moment that's in the slightest bit farcical. The most intriguing thing about this movie is how it has managed to get mostly glowing and positive reviews. I was tricked by those reviews, but you don't have to be, gentle reader. All I want for Christmas is my three hours back. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0

***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS***I saw this movie last night at a screening. I started out already liking Tim Robbins and loving sci-fi. The first third of the movie was very cool. The score was good, the cinematography was interesting, the film maker's vision of the future was realistic yet starkly interesting nonetheless. I remember thinking to myself: "this is the most intelligently done sci-fi movie I've seen in a while". Then they just couldn't keep it together.Although from the outset, there were a number of more "rough around the edges" issues with this film (namely the editing, and later some of the writing/plot development), these issues were forgivable. They became unforgivable once the movie sort of lost all momentum around the half way mark, and then the film just got tedious when you realized that it wasn't going to go anywhere at all. Robbins could not breathe life into his character, but did the best he could. His female counterpart (her name escapes me now) was good in her role.The main reason for the meandering of the movie seemed to be that the film makers could not decide whether or not to do a sci-fi movie or a futuristic love story. They ended up with neither.Good:Some of the cinematography: grainy, it felt like "21 days later" some times.Very fitting for a futuristic movie like this.I dug some of the location shots.The music was cool.The film makers vision of the future was realistic but still cool and interesting.I liked the interactions with the other minor characters in the movie.Some of the writing was interesting (early on). The girl who played Maria Gonzales (name?? can't recall), she was good.***SPOILERS BELOW***A few questions/comments:I felt that a lot of the futuristic things in this movie were convenient to fix a patchwork story. Namely VIRUSES. Obviously the virus they gave her at the end of the film that made her physically 'afraid' of him was just there so that they could stick in another sex scene and then she could uncontrollably report him for Code 46. Then they take him away and erase his memory and the movie ends. Classic 'dream sequence' cop-out ending if you ask me. ties up all the loose ends very neatly if you just make it all a dream right?Was Robbin's character naturally good as intuition or was it the virus?Why didn't they explore the myriad of issues surrounding the girl being a clone of his mom? That could have made some interesting story.At first I like the salutations from across the globe in everyone's speech. But it became intrusive especially since their accents were not convincing. I get it, the future will undoubtedly be racially and culturally more androgynous, but it started feeling like an AT&T Global Networking commercial by the end of it.If they were 'outside' how could they have gotten busted for Code 46?'Cover' was never well defined. Sometimes it seemed as trivial as a Visa, and other times it was as vital as life or death. Again, loose definitions allow them to use it for gluing disparate parts of the plot together.Okay, I'm starting to get to negative about it, so I'll stop. There were some cool scenes, and interesting things about this movie, but that only gives it a 4/10 sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
You ca n't really find the movie maker for glorifying Che because the industry is all about money . Most of the stories you hear about this " freedom fighter " are absolute tripe fabricated by the communist Cuban government after Che 's death . Che was a murdering scumbag from day one . Here 's a list of the great things Che did for Cuba 1 ) Executed thousands of innocent Cuban Men , Women , AND CHILDREN to satisfy his lust for power.2 ) Destroyed Cuba 's economy and good standing with the rest of the world . The Cuban peso used to be equal with the American dollar . Now it 's essentially worthless.3 ) Continually failed at all things that involved diplomacy , economy , and the military . He never made it past his first year in Medical School , and he was only in one real battle , in which he surrendered with a fully loaded gun.4 ) He took over the largest estate in Cuba to set up for himself . He had a Yacht , a 60 " custom made TV from America , a swimming pool , and a view of the Ocean . So much for shunning the materialist life style . Cuba today is an absolutely destitute country , and you have no one but Che and the Castro brothers to thank for it . If you go to Cuba today you will not be allowed out of the tourist areas . If you did manage to get out of what you 're meant to see , you would find slums , beggars , and prostitutes . If you think any of what I ' m saying is untrue then go do some studying . Compare Cuban exports from 1950/60 to those of today ; talk with people who survived or who had parents in the so called Cuban " revolution " of the 1960 's ; read all of the reports of murdered innocents ; read the reports from people who served under Che and Castro and fled because of what an evil , skanky human being he was . And please , please , always remember to read or watch EVERYTHING objectively . Stop taking everything at face value and THINK ABOUT IT . sub_rate: 0.007772020725388601; NE_rate: 0.0
In the wake of the matrix this travesty of a film with easy connections to VR has been reissued with the tag - line " The Matrix just got Deadler ! " , in a box with a very Matrix inspired cover ( still called " Expect to Die " though ) . Due to the choice of font however the tag - line looks to all the world like it says " Beablier " . Anyway . To complete the transformation to Matrix wannabe they have mocked up a VR fight scene with a Morpheus - a - like on the back of the box . It may be important to know that this quality DOES NOT FEATURE IN THE FILM.Overall this film is a travesty on every spirit . Jalal Mehri is an amazing actor and does not impress with his martial arts . However his partner Stone is played by Evan Lurie , who in this film is simply the worst actor I have ever seen . Clearly he was chosen to make Jalal look good in comparison . Worst film I have seen for a long long time . sub_rate: 0.02072538860103627; NE_rate: 0.0
When 7 of my friends recommended this to me , raving about how comfortably it was filmed , the underlying themes and the oecumenical wideness of the motion , I plainly expected an astonishing , at least entertaining picture . hours hours hours I spent watching this turned out to be a immense dissatisfactory dissipation of my prison . I understand that this picture is meant to be surrealistic , but still in surrealistic movies , there is something which anchors it down , still if it is alone in the slightest . This picture , on the former deal , felt strained and false . A fortune of the shots were unneeded and watching it made me remember the music was trying to hard to be esthetic . The playacting was inadequate , and the relationships between characters were not closely developed enough . perhaps that 's exactly me missing something that others could learn but I had n't still realised there was any variety of magnet between David David and Ford before they started getting at it like rabbits arbitrarily 7 room through the picture . so once , possibly this picture was merely defective . I exist not against vehemence in movies , but in this unity , well all of it was merely unneeded . Throughout all the conflict scenes I felt myself cringing at how sorely cliché it all was . And the game ? The news funny comes to head . I would be amused if I had n't wasted hours hours of my animation following this badly thought out and farcical game . Despite all the picture 's flaws , by the goal of it , I was expecting something interesting to resolve it . I wo n't talk the finish , because I would n't require to " plunder " the picture for those who possess n't seen it . scarcely that the metaphor " Be it a tilt or a texture of backbone , in body they sink as the same . " can not be used as an account for everything . This full picture was made for cushion note and cushion note exclusively . I exactly hope earlier or recent masses will contain being thusly ostentatious and tell a big motion for what it is . I ' ve seen former neat Australian Korean films and it depresses me that people have hailed Oldboy as the best . sub_rate: 0.25980392156862747; NE_rate: 0.05660377358490566
I picked this DVD up for 7 at Carl television in society to become decent points to start a better motion for complimentary . I never really was planning on watching this but it started poking at my wonder and i eventually decided to start in it the DVD histrion . The effects in this picture exist ugly and tatty . Some of the dialogue in this picture sounds like it was written by a swear felicitous 2001 2001 2001 boy . The playacting is genuinely cheap in some parts , and the " activity " scenes exist altogether comical . You 'll break out laughing at some parts which was a convinced for me because it kept me gently entertained . The game is some girlfriend has a nemesis on her which causes her to be snakes so some priest has to suffer her to India India , there exist as 7 girls trying to smuggle drugs there and a few former masses that exist insignificant to the game , not that there actually is a game at totally . Do n't expect anything from picture movie and do take listen to book cover , exist are 7 100 passengers 7 3,000 vipers , exist 7 10 passengers 7 20 random snakes . As for the DVD , there is a trailer which nearly equally funny laughable as picture film , pratfall spool reel which exactly 7 scene all over and over 7 histrion actor trying tell power train , and the deleted exist actually superfluous pointless , if they were honest good enough ride stay in picture movie they must somewhat big bad . There likewise also actually big qualification making of featurette which does truly prove show much wholly all except that masses people involved with picture movie were kind of idiots .

Lance Henriksen has a knack for being the top name in a B - movie , even in this showcase starring along side Charles Napier , Master Control Program , and Joe Don Baker . As always he does a great job of being the bad guy , but the plot is only high ( do n't even get me started about the ending ) . And the redaction is thus ugly it might actually be a thing of beauty . Is it just me , or does it seem that Joe Don Baker was spliced into the movie at the last minute ? Also , anytime glass is broken in this movie , the editing is so anti - phenomenal . Lastly , after watching this , I figure David Warner is dying for Tron 2.0 to finally get the green light . Unfortunately for Felony , this will be the third movie I give the rating of 1/10 , joining Iron Eagle IV and No Mercy . sub_rate: 0.03550295857988166; NE_rate: 0.0
I must admit , I was against this movie from the outset but I tried my hardest to be impartial , I really did , but the very idea of remaking a sophisticated , witty , entertaining , quirky British classic full of character has to be dubious from the outset . People in my house were watching this so I swallowed my pride and told myself to be professional about films ( I have studied them at Uni after all).As expected for an American film of this sort , the movie began with a chase which was n't bad . Indeed , many of the action sequences are credible and this alone lifts the mark . Yet the characterisation was unfathomable , the set - pieces could very easily have been spliced from any American schlock blockbuster you might have had the misfortune to watch and it lacked all character . Seeming to take a skewed angle on the original film with a failed initial robbery , the US version does the predictable thing and introduces an emotional factor with the death of Donald Sutherland 's character . This allows our US cousins plenty of opportunity for sycophantic , dewy - eyed vengeance - seeking against the ' evil - doers ' which it milks to predictable excesses . This is never more so evident as in the scenes featuring Charlize Theron ( oh pretty ! oh so pretty ! Look at her pretty , wounded Bambi eyes , everyone ! ) which were thoroughly nauseating . Her entrance scene , particularly , was like something out of Resident Evil or Tomb Raider which were both a ) more entertaining and b ) had better beginnings because they could n't mess up a game like they could with British cinema which was already chock - full of spark , people you genuinely feel something for and moments of inspiration . But I digress , the whole inclusion of a pretty girl for the sake of it just seems like the most ham - fisted manoeuvre I 've seen in some time and exposes cynical Hollywood blockbuster - lust for what it is . If you like any of these actors , by the way , and you agree with any of the above comments , DO NOT GO TO SEE THIS FILM ! If I had the opportunity of watching ' Fight Club ' or ' American History X ' after seeing Ed Norton in this , I would have declined . Likewise Jason Statham with ' Lock Stock ' ( and I suppose ' The Transporter ' is okay if you like that sort of thing).Sadly , all the set - pieces are designed in the most transparent possible way to get you thinking , ' Wow ! He 's smart ! ' , ' Coo ! He 's cool ! ' , ' Hey ! What a tough guy ! ' . Then there 's the ' funny PC guy ' who has ' comic relief ' splattered across his forehead but whose humour content can be anticipated two minutes in advance . To be honest , if you 've seen one or two films like it , you might easily confuse the two as clones from the Jerry Bruckheimer stable . Not that Jerry is irredeemably awful , by the way , but he just uses the clichés to excess as everyone knows ( or should).This is where I have to come clean . I did n't manage to make it to the end , so I could n't even say whether the brilliant ending in the Michael Caine version made it but , I 'm sorry , it 's just one of those extremely rare films that , if I 'd seen it at a cinema , I would have walked out and staged a small protest outside . It 's not just that it is another identical by - the - numbers Ocean 's 14 or something ( Ocean 's Eleven was fine but do n't bother with the rest ! ) with all the glitz , glamour , fake sass and pantomime heroics of such a film but I could n't recognise anything from the original at all . So , if you are expecting ' THE Italian JOB ' and not ' OCEAN 'S 14 ' albeit badly written with a less established cast and characters , some disingenuous elements and cardboard cut - out script - writing then DO NOT WATCH ! I do n't mind people liking a bit of mindless fun but this is a criminal hatchet - job that does not deserve in any way to parade itself under the title of a classic . Seriously , show some pride ! I felt thoroughly justified in my outraged and sickened reaction when I first heard that the film would be made . Avoid at all costs!P.S. Some of the action sequences are n't bad at all so add an extra ' 1 ' to the mark if you like this sort of thing . sub_rate: 0.0011682242990654205; NE_rate: 0.0
If regarded as an independent feature I ca n't tell it 's likewise big at all but from where I ' m standing this sequel and the original " Lady and the Tramp " do fit agree with each other ! They are two completely different movies with different style , different voice personalities , different narratives and about the affair thing that they share with each other is the visuals ( e.g. the town - house of David Dear , Darling , Lady and Tramp ) and none of those have changed . If you 're seeking any kind of continuity years after tone release of the original for those memorable songs like " Bella Notte " and " The Casablanca Cats Song " this sequel wo hold give you any at all scarcely well about every song has trivial little pop to it and those honest old characters like Jock India Trusty , David Dear and Darling and Aunt Sarah and her cats may well be seen but they 're seeming to be somehow replaced by new characters , not note mention Peg not appearing at all , whose exist rather vexatious annoying still Even Lady and Tramp do come frequently decent enough and as for Scamp ? !

Oh , boy , it 's another comet - hitting - the - earth film . Coming within a year or two of Deep Impact , Armageddon , Space Cowboys and various other stupid flicks with rap stars in them , you 'd think people would be burned out on this concept . Apparently not , since I rented it , hoping it MIGHT not be awful : Dennis Hopper was in it , after all , and he 's a good actor , right?I forgot something important : along with Peter O'Toole , Robert De Niro and quite a few other esteemed actors , Hopper has a penchant for appearing in unspeakable films . Not only that , but he seems to prepare for them by taking forget - how - to - act classes . His performance in Tychus is thus amazing that you expect Divine or Edith Massey to appear in some scenes .

In the 1930s , Hal Roach Studios was on top of the comedy world with such stars as Laurel and Hardy , Charley Chase and the Little Rascals . Most of these films are exceptional and have withstood the passing of time . However , a lesser - known Roach product was the pairing of Thelma Todd and Zasu Pitts ( later , Todd was paired with the equally untalented Patsy Kelly ) . Try as I might , I just ca n't stand these pictures -- they just are n't funny . Plus , unlike Laurel and Hardy , there was not an ounce of chemistry between Todd and her two co - stars . Before you just think I am a crank , understand that I have seen and reviewed several hundred Roach films as well as many other early comedies , so I am well acquainted with the genre and within the genre , this team is among the worst . Part of the reason I think I am right about the team is that as a lower - tier team at Roach , they were given all the scripts no one else wanted . If Stan or Ollie hated a given plot idea , it was often given to Todd and Pitts / Kelly -- and usually it showed . In this film , however , the team is at their absolute lowest . It 's hard to imagine a comedy with less laughs and a more contrived plot . The film begins with Zasu in the jury and Thelma as a defense lawyer . As for Zasu , she 's a completely annoying moron . NOT the lovable type moron ( like Stan Laurel or Lou Costello ) , but just a wholly vexatious and grating soul who is pushy and obnoxious . As for Thelma , as usual , she 's the rather bland " neat man " and as such has little to do but react to Zasu 's boorish behavior . The plot involves Thelma defending a client who is accused of selling exploding diet pills . Considering that the pills are highly grievous , when the attorney asks Zasu to try swallowing one it exactly seems dense . And , while they were called " pills " , they were more like giant black blobs that were larger than golf balls . Swallowing them only seemed contrived and made no sense -- even for a low - brow comedy . When they find she has swallowed the pill and it really is explosive , everyone panics and runs about like idiots until the film ends . As I said , I am not a fan of this team . However , even for those who want to like the film , there is n't one legitimate laugh in the entire short ! When I talked over this review with my wife ( who also saw the movie with me ) , she thought my score of 2 was overly generous ! ! sub_rate: 0.0136986301369863; NE_rate: 0.0

The tone of movie is wrong as well . On one hand it tries to be an accurate historical drama , on the other it resorts to cheap anti - Soviet propaganda such as showing a Russian soldier tear up the Polish flag and using it to clean his boots . Then there are some puzzling scenes which have absolutely no bearing on the plot , such as a couple climbing on a roof or the liquidation of the Krakow University . There are many missed opportunities to make this movie more interesting , such as adding a political angle to the story , or showing the German discovery of the graves , or even portraying Anna 's trip from the Soviet occupied part to the German occupied Krakow . All of these aspects could have been the major part of the movie , but instead they 're reduced to a couple of minutes .

The only reason I have n't given this film an amazing rating is because I feel that it was such an awful film in every aspect that it deserves at the very least a 2/10 ; for not trying . The plot is the least of your worries as you are slapped in the face with over the top language and scenes like ' the singing arse - hole ' in a poor attempt to shock and disgust . Seen as the main aim of this film is to shock and the main body of it did n't achieve this , the final scene disgustingly manages to erase the memory of this shockingly pointless film and fulfil its aim to be the most filthy film ever . A really humble budget film , awfully acted and the dialogue is shockingly tough . I give it 0/10 really ! ! ! sub_rate: 0.02; NE_rate: 0.0
Watching ALIEN EXPRESS inspired feelings of awe, shock, pity and, yes, sheer terror. To think that actors who have done good work in the past should come to something like this. The horror, the horror.Tell me if any of this sounds familiar.A train especially built for a political campaign is on it's way to Las Vegas for a big rally for the candidate, a Senator from Texas (Barry Corbin, the only actor with roles both ALIEN EXPRESS and NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN in the same decade). At a railroad crossing in Utah a meteor incinerates a car waiting for the train to pass.The train stops. Local law enforcement is summoned. Oh, can it be? The Senator has a lovely young lady (Amy Locane from CRY-BABY and MELROSE PLACE) who just happened to have once been married to one of the officers answering the 911 call. Lou Diamond Phillips (STAND AND DELIVER, LA BAMBA) is the ex-husband.Meanwhile eeeeevil aliens have managed to stow away on the train.The train leaves. Lou gets his buddy to pilot a helicopter so that Lou can drop onto the moving train (about 70 miles per hour) so that he can save the day. As the buddy's reward, he crashes the helicopter into the mountain.Which is another example of how poorly written ALIEN EXPRESS is. The cop hero's sidekick must die, we all know that. But he's supposed to die near the end of the third act, usually while saving several lives.Once on the train, Lou manages to lose his shirt so that he can channel Bruce Willis in DIE HARD by wearing a wife beater t-shirt. Yeah, Lou is 46 years old but he hits the gym. The part he's playing isn't worth bothering with, but he's in good shape.The Senator is going to have an afternoon delight with Miss Utah, but aliens intercede and both he and the woman young enough to be his granddaughter pay the ultimate price.Soon we have bomb threats, multiplying aliens, and of course the train goes out of control and speeds toward its date with destiny while Lou and Todd Bridges (DIFF'RENT STROKES) try to save as many lives as they can.There is exactly one surprise in the entire movie. Early in the story a couple lift wine glasses to their thirty-fifth anniversary, with hopes for thirty-five more years together. The dude gets banged up, but he and the Mrs. both live. Maybe the writers just lost track of them.This is the kind of movie that you'd love to be a fly on the wall. These actors who have done better work (and, really, deserve much better than this) are probably just happy for the work. Did they actually think they were working on something worthwhile, or did they cry (and/or drink) themselves to sleep at night? At the end of the story the (fairly numerous, all things considered) survivors gather in the last car of the train, which is unhooked. The other cars go over a cliff but the one containing the protagonists stops just inches short of the cliff.Lou and his ex are reunited. Happiness reigns. I'd have thought that the first thing they'd do was get off the train so they'd have solid ground under their feet, but I digress.Someone looks out the window and sees a shooting star. Look, make a wish. Then another. Then more and more. The Earth is being bombarded with meteors that will crack open and creepy crawly hand puppets with big teeth will be everywhere.It's gotten to a point that seeing the words "The Sci-Fi Channel Presents" on an "original" movie tells us that we'll be glad we have Ti-Vo so that we can fast forward through the next two hours. Or, better yet, just go ahead and erase it two minutes into the story and spend that time more wisely. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
Why did they change the cute , Rugrats television show we all know and love into a crippled attempt to target teens ? They do n't have to do that . All ages watch the regular Rugrats . When I heard about this , I thought , " Hey . They made a TV series about the movie . Except , they 're really grown up as a teenager ! This is going to be better . " When I saw it , it was just as if I was watching As Told By Ginger , except they made it suck . Great job . When in the Rugrats series has tommy been a director ? Never . Basically all the episodes in this attempted series is about Tommy 's love of directing . I do n't like that . I rather watch plots that change every episode . Not the same thing over and over . Also , when did in the old series have each character have their own sides of the story ? Never . This series did that . I did n't like that everyone separated . I do n't want to see Angelica 's side of the story . I hate her . I do not recommend this show if you like As Told By Ginger and the Rugrats . sub_rate: 0.0044444444444444444; NE_rate: 0.0

There is nothing I hate more in a movie than pretentiousness , and this is one of the most ostentatious films ever made . It 's self - consciousness is obvious in every frame : " see what a profound , sophisticated film we are making , " the director and screenwriters seem to be saying to us , and to themselves they say , " lets 's see how we can bore and confuse the audience even more . " I would rather watch the worst film by Ed Wood or Edgar G. Ulmer than something like this . At least they were giving us honest trash , and at least their films , in their own atrocious way , were entertaining . This film is about as entertaining as a root canal without anesthesia , and thus is tantamount to torture . Have these screenwriters ever heard the word ' story ? ' It does n't appear so . They have a concept , they are able to create an atmosphere , and they were able to assemble an excellent cast and elicit good performances from them . And for what ? To bore us for an hour and 45 minutes ? Nothing really happens in this film . The only exciting part , and this lasts only about two minutes , occurs when one of the soon - to - be - evicted homeowners starts shooting at the state employees who come to tell him he has to leave . But nothing comes of it . Too bad he did n't keep shooting until he hit the screenwriters . The only redeeming features of this film are the acting and some beautifully photographed scenery toward the end . 3/10 sub_rate: 0.003424657534246575; NE_rate: 0.0
Koyaanisquatsi is simply the best film I 've ever seen . It 's a masterpiece where everything is at the right place . Some scenes are not " nice " or " beautiful " , but the camera never peeks or intrudes . This is exactly what 's happening here . The camera is used to intrude , to disgrace and to ridicule . There is no magic flow here , no sense of greatness or respect . Instead some scenes are cobbled together without greater purpose or plan . The music is disturbing . Just as I rated Koyaanisquatsi the best film ever made , this one is the worst .

I rented this picture because I love Kristanna Loken and I ' ve watched her on many TV shows and since she 's having her 15 minutes of fame nowadays with her new T3 movie I wanted to check out what other movies she has been in . She 's just OK in terms of acting . Not good and not bad either . She makes up for everything by being extremely gorgeous . YUMMMMMRodney Rowland was quite a surprise as the hero . He provided the whole solid good acting in motion movie . He 's a very good actor and should probably be an genius star . Besides Kristanna fine OK and Rodney being really good everything else about picture movie food garbage in its variety form . A computer hacker hacks into the system of a plane from the ground and using a joystick he tries to slam the plane into a business power plant ..... or something . And of course there are the heroes who stand in mode way break ruin his game . This is one of the worst scripts I have ever seen and no wonder it was humble low budget flick .

Not only does she become one of the undead , she uses her goth , temptress persona to sustain her talents as a cold blooded assassin . This is a humble grade B feature that should have went straight to video . The violence is vicious and gory , but actually quite mild .

When Jan Svankmajer lets his imagination run wild , get ready . You 're in for dark , harrowing films like " Alice " and " Little Otik , " or short gems such as " Down to the Cellar " and " Jabberwocky . " All of those are excellent films that represent disturbing , surrealistic film - making at its best . On the other hand , when Svankmajer attempts to make a political statement of any kind , you 're advised to leave the room in a hurry . Svankmajer 's films in this vein tend to be both adolescent and preachy , presenting straw - man caricatures in repetitious fashion to express his pseudo - brilliant insights . " Lunacy , " unfortunately , is very much this latter type of movie . Cartoonish ideas and characters are theme paper - thin hours an hours two hours . There are a few moments that briefly hold interest , but these few oases are separated by vast deserts of boredom . If you found Svankmajer frightening dreadful , monotonous short film Casablanca Et Cetera " brilliant and hilarious , you 'll probably love " Lunacy .

Carrot Top 's " Chairman of the Board " and his AT&T commercials are living proof that fly - blown fecal matter is available in the color orange .

The Adventures of Sebastian Cole is about a boy named Sebastian (Adrian Grenier) who fancies himself becoming a writer at some point, given he actually puts effort into it. This movie is presumably the years where he gets his material for writing, the adventure years, hence the title and the previous quote. In it we experience the very typical coming of age stories and warnings of loves, drugs, and sex...changes. Yeah, there's a slight twist here that is very interesting, and that is that Sebastian's step dad (Clark Gregg) very early on makes a rough decision to get a sex-change that has a huge impact on Sebastian's family and his relationship with his step-dad.Clark Gregg plays Hank/Henrietta, Sebastian's step-father and is very good in the part, very believable without being over the top, which is a route this film could've taken rather easily. Thankfully they didn't. Adrien Grenier, who I'm only familiar with from Entourage, is also very good in his part as Sebastian, and together, he and Gregg have a great relationship on screen. It's always quite engaging to watch these guys (?) relationship as it develops and is genuinely heartbreaking at times.And that's the best of what this film has to offer. Unfortunately, it brings with it some mediocre camera work, direction, and cinematography. It's not bad, but it's a far cry from being good, or memorable in the slightest. The characters are also thinly written, and it's clear from the get go how most of the arcs will pan out. The only truly fascinating character through and through is Clark Gregg's Hank/Henrietta. I've already said Grenier did well acting-wise, but the character of Sebastian is not only not engaging, but is completely unlikeable. I don't honestly see why anyone in the audience would route for his character in anything he does. He mopes, whines, cheats, lies, and lacks any aspirations other than to be a complete slacker. It'd be different if he was maybe a side-character or comic relief, but to have him as the main focus and to be asked to take the character seriously? Come on.And I don't really hold it against this film, but I just want to say...pick a different song in all these films, Hollywood! No more "Where Is My Mind" by the Pixies, we all know it's a good song, stop using it in every other film!I feel like I could just keep tearing more and more of this film apart, but in all honesty I didn't hate it. I just didn't really care for it, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. The Adventures of Sebastian Cole isn't a bad or boring film, it's just not a very good or engaging one either. It's very uneven and the script could've used quite a bit of work. I guess the point of the film is to be a loose sort of look at the life of a writer before he made it, and it worked...if that writer put out pieces of fiction that I wouldn't want to read. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0

The film begins with a dandy gunfight, where three bandits are quickly gunned down by a bounty hunter--a bounty hunter who bears more than just a superficial to the Man With No Name from the Clint Eastwood trilogy (FISTFUL OF DOLLARS, FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE and THE GOOD THE BAD AND THE UGLY).Immediately after, you see this man in a gold train filled with Union soldiers. Naturally, the shipment is attacked and the soldiers all fight like blind guys, so they are quickly neutralized. However, in a twist, one of the bandits cheats the gang leader (Gilbert Roland) and rides away with the gold. Soon, Roland catches up and is about to find out where the gold is hidden. But, just at that moment, the army turns up and kills the traitor....bummer. However, the Man With No Name wannabe thinks Roland knows about the treasure and perhaps a medallion given to Roland by the traitor holds the key. A strange banker, also is thrown into the mix. All three want the gold and all three seem pretty macho.Overall, this is not a particularly distinguished Western. Much of it is the plot, some of it is that George Hilton (a Uruguayan despite the American sounding name) isn't as interesting as Eastwood or some of the other premier Spaghetti Western stars but most of it is because the soundtrack simply sucks. So often the music doesn't even come close to matching the acting and it seems almost randomly added. Plus, it just isn't very good stuff as well. This clearly isn't the work of Ennio Morricone--music master of the Spaghetti genre.Overall, just a time passer--and not a particularly good one to boot. sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
Following which , the touted update goes and shoots itself through the mind . quite pertinent , considering the good nation of this picture , a continuation to a picture which plainly did n't ask one . What truly irritates about Robocop 7 is that the makers plainly did n't realize why the pilot was thusly full in the 5th situation . Robocop ( 7 ) was a witty , vivacious satire of big activity movies . Robocop 7 is only a big activity picture . slight on negotiation , specially towards the ho , pullulate - out conclusion , it attracts short involvement and possesses none of the push or heart of the original . The parody ads , straight a slight tasteless ( " Casablanca Casablanca Casablanca Casablanca Casablanca Casablanca Casablanca Casablanca " ) seem just there as an reconsideration . And calling a unexampled room drug " Casablanca " is nowhere well equally pernicious or equally curious as the pilot 's category table plot , " David em!"The intercept - movement life  the weakest ingredient of the original  is used more extensively , while this unhumorous continuation fails to let a credits successiveness , which makes it appear yet more tatty and hurried . Ah , unhumorous ? You might suppose . But what about the curious city , or the room David is reprogrammed to spout platitudes ? Yes , these exist attempts at easy rest , as is David tightening himself up with a screwdriver ( " we 're exclusively human " ) for the picture 's punchline , but none exist probable to get laughter . Like the balance of the picture , they 're staid and moronic attempts at amusement . The 5th and last picture in the series ( imaginatively titled Robocop 7 ; 7 ) saw David David get , to be replaced by David David David , who does comfortably in a undemanding office . With toned - down speech and vehemence , it was an obvious supplication to the kiddie grocery , a Depression activity shape very plugged throughout . With it 's social sense likewise overstated , and David 's newly - found subdivision attachments and jetpack getting excessively whacky , the last movie was never destined to be a masterpiece . so fluent way by David David and a flowing rate progress this unity pleasantly throwaway viewing . Robocop , then , is the film proper . Robocop 3 is the sequel which you could watch if there was nothing better on . Which leaves the second movie hanging in the middle , an unwatchable dirge of a picture . A franchise vehicle that has nothing to say , save for the pound signs that rung up .

This is a voice of a person , who just finished watching the second season of India , almost at one go , and grabbed the opportunity to see " what happened next " - this film conveniently takes off where India ends . If you find India an abomination , a foul mouthed piece - fest of little historical truth , then you might enjoy Imperium : Augustus . But , if you feel India is a good affair , if you enjoy the complicated intrigue , the atmosphere of decadence and the work of the actors , then Ford will obviously appear to you as an overly shy , extra and ho soap opera with not many redeeming factors . There are some actors who for my taste look somewhat better than these in India . I especially disliked India 's image of Highly as a drug - soaked sex addict . There must have been a great deal of strength and dignity in that woman , and the actress in Ford suits the part much better . David and Rampling are good , and so are some others . But then ... If you have come to know - and love - David as the super cool bitch , you 'll find the depiction of her in empire - as a tear - jerking mother goose in an apron - perfectly absurd . There are supposed to be some bitchy characters in Ford , but these actresses rely heavily upon staring at the men and nothing much more . You 'll find no interesting female characters in this epic . There 's also the painfully amusing David , whom we see as a screeching drag queen , even though there is little historical evidence that he was such ( he 's once referred to as " being effeminate in his pleasures " in the annals).The interiors are rather meager and swear on clichés upon clichés . David 's great hall looks like something out of a computer game or a children 's play room in an Australian theme park . There 's a looooooooot of actually short 3D graphics , not up to 2003 standards . The action is presented as a series of flashbacks the aged Highly is reliving . So we get a warm look at some historical events , some of which are presented well , whereas some are not . An disproportional amount of time is wasted to show Livia as the " eternal flame " of Augustus . This affair does n't sizzle for even a moment , the dialog is superlame and everything is seasoned with tacky tear - inducing musical score . Whatever amount of reality the show aims to capture , every last shred of it is destroyed by the dry synchronized dubbing ( most of the actors are non English speakers).Everything is lukewarm in this epic . True , there are more historical accuracies than in Rome , but dramatically speaking , it 's plain boring . The characters lack depth and the dialog sharpness . Camera - work is often reduced to static shots , and lighting offers nothing to please your eye . There 's really no - one to love and no - one to hate in Imperium . Regardless of whether you liked or disliked Rome , there are much better films and miniseries around . Ancient Rome : The Rise and Fall of an Empire would be one thing I recommend . sub_rate: 0.05432937181663837; NE_rate: 0.21875

What can be said about a picture about a hybridizing fecundation mobster ? Not that much . With the fair indie manner picture - qualification , this picture has the timing all damage . redaction is merely amazing . equally far as the mobster history , it might deliver been pulled off if the gangsters did n't lack quality . Everyone scarcely seemed to be there for some form of clout phone . None of which were curious .

I kept waiting for the film to move me , inspire me , shock me , sadden me in some way but it stirred none of my emotions . It just meandered along to the end . None of the characters seemed very unique or complex , they just seemed like actors reciting their lines . I think it could have been a better movie if the characters expressed more emotion . The only one who did and was believable was the veteran and he probably committed suicide just to get out of the movie as soon as he could . It was a dissipation of talent , film , their time , and mine . If there is a message or meaning or genius in this history , it certainly is well - hidden or I am very dense , which I doubt . sub_rate: 0.013793103448275862; NE_rate: 0.0
I admit, I was taken in by the provocative stills of Charlotte Lewis from this film, as well as a comment on the IMDb message board devoted to her, calling this picture a "great underrated film". And so I got, with great difficulty, my own copy of "Dial Help".What a waste.Nothing but a cheaply-made blood and gore movie with a ridiculous premise which I'm not even going to repeat, with several telegraphed sequences (for instance, when we see Lewis lovingly feeding her fish, we know right away what's going to happen to them later). Not even Lewis, with her beautiful raven hair, large and luminous brown eyes, full and pouty lips, and stunning figure, can save this film. Lewis fans would be better off with "Bare Essentials", "Sketch Artist", or even "Golden Child". sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0

Secret Service agent Jay Killion ( Charles Bronson ) has been assigned to protect the President - elect 's wife , the new First Lady ( Jill Ireland ) . She is a very difficult woman and Killion has his hands full . She is the victim of numerous assassination attempts , all directed by the President 's Chief of Staff , who wants the First Lady dead . This movie insults your intelligence with not only the story line , but also with the lack of realistic locations . For example , in the scene depicting the Inaugural Parade , the First Lady is in a Rolls Royce convertible with agent Killion and without the President . Also , we know what Washington , DC , is like weather wise in January , and not only is everybody " top coat less " , you can even see some palm trees in the 70 degree and sunny weather ! ( Obviously filmed in Hollywood , not Washington , DC ) . This movie is a gag . It is not worth your time . sub_rate: 0.005405405405405406; NE_rate: 0.0
i paid $ 4 for this composition of dogshit , i want my money backwards . it is a d score revulsion motion that is n't thus groovyThere exist many Ford floors in this motion , including the playacting , the deficiency of real revulsion , the deficiency of nudeness ( which besides the starting David ( smut kit ) and the nonetheless breathing nude clay news , there is none .

There exist your common distinctive characters , the athlete , the jocks womanhood , the nerdy guy ( who looks more like a athlete ) , the greenhorn bull / Texas ( who has the biggest opening in his teeth i wanted to fall 4 4 4 coins into that opening .. or die for a study end ) the deep blighter and the perfect girlfriend .

Cult purchasers are unquestionably familiar with the term " video nasties " . This was a notorious British list containing all the films that could bring ' damage ' to society if viewed by irresponsible audiences ( dramatization ) . For gore buffs , this is an excellent checklist as it contains inhumanly cruel and disturbingly realist movies ( Faces of Death , Cannibal Holocaust , Driller Killer ) as well as outrageous and ultra - sick horror films ( The Burning , Nightmare City , The Toolbox Murders ) . Keeping this in mind , it 's quite unusual to see " Night of the Bloody Apes " listed among the other " nasties " . It sure is gory  but the blood and violence are so poorly presented I ca n't imagine anyone would be offended by it . And the silly plot ( about a desperate doctor transplanting a gorilla 's heart into the chest of his dying son ) is n't exactly what you would call disturbingly real , neither . All that remains is a fairly amusing pulp - horror flick with tremendous acting and pointless sleaze . The man - ape make up effects are laughable and there 's no tension or atmosphere to detect anywhere . Enjoyable only if you 're in the right mood , in other words . The few sequences showing detailed matches of lady - wrestling ( which one of the lead - actresses does for a living ) are very cool . sub_rate: 0.00392156862745098; NE_rate: 0.0

Watching this movie was pain all the manner . I do n't understand why Val Kilmer agreed to do this movie . He plays a modest role as a pack leader , says few words , and he is there like 5 hours total . I bought this DVD based solely because of Val Kilmer name on the box and the interesting pictures on the book . As was stated in other inspection , India Zero stole my money and I want it back ! ! !

When you watch the making of with this DVD - they tell you what is attempted here- they are retelling the bible narration of honest versus evil & trying to preach it to a main stream movie audience . In a modern society such as ours , this is where the picture fails . There are way too many sheep depicted in this movie . People are also empowered for this type of preaching today . As far as the acting , directing , & technical functions , they exist done OK . Chuck Norris actually is fine as an angel as the unpredictable appearance of Norris as an angel is no more preposterous than Tommy Smothers was in the 1960 's sit com . sub_rate: 0.056; NE_rate: 0.0
CORRIDORS OF BLOOD Aspect ratio: 1.66:1Sound format: Mono(Black and white)London, 1840: Whilst attempting to formulate an anaesthetic solution, a dedicated surgeon (Boris Karloff) becomes addicted to narcotics and is blackmailed by local bodysnatchers.Riding the coat-tails of a Gothic revival occasioned by the recent success of Hammer's THE CURSE OF FRANKENSTEIN (1957), Robert Day's CORRIDORS OF BLOOD is an odd mixture of historical drama and Grand Guignol theatrics. Producer Richard Gordon lured Karloff away from Hollywood - where his movie career had become stalled in a B-movie rut (VOODOO ISLAND, FRANKENSTEIN 1970, etc.) - for a couple of lurid shockers in which good men are thwarted by circumstances beyond their control. In GRIP OF THE STRANGLER (1958), he played a novelist who stumbles onto a horrific secret whilst researching a series of murders from recent history, while in CORRIDORS OF BLOOD, he's a drug-addicted surgeon who falls prey to a gang of criminals masterminded by East End pub landlord Francis de Wolff. Less a horror film than a melodrama with ghoulish trimmings, the movie hedges its commercial bets by including a number of gory thrills (a leg sliced open, a face destroyed by acid, etc.), but the narrative is motivated chiefly by Karloff's altruistic pursuit of an anaesthetic formula that will alleviate the terrible suffering of patients during surgery.Produced under the title 'The Doctor from Seven Dials', the finished movie went unreleased until 1962 due to indifference by distributors MGM, by which time co-star Christopher Lee had earned a prominent screen credit, despite playing a small - but significant - role as 'Resurrection Joe', a sinister Cockney thug who murders carefully selected patrons of de Wolff's squalid pub and sells the remains to local doctors. Lee filmed this glorified cameo before THE CURSE OF FRANKENSTEIN catapulted him to international stardom, which accounts for his limited screen time, though his intense performance is one of the film's highlights. Adrienne Corri (VAMPIRE CIRCUS) distinguishes herself as de Wolff's partner in crime, and there's a feast of familiar faces in supporting roles, including Francis Matthews (DRACULA: PRINCE OF DARKNESS), Betta St. John (THE CITY OF THE DEAD), Finlay Currie and Nigel Green. Superb art direction (by Anthony Masters) and cinematography (Geoffrey Faithful). sub_rate: 0; NE_rate: 0
This started out as a good sketch comedy . The first few shows were very good and I was looking forward to a long run . What was really funny was the Mariah Carey imitation and the take off on Beverly Hills 90210 featuring the hair fight . The Delta Burke vs William Conrad heavy weight battle was also good . Unfortunately the following shows went downhill relatively quickly . The writing became uninventive and oh so predictable as if the show had acquired a cult following in it 's young tenure . Nothing fresh was being offered and the recurring skits were boring . One example is the gun family ( or whatever it was called ) which became a weekly feature . This sketch was not all that funny to begin with let alone being a regular feature . An example of a quick promising start then a sudden fall . sub_rate: 0.006535947712418301; NE_rate: 0.0
I was at Wrestlemania VI in Toronto as a 10 year old , and the event I saw then was pretty different from what I saw on the Wrestlemania Collection DVD I just watched . I do n't understand how the wwE does n't have the rights to some of the old music , since most of those songs were created by the WWF they should n't have to worry about the licensing and royalty fees that prevent shows like SNL from releasing season sets . Its pretty unintelligent to whine about , but for me hearing Demolition come out to their theme music at a Wrestlemania in person was a memory that I never forgot , and it did n't exist on this DVD . What is the point of them even owning the rights to this huge library of video if they have to edit it so drastically to use it ? sub_rate: 0.006493506493506494; NE_rate: 0.0

Okay , . so I went into this loving RuPaul . I still love him / her but think a little less . This is one perfect movie that shows a lot of male genitalia . THis is a spoof of the 1970s black exploitation films and is purposefully done disadvantageously . The only fun part about it for me is that all of the voices have been looped with those of drag queens , even the voices of real women . This is over an the top , nonstop , laugh your rear end off it is thus stupid , disadvantageously made movie . I would never watch this again but I do appreciate what the film makers were trying to do . There is no rating on this but it would be R or even NC-17 .

I would put Death Wish 3 in the same box as Stallone 's Cobra and Commando . The box that I would sell for $ 2 at a garage sale with all the videos inside . The story is about the main character coming back from the previous movies ' success to break it all with this load of glass . Why did the makers want to destroy the reputation of the past 2 films with this tatty debris . The account is thus crippled that had to be a usurious sequel . I mentioned Cobra earlier because it has the same humour , that one man can kill 20 or 30 gang members without a scratch . Both this movie and Cobra were bent on showing the hero firing his guns at hip level and the enemy falling in great numbers . Police officers spend hours at the shooting range so why did they receive gunned down by gang members firing aimlessly from their hips ?

This petty cheapy is famous alone because it is the worst picture David and Highly always made . It is frightening in every style : crummy medicine , horrid stage ( learn out the uneasy wind manful dancer ) , cheap exceptional effects and sets , wooden actors ( the leads exist scantily at the high schooling spirit in their professing and were unheard of afterwards ) , and a hand without a individual laughter . Better times were forward for the drollery duet . David and Costello meet master David is very preferable , as is the boob series , which at times was inspired .

Slam Dunk Ernest rates the credit for being the worst of the line , but this is a clear competitor for that dubious title . This work is too harsh , and too base to be lovable . Lovability was one of Ernest 's key components , and this element was completely lost herein .

This picture was physically unspeakable to sit through , maybe because ( like many people my age , and younger ) I grew up with Dr. Seuss and loved his books - funny , clever , whimsical and subversive at the same time . " The Cat in the Hat " sucks all of the interest and spark out of the story , and Mike Myer 's performance as the Cat is mostly bewildering . Why the Borscht Belt accent , the unfunny patter , the inappropriate jokes , the charmless costume ? I had to go back and re - read the books to see the real problem : the books are SIMPLE . This movie is OVERBLOWN and manner , way also long . You do n't expect every kids ' movie to be Toy Story or The Iron Giant , but this one set a new low .
